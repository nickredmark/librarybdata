<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">with uh talking so let&#39;s get straight to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.760" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">the questions we&#39;ve got a question from</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">cell hypnosis and autogenic training to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">help with focus</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">flow and to deal with the monkey mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">especially for triggering and intrusive</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">do you have good sources for these</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:59.199" style="s2">practices thanks</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">um so uh hypnotism is is</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.199" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">uh just to be clear all hypnotism is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">ultimately self-hypnotism</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">um anybody who&#39;s hypnotizing is just</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">providing you with some external cues</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">and some mirroring and some</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">a redirection of attention so that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">actually hypnotize yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">um and we also have to remember that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">people are not equally hypnotizable</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s variation that way but</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">hypnotizability</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">seems to be heritable which means</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s pl and matt rosano argues this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible that it has been selected</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">for um</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">across human evolution i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">probably with matt rosano</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">uh back to the upper paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">transitions it was probably enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">with shamanic healing a capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">being healed by shamans</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">um again when i say that i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">anything supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">um i mean uh you know the shaman is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">doing ritual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">uh that can trigger uh self-hypnosis</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">that can magnify</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">the placebo effect and that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s pretty much the only</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">significant health care you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:05.920" style="s2">for the significant significant and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">effective health care</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.920" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">you have for a very long time so i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">uh hypno hypnotism uh in this overall</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">project would be a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">now for a long time there was that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">that was sort of that&#39;s an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">uh uh evolutionary psychology argument</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">uh some people still doubt its existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s no longer a plausible leg</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">to stand upon</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">people were saying uh individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">faking it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">uh but then amir raz did a bunch of just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">and he got you know canada research</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">chair just did a whole bunch of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">experimental work</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">uh showing that um you could hypnotize</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">people to overcome the stroop effect</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">and all kinds of other uh automatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">processing cognitive processing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">potential processing that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">can cannot override even with belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">etc etc so um everybody is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">basically flipped because of that very</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">seminal research</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">uh to come to the conclusion that hit</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">hypnotism is a real phenomena it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">self-hypnotism</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">now uh amir uh raz and michael lischett</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">published a book uh on uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">hypnosis and meditation or hypnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">mindfulness oxford university press</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">um and uh myself and leo ferraro</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">um have a paper in there called</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">reformulating the mindfulness construct</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">and we picked up on some work</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">by amir raz and also by a colleague of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">uh uh norman farb norman farr pointed</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">that most uh if you take a careful look</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">at the instructions people</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">are giving in mindfulness classes you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">guiding people into a mindfulness state</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">and i do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">uh all the time many of you know that i</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">do the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">weekday morning meditation contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">roman farb pointed out that that um that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">those instructions are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">very similar very very similar</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">uh to hypnotic induction and so there</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">what what leo and i argued is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">a connection a causal interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">uh between uh hypnotism um the power of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">and uh mindfulness the power of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">and they can actually interford and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">interpenetrate</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">each other and we we strongly suggested</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">building on that evolutionary argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">from matt rosano that i was just talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">about a couple of minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">that in shamanic ritual you had these</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">things together um so that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">something like um hypnotism</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">affording and strengthening people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">ability to get into mindfulness states</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">and then mindfulness um really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">increasing people&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">to enter into states of absorption and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">flow that increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">their capacity for being hypnotized and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">i do think they&#39;re so i i do think</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a good scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">basis now or trying to parse out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">then put</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">back together a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">mindfulness um uh and hypnotizability</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">argued uh in that paper in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">the chapter in that book so what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">means specifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">is i think we need i think the place i</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">would argue the place we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">for how to put those two together</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">um was is within um the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">ritual on cognition</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">paying attention for and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">experimentally manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">mindfulness variables and hypno</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">hypnotism variables</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">so i think i mean i&#39;d like to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">and i&#39;d like to do that moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">and then i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">integrate that with work done by</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">nick wickelman and others about the use</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">of metaphor and an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">the language of coaching and how you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">actually train people because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">it borders on both mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">hypnotism because you give these people</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">these inactive metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">you tell them you know uh you know run</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">up run sprint but sprint as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">running up a hill</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">or be a spring as you&#39;re moving around</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">and people sort of enact this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">um all these kinds of bizarre things</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">that we take is sort of natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">but nick&#39;s done a lot of work pulling</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">out um</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">that the role of sort of inactive</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">perspective and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">so i think all three of these need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">studied um nobody&#39;s doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">and then that leads me to my second</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">second part of my answer which</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t recommend any good practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">work on this</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">uh precisely because i think that most</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">of the practical manuals</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">i haven&#39;t read them all and i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">largely ignorant but</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">something of a mixture of a supposition</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">and conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">i think because this emerging science is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">not available to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">the was not available to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">have written all these books about</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">hypnotism</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">that these books are seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">out of date and probably obsolete um so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">i would hesitate to recommend any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">what i can predict is that much better</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">applications of hypnotism should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">coming down the pipe</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">as this further scientific work on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">relationships between hypnotism and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">mindfulness which is already going</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">and then also i would propose the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">relationships between hypnotism</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">and things like coaching imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">using imagination enacted imagination</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">and coaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">as that starts to unfold so it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">answer i think but</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">the point is that that that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">really interesting phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">and i have published on it because i do</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">think it&#39;s an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">uh to consider all right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">velasquin you had a question last time</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">yeah this don&#39;t i&#39;m i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">wondering whether or not to ask it but</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">it&#39;s nice and quick so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">i john i noticed the qualifications that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve gotten to do the work that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">seems to be at least online is basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">a cognitive science bachelor&#39;s degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">all the way up to phd in philosophy um</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">i was wondering if i wanted to get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">your work</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">would you recommend doing a load of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">philosophy or can i just sort of do</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">cognitive science bachelor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">then maybe like a masters in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">and then what like what&#39;s your advice</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great uh so the yeah the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">it worked uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">it says because u of t doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:49.519" style="s2">graduate cogside program</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">i actually did my phd basically in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.519" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">cognitive science like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">my thesis is actually entitled the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">naturalistic imperative in cardinal</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">but i had to formally do it within uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">so what my career went i got a ba and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">m.a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">in sort of pure philosophy and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">what i wanted to zero in on and i got</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">the uh honors</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">uh bsc in cognitive science and then i</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">went back and did my phd</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">uh basically in cognitive science i</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">would recommend just do straight</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">um you&#39;re gonna be doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">philosophy in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">and there are now graduate programs in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">cognitive science that are quite good</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">andy clark&#39;s in edinburgh is very good</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">we have one in canada</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">at carleton university in ottawa i know</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">it&#39;ll be cold</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">uh well i guess it won&#39;t be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">probably going to be online for a while</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">but those are two excellent places in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">which you do</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">can do graduate work now that being said</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">i recommend and this is how the cog side</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">program is actually designed at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">university of toronto</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">so the it&#39;s designed so that you do a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">double major you do cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">and you major in another discipline one</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">of the home disciplines like psychology</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">or computer science</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">or philosophy or right uh or linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">so i recommend that all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">definitely in your undergrad do a double</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">major</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">outside like me philosophy that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">thing you&#39;re most interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">and then as you go through your graduate</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">degree make sure you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">a try and get as much of that double</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">doubling all the way along</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">research shows that if you have just</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">pure cog psi</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">you will be out competed by like if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">try to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">a job in a psych department or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">like that you&#39;ll be out competed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">who has a pure psych phd</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">but the same research shows that if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">have a cog</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">psi and psych degree you will</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">out-compete the person</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">that has just the psych degree um</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">especially if</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">the department is much more cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">oriented</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">um so i hope that&#39;s helpful feedback for</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">yeah thanks very much</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">great you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">hi john hey strong</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">that&#39;s doing chewing up a lot of my my</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">question because i just realized it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">bit of a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">sorry i did and i i i did a quick read</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">but it so you want to talk to me about</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">pan psychism</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">uh and contrast continuity and proposing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">something sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">um alternative uh to what jp marceau has</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">proposed so</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">please yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">so i was gonna read it out i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">very interested in your conversations</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">with jp morso regarding pan psychos and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">versus deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">recently you mentioned that strong</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">emergence is something that many people</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">find hard to credit and i would have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">count myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">as being among that group however you</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">did say that psychism had similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">weaknesses with respect to the interplay</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">of mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">and that this makes it hard to judge</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">which of the two theories are superior</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">so given that i also fall into the pan</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">cyclist camp</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">i would like to propose something to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">and i would like to invite you to take</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">your best shot at undermining it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">you said that the weakness that pan</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">i was just laughing strong</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">okay you said that the weakness that pan</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">cyclism has</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">is that it isn&#39;t clear why in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">inanimate object such as rocks don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">have conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">or basically if matter is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">possess some form of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious how these rudimentary</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">consciousnesses are supposed to combine</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">to give us self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">does my summary more or less get the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">gist of your position yeah i just want</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">to emphasize that last point because</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">um it seems to me that pan psychism</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">like you and i think you&#39;re being an</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">accurate representative</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">they they criticize uh deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">they reject strong emergence it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">me that they invoke some version of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">strong emergence</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">and they say the you know something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">self-awareness and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">strongly emerges</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">out of all the micro consciousnesses</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">that don&#39;t possess</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">intelligence and self-awareness and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">for me that undermines why i would</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">choose pan psychism</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">over a deep continuity if both have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">rely on strong emergence</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">then the first pre uh seems to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">much more conservative</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">ontology going for it and is much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">in concert with sort of existing uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">scientific ontology</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of the argument from i</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">think i said the same thing but i just</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">want to put a few points of emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">yeah okay so that&#39;s great um i thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">you&#39;d put it better than i could</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">and yeah i basically agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">everything that you said there so</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">what i would like to propose is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">that space itself is the pan psych</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">which is to say that under this</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">hypothesis space locates</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">map to the body solid i think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">making this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">movie it was strong so you say the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">two sentences again</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">you broke up for me i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.720" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">broke up for other people maybe your mic</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">was being moved or something like i</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">didn&#39;t get it i just didn&#39;t hear it what</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">did you just say the last two sentences</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">okay um so what i would like to propose</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">is the idea that space itself is the pan</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">psych which is to say that under this</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">space locates matter by being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">are you with me so far okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">i think that this move uh removes</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">several of the weaknesses of the form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">pan cycles and the jp advocated</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">first of all while i can say that i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">seen mata i can&#39;t say that i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">seen space</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">space is as much a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">abstraction to me as your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">i have no reason to think that i have</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">direct experience of either</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">however scientific observation shows</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">that space and matter indeed interact in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">some manner</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">specifically as einstein put it space</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">tells mata how to move and mata tells</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">space how to bend</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">but i would like to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">observation by stating that mata</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">potentially also fuses space in the form</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">of singularities</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">otherwise known as black holes if mata</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">can bend and fuse space</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">then could it not also perhaps break</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">space and could this breaking of space</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">not somehow form the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">consciousness as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">um i&#39;ve got one more graph there i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">know if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">if you want to cut in there or not okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">well um maybe i&#39;ll cut in here but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">try not to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">uh sort of overwhelm you with a wave of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">so do you get a chance to come to your</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">last paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">so i&#39;m not so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">i mean this this was actually proposed</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">and by all of all people was proposed by</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">newton</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">a leibniz clark debate in which clark</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">who was basically just a puppet for</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">newton</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">was debating leibniz and uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">newton actually proposed something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">that space was the censorium of god</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">and then people all jumped on him for</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">being a heretic</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">but so and the arguments are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">there seems to be an element of of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">barclay&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">too in there or maybe hume so when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">say you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">see space so</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">i mean a traditional response to that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">uh you don&#39;t see space you see motion</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">and that is to see space uh which</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">so you you see extension in things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">are not moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">and you see moving and move and you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">movement in things that aren&#39;t moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">and then right the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">category that makes sense of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">together is space</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">so are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">that that that set oh let me ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">question that i&#39;ll shut up</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">that second move of going from extension</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">in things</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">and being aware of motion and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">saying okay there&#39;s space because</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">of that that that&#39;s the that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">a pure abstraction it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">that you directly experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">am i am i understanding you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s something like like hume&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">uh argument with respect to causality</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">that you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">ever experience causality right so in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">other words you shouldn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">empirical proof for this</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">well i shouldn&#39;t necessarily expect to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">have empirical proof</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">for your mind if it&#39;s if there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">a there&#39;s a barrier that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">that cuts it off right but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">mean that you don&#39;t have a mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">right and so i mean sort of the response</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">right that&#39;s come you know post quine</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">and davidson</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">um right out of that is well</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">we the you know the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">human standard of empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">is you end up having empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">for nothing you end up with human</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">and then they point out that right in</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">science most empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">is for non-directly experiential things</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">right so but i&#39;m saying so you can as</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">you make the move with space you make</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">the move with</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">mind and we don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">space is we can only speculate using</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">mental abstractions and formulations we</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no at least today we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">of a test that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">to directly um perceive the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">space itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a mystery to us</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">okay but but again that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">that that same argument would work for</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">uh bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">right or or at least up till recently</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">when we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">you know microscopes uh because we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">only infer their existence but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">turned out to be real</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">right so well i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t i expect you&#39;re not doubting the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">reality of consciousness or space right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">we but we know that or we we act as if</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">both of these phenomena are real</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">i i think i just misunderstood you i</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">think when you said there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">i take empirical evidence to be anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">that provides</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">you know a basis for inferences to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">theoretical entities</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">um because like i said okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">i might be being a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">strict than uh with my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">empire</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">yeah i do think it&#39;s like i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">there&#39;s empirical evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">you know for uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">you know dinosaurs living dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">i think there&#39;s empirical evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">space that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying something</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">um so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">well actually i think my last paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">will speak to this um</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">directly and then anyway so while i</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">you said go ahead while i understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">that i&#39;ve done nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">to explain the mystery of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">interaction of matter and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">i think that if we ever gain the means</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">to investigate the equally mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">relationship of space and matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">that the idea that i propose to you may</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">well become something that we can test</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">for in a falsifiable manner</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">and as a bonus i think this way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">dealing with con the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">would still be amenable to accounting</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">for the world in terms of tnm</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">information and the bridge of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">intelligibility between them which is i</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">believe what you&#39;re using deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">to to actually do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">and so yeah i&#39;m just going to steel man</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">your argument a bit i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">is increased uh by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">by the the move it&#39;s not rich consensus</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s a powerful move within physics</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">for information realism to regard</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">information as a fundamental um</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">ontological building block along with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">matter and energy space and time</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">and the reason you have to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">precisely because of paradoxes around</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">black holes</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">and other uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">other situations in which our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">our normal conceptions of space and time</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">are being warped uh to use star trek</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">language i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">um so that lends some initial</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">uh to what you&#39;re saying uh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">how else to respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">uh strong um</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">there it it like i said i i do think</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">that i mean you have some historical</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">precedent uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">platinus thought that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">contemplating even inanimate things</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">i mean he had a really interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know yeah well i think i</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">i i could sorry i could jump in there</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">from your book cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">buddhism lectures when you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">describing the formal cause you used the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">form is kind of like shape but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean exactly shape and i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">while you were doing that because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">were trying to allude to the structural</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">functional organization but what i</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">what my response to you there is that i</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">think that there can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">there is an argument to be made that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">space is exactly the formal cause and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">space is shapeness itself right</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">yeah so yeah yeah and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">if we both agree that space exists</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">then space is a real potential uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">in that way yes a real formal cause not</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">conjectured possible thing well</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">i i would say a real possibility um</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">but i mean i prefer yeah i prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">talk of time in terms of potentiality so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">that might just be a bit nitpicky and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">besides the point for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t yeah i that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s fine i was i was using</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">potentiality because we were invoking</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">the aristotelian framework</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">okay fair enough fair enough okay well</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">and i think and i mean i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">um analogous uh between</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">um sort of the way things</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">i mean this is a white hedian argument</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">the way things</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">are constantly moving from</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">indiscriminacy to determinacy</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">and they are regulated by that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">formal causation and that&#39;s analogous</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">to something like relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">and i&#39;ve also argued there&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">continuity between intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">and if we throw in informational realism</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m trying to make your argument</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">more plausible in my own mind i hope you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">you understand that um fair enough yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">yeah but i mean i i i&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s now a position i</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">well i&#39;ve already i already take it</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">seriously i already take pansexism</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">uh but now even more so that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">can say at least at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">right um the one extra point that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">could put in there just to tie it in</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">with your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">is that i very much see space as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">perspective on matter so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">well mata there would be more</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">propositional to me yeah that&#39;s platynus</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s very much platinum of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have our notion of matter he</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">has that uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">on bodies he would say but very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">very very analogous um is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">what&#39;s the name of it is it that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">on nature contemplation in the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">excellent book on that aeneid i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">to remember the author</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">ah sorry anyways</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">uh the author wrote a book an extended</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">commentary on platinus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">aeneid nature contemplation of the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">in which she goes into that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">that idea about everything is engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">an act of contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">you might find that very uh very useful</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve always found it something i keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">returning back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">uh like because i do think that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">platonus&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">profound energy so maybe take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">it and see if that gives you something</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">you could talk to me about</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">in the future oh yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">um yeah so and the only thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">left out there was with all this in mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the most cunning philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">jiu-jitsu that you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">master against this idea but um we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">taken a lot of time i think i&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">your steel manning instead</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">okay that&#39;s fine um you you you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">like i said i i don&#39;t see and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">admitted this upright so i&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">pigeonhole you or jujitsu at all like i</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:07.039" style="s2">said i don&#39;t think that resolves the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">uh that i had about the competition</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">between deep continuity and pan psychism</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">maybe it does well but i don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">yeah i i would just say that i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">this if space is the pan in whatever uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">way mata breaks space it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">a strong emergence it&#39;s a weak emergence</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">in that case</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s the advantage okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">well i like i think we should i think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">can go back and forth on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">okay uh so maybe we should leave it here</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">uh and i don&#39;t wanna i&#39;ll leave you i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">leave you with the last word to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">yeah well um i&#39;ll think it over some</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">and and get back to you and check out</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">the tightness and maybe you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">something more useful to say then</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">thanks john thank you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">thanks you had a question last time that</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">coming up inside of me</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">uh just looked at it okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">thank you oh my memory was accurate</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">uh so the uh the question that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">hoping to ask you uh last week um</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">i have some awareness that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">it&#39;s malformed or misframed</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m pretty confident that you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">able to answer it in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">productive</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">um what i was wondering is uh from your</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">as a cognitive scientist and as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">educator if you have any general advice</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">to people uh about how to um</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">to appropriate and uh optimize their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">their process of learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">um and what i have in mind here</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">especially is um</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">jordan hall&#39;s idea about um trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">emulate</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">special forces in in the sense of uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">getting that ongoing adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">like jordan said so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">bringing that that out</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">so um i&#39;m actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">to finish up it&#39;s mostly written and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">book on plausibility understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">called plausibility and pedagogy um</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">and so from the teacher&#39;s side i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">trying to argue for shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">from knowledge to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">because trying to get people to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">retainers of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">um i&#39;m not saying we should stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">that but trying to make that the primary</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">thing we do in education</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">is bloody obsolete and covet has made</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">that even more relevant</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">right um and and the universities i see</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">them struggling to try and catch up</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">uh because when a lot of the evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">is still from the paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">paper and pencil era in which you see</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">how much</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">information people have stored in their</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">otherwise fallible memory</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">and once we get into cova that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">completely irrelevant because of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">on those kinds of tests people can just</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">massively cheat and academic</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">dishonesty is skyrocketing right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">around that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">so a lot of people are just struggling</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">and so um i guess sorry i i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry should calm down my</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">my tone is taking on i&#39;m taking on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">tone of vindication</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">which is a little bit hubristic but i do</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">think an emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">on understanding and and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">goes along with what jordan is saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">is much more crucial and then that has</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">with two things i talked about at length</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">but i talk about even more at length in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">the book</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">i talked about them in the video series</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">which is plausibility and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">and enhancing that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">and figuring and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">um doing it in a way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">enhance the cycle uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">that&#39;s found within deep learning within</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">neural networks you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">you want to get a convergence that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">compresses</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">um to some kind of construct</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">upon which you have optimal grip then</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">elegantly projects</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">into and transfers to many different</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">domains and introduces variation</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">that then feeds back in and you get deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">learning and that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">balance between deep convergence deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">elegance</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">um implausibility i argue is how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">basically turn knowledge into</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">uh by train by tracing out ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">different pieces of information</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">different pieces of knowledge are</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">relevant to each other and convergence</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">relevant to each other in elegance and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:44.880" style="s2">relevant to each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">in in the higher order balancing between</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">convergence and elegance</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">so and i have actually been explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">teaching that way um and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">and what that involves very much</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">the the convergence saw it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">different aspects of sort of socratic</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">method the convergence side</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">is uh the the method of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">um considering many possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">intensifying the problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">until you get a convergence uh to a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">and then you use that to then trigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">convergence towards a proposed answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">from which you then want something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">a socratic insight</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">for how it&#39;s virtuous how it can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">applied in many different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the method i&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">using um</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">and in the teaching of my courses</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">and i justify it again in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">notion that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">plausibility is the normative standard</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">we should be using</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">uncertainty is not a relevant standard</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">and in any ways any of our claims to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">certainty</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">we suppose plausibility let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">a quick</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">example of what i mean like empirical</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">okay so i i can&#39;t uh consider</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">um all uh possible hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">i i spilt it for the plausible ones and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">then when i&#39;m designing my experiment</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">i can&#39;t control for all possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">confounds i filter for the plausible</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">and then once i get my results i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">derive all of the implications</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">so i filter for the plausible one so</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">plausibility is presupposed before</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">during and after</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">any empirical investigation so if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">understand plausibility and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">if we promote and emphasize training</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">more explicitly uh to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">generate plausibility and thereby create</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">deeper understanding profounder</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">i think that is actually the tool that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">their they&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">relevant to how things are changing</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">so giving people a way to increase their</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">demands that we emphasize a whole bunch</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">um so capacities uh for</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">there is part of the design criteria for</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">um sort of innovating pedagogy to</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">um but i&#39;m also wondering</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">um and this is sort of another front</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">maybe or another um</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">angle of the question is um</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">how can people go about figuring out</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">alluding to here is the relevance</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">at most an aspirational argument for</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s all we&#39;ve ever been</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">this what i just said has now been</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">made much more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">i think i mean and so this is for me the</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">thing uh and you know and the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">basically made this argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">um cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">wisdom and virtue and i argued that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">virtue is the beauty of wisdom each</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:49.359" style="s2">virtue is a way of being wise in a</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">to be done</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.200" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">um organized ultimately around the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">meaningful life and human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">uh cultivate the virtues that reduce</p>

<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">and enhance meaning in life and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">you know cultivate what surrounds that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">and afford it</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m proposing sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">expanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">concentric circles um and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">to do it and i i see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">doing that these people that i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">um and i think i think where did i argue</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">this can&#39;t remember i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">version of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">make a much better uh you know</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">tends to be just massively</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">misinterpreted in sort of a hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">or romantic fashion i think if you find</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">everybody i think that should</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">start with the perennial practices of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">reducing self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">enhancing meaning in life and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">find those things that fit</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">their particular historical cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">context environmental context</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">their own idiosyncratic psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">and their personality variables</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">so that they can build a surrounding set</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">of affording practices</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">and hobbies or vocations or professions</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">and then build upon those etc etc um</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">why i&#39;m recommending that is first of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">all on one hand it has</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">i think a higher uh one of the higher</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">chances of being</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">successful because these perennial</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">patterns are constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">of human well-being and therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">should always be inherently valuable</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">and secondly because</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">the skills that are attendant to it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">um and wonder um and aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">are precise rationally more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">construed right</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">as i&#39;ve argued these are also the skills</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">that seem to be the most reliably</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">generalizable across changing contexts</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">and situations</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">then you know and then and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">take a look at you do the reverse you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">take a look at people&#39;s lives who have</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">gone well or going well</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">they tend to have that sort of structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">um where they&#39;ve got sort of reliable</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">skills and habits and virtues meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">life and reducing self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">and then they sort of build outward upon</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">um in that supporting uh fashion now of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that is not a deterministic thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">i just said people get lucky</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">people uh you know lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">get lucky</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">uh lots of people who do what i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">said you know suffer ill fate</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">uh we are only human beings we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">gods and the universe is indifferent to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">our narrative projects</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">um mostly um so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">i think how you zeroing on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">is what&#39;s virtuous and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">and then what supports that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">and then what supports the support etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s how i would answer that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s it sounds like there&#39;s almost an</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right and that that would be i</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">mean i didn&#39;t make that argument that&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">on it very well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">um is you know that has a high</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">possibility of getting you to sort of</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">so just just one last thing uh as far as</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">reading for getting a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">understanding of plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">um i&#39;m supposing that would be uh elia</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">milgram&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">yeah i mean one of the i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">sorry this is uh i think the book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">coming out is going to be that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">running i think it&#39;s the better</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">what it does is it takes rescher&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">and milgram&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">and also the stuff from deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">and sort of puts it all together into</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">well a plausible argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">right a plausible integrated argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">but those are the people like milgram</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">and rusher</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a new book out called plausible</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">reasoning um</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">but but um there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s lots of good books on</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">the other side on understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">uh anthologies uh rect has some books on</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">understanding there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">an anthology from i think 2013 on</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">scientific understanding there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">very good anthologies out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">on the philosophy and psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s mostly coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">but if you want sort of i mean sorry</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">but the the i what i&#39;ve tried to do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">draw all that literature together into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:32.079" style="s2">single</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">argument in a single i&#39;m sort of just uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.079" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">looking for what to read in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">i suppose yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">um if i if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">uh i mean if maybe we could work out a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">way in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">um i could email you uh the draft as it</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">on the understanding and then that also</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">has an extensive bibliography in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">that way you&#39;d get both the draft and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">the bibliography</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">i would need from you some kind of you</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">thought into right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">i i have so many things that are 90 done</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">will in turn free up more space</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">at least that&#39;s the fantasy i tell</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just somewhat convoluted</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">thing um so um</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">i was brought up uh within a a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">um christian upbringing and then in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">teens i basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">rejected that because i encountered uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">really some very uh profound and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">thought-provoking world literature</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">sort of broke things open for me um but</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">that of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:17.280" style="s2">um bought with it um</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">i guess uh my own um</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.280" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">extreme version of something like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">i went looking around um</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">and i entered into university and i took</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">a philosophy course and i met</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">the figure of socrates in the work of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">plato&#39;s and this had a profound</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">impact on me um and i i saw in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">something that i was hungry for this</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">topic of wisdom self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">life of aspiration and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">those topics really really moved me</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">and i decided to take that out</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">but as in fact not that much further</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">in academic philosophy all of the you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">know that whole socratic project of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">off the table you couldn&#39;t even take a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">course when i was an undergrad on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">stoix or or</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">or the neoplatonus that&#39;s how that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">truncated things were and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">it was all it was all about knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">and epistemology and not about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">and and the love of it and so that i got</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">very disillusioned that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">um in one sense i i i came to really</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">um the meta science and um</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">the cultural critique that academic</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">philosophy was affording me</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">so i continued on and i got my ma but by</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">that time</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">i became very sort of disenchanted with</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">that project</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">and i actually left school for a year</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">and beca and i i fell into a pretty dark</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">and then i i sort of committed myself to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">um finding finding somewhere else where</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">i could start to cultivate wisdom and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">took up</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">tai chi chuan and uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">the past meditation and contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">and related practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">and i started to practice these very</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">deeply and they were ha</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">was just having a profound</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">transformation on me</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">and um and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">you know i i there&#39;s overlap i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">presenting it like it&#39;s a nice clean</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">sequence but</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s muddied and overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">but i&#39;m sort of i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">cleaning it up for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">narrative um</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">and so i started to pursue that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">and then i realized that there was a new</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">discipline that was starting to talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">mind body and mind really right and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">at least in ways that uh i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">saying as you know this interest i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">having in wisdom was at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">closer to it than academic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">that was cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">so i decided to take it up and as i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">taking it up</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">i started to get more and more into it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">but cognitive science was itself going</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:04.960" style="s2">through a change</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">what was starting to happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.960" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">cognitive science and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">very close to it cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">were starting to come around</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">where they were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">consciousness and altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:19.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">and uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.760" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">rationality and then very soon wisdom uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">the book on wisdom came out in 1990 uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">edited by</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">robert sternberg so all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">all these topics that i was learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">about where i was cultivating wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">were now in cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">cognitive psychology so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">those two just came together for me and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">they started reinforcing each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">and then it just became</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">uh it went from something i was studying</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">to a vocation i had a sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">called to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">because of that convergence and the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">it seemed such of a kairos it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">resonate with my students</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">and then seems to start and then that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">sense of resonating with the culture at</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">uh started to grow on me um and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">that&#39;s how it happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">wow cool thank you very much i really</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">i uh one last thing i&#39;d like to share</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">with you is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">i know you probably heard this a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">the agape</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">um uh section in your lecture</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">that really blew me away i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">heard anyone articulate it so perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">and i really enjoyed your lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">the history was very fascinating i never</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">finished college so</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">it was it was probably the best uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">tallest course i could take online</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">to learn all of that from you so thank</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">you very much for your work and thank</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">you for sharing your story with us</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">well thank you for saying that um that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.520" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">episode on agape i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">several episodes in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">in the series that touched me very</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">um but that episode touches me maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">which is and i i i care a lot about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">not just because i think agape is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">so the the the the shareable reason the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">reason i can share with other people is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">i think agape</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">is tremendously important and i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">lots of arguments about why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">but for me uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to be presumptuous uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">anybody&#39;s religious orientation or</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">affiliation i always try to be very</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">respectful of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">for me and i&#39;m just speaking for me on</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">um that was a way in which i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">it was a culmination of a long</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">process of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.359" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">reappreciate jesus of nazareth</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">as for me a sage figure um</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">and to make to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">to recover from my religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">past something of the man</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">and his teaching and so that was for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">also a personally healing episode</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">wow well thank you for sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">that&#39;s very insightful and it took</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">years for you to figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">so thank you for saying that and thank</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">talking you talked about how you started</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:43.359" style="s2">your ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">john maybe you could just expand on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">the importance of an ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">what&#39;s going on now in the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">course which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">expanded beyond meditation to to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">and uh maybe maybe tell us a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">thank you thank you for the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:08.640" style="s2">to do so i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">um so yeah i mean i was as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">to valerie i was taught in ecology</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:14.040" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">and it took me quite a while to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.040" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">retrospectively understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">uh the pedagogical profundity of that um</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">how it afforded the transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">then the cognitive science i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">learning about cognitive complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">cognitive complexification and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">exactation</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">and cognitive flexibility just all</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">converge with that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">um so the idea of an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">practices is that any psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:44.680" style="s2">um has you know strength and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">and what you want to do each</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.680" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">is in some sense um affording you some</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">capacity for self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">like mindfulness self-correction of</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">attention for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">um but but that can be undermined by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">that psychotechnology uh can to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">some degree also be a source of bias</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">misdirection etc um and so you want uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">uh psychotechnological practices uh to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">be put into opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">um so at a higher you&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">higher order</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">a more comprehensive form of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">self-correction so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">one of the ones they offer for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">is you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">mindfulness practices um</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">tend to afford insight and they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">reduce your inferential processing</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">they tend to increase the insight</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">machinery and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good thing the problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">with the insight machinery is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">also the same machinery</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">by which you jump to conclusions and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">you you give in more quickly to your</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">intuitions and so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">that needs to be counter balanced with</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">things like active open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">which tend to dampen down that machinery</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">increase and foreground the inferential</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:11.200" style="s2">the problem with pure active</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">open-mindedness is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">is it doesn&#39;t it can get you into a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">rigidity a locking in of your framing</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">uh an inability to afford insight and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">they have respective strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">weaknesses and you need to have them</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">together within mindfulness you need</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">meditative practices</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">uh that are designed to get you to step</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">back and reflect on the patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">processes of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">and they need to be counterbalanced with</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">that get you to look through that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">reframing and see if you can realize</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">deeper patterns</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">um in the world so what you have is you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">have that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">like an ecology you have these nested</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">relationships at different scales</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">in which things need to be put into</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">so they counter balance and mutually</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:58.640" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">and constrain each other so</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.640" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">at a very high level what we&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">the sangha so within</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">the thing and we were already pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">pursuing that uh that sengo is what i</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">refer to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the community that has built up</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">around morning meditation class</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.680" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">so i taught people uh you know the past</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">meditation and then i taught them a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">uh which is uh uh meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">and then i taught them how to put them</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">together into a kind of opponent</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:29.839" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">that actually um exacts into a higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.839" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">state uh prajna</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">uh but i also taught them how to balance</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">all these</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">sitted non-moving forms of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">with moving practices</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">and so you can see that what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">is the complexification of multi-scaled</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:51.760" style="s2">um opponent processing and ecology but</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">all of those things are really centered</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">on various aspects of mindfulness and if</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">you remember what i said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">the problem with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">is uh they need to be counterbalanced</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">uh by other kinds of practices um</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">like aom and active open mindedness is</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">basically drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">stoicism and stoicism is one</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">of the wisdom traditions uh within</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">the west we&#39;re making use of a book</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.880" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">so we have these eastern these these</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.880" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">an ecology of practices drawn from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">you know drawn from buddhism vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">meta</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">drawn from taoism tai chi chi kung uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">uh each one janjung and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">we&#39;re now going through the western uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">um all of so if right</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">you know the buddha is sort of a an</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">exemplary figure for the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">socrates is the exemplary figure from</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:55.440" style="s2">the western traditions</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">and we&#39;re actually going through you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.440" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">know uh in</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">uh we&#39;re going through mcclellan&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">the wisdom of hypatia which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">a course</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">where primary school is uh epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">and the epicurean practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">and then you graduate from that into</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:14.079" style="s2">high school where you learn the stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">and the stoic practices that i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.079" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">earlier and then you graduate from that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">into the neoplatonic practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">and so you get the right so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">of you go primary school to high school</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.839" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">sort of university level then</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">and and each one&#39;s for each one built it</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">compensates and corrects and builds and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">deepens it complexifies</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">and so what you end up with is a rich</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">ecology of practices drawn from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">and i i i agree with uh arthur versus</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">lewis that neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">is the sort of cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">historical grammar of western</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">neoplatonism is how you get you know it</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">christian mysticism that&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.480" style="s2">uh islamic mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">and sufism um it&#39;s how you get things</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.480" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">like kabbalah and judaism</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">etc um and and um</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">of course it was first for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">uh either publicly or under persecution</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">in hiding it was also just itself an</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:23.760" style="s2">independent spiritual tradition</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">um and so uh the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.760" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">to give people that huge</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">uh western stream ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:34.799" style="s2">and then at the very a very high level</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">you have this opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.799" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">uh between the eastern and western</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">orientations</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">and so you get a very high level um</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.319" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">uh capacity for self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:51.760" style="s2">for aspiration at the same time you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">a rich reservoir of practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.760" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">that allow for a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">while also giving people shared</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:04.319" style="s2">processes shared language uh shared way</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">of communicating and communing together</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.319" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">and i think this is perhaps very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">for a pluralistic world going through uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">rapid uh historical socioeconomic and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">cultural change</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">brett was that okay did that sort of do</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">it yeah</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">probably two&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">um and you know and then work your way</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">through but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">but then um as you&#39;re doing that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.119" style="s2">could meet in and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">start you know where we are in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.119" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of resources by which</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">people and lots of people have done this</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">uh we try to pace things up they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:18.960" style="s2">able to they&#39;ve started at all different</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">and been able to catch up and integrate</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:26.079" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think that would preclude</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">people at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.079" end="01:01:29.280" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been meeting at 9 30 in the</p>

<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">place on the discord</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">or coordinated through the discord uh on</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">what do you call a philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">fellowship yeah it&#39;s philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">contemplative companionship</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the one of the core</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">practices core</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">group practices um that i think is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">inspired by epicureanism uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">it would lead to belong to what i would</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">call extended epicureanism yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.680" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">and so can you just talk really briefly</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.079" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">what what that we will be dividing into</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:17.200" style="s2">groups and then what what we&#39;d be doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.200" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">um so what yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:24.559" style="s2">one thing is to recommend people check</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">out um</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.559" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">meditating with john verveinke the class</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">i gave on friday</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">the class i gave today um if they wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:33.599" style="s2">to get a quick</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">a little bit more sorry a little less</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.599" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">quick a little bit longer</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">like more extensive presentation but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.799" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">basic idea is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.319" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">um learning a way</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">of reading and speaking</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s the wrong word to erase</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">what i just said</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">i was trying to i was building a</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">contrast in my mind and then i blurted</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">out the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">very often we we think about things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">we speak about them and we speak</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">to people and and and that&#39;s very useful</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">for all kinds of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">what you wanted to learn to do is</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">not to about a text but learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">think through it</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:15.359" style="s2">uh uh you know some short philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.359" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">as a way of picking up the way that</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">thought like how plato thought or how</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:24.400" style="s2">spinoza thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">because a good way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.400" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">this is most</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">of our deepest aspirational learning and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">transformation comes from role modeling</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">i mean you probably heard this uh i</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">heard it a lot growing up as a kid</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">you know kids pay a lot more attention</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">to what you do than what you say</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">uh because they imitate you they try and</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">take they try to see things the way you</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">see them</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">and they try and that&#39;s how they work</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">whereas they pay</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">precious little especially in the teen</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">years to what you say</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">so the child is to the adult the adult</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">is to the sage you want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:58.480" style="s2">read a text together you want to try and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.480" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">that person like plato&#39;s perspective or</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">spinoza perspective</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">not because you agree with it but also</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree with it</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:09.039" style="s2">don&#39;t think at it and don&#39;t speak to</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">people try to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.039" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">to collectively give voice to it uh so</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">that you can more and more</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">start to sense what it would be like</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">to see the world in a platonic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">all around</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">right and see yourself and others in</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.880" style="s2">that in a platonic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">or a spinozistic fashion or a stoic</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.880" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">um or you know a buddhist fashion</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:37.599" style="s2">and and so the idea there is is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">collectively uh come into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.599" end="01:04:40.720" style="s2">contemplative place where you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">through the text</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.720" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">and you&#39;re looking through what you say</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">together through in both meanings of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:53.039" style="s2">uh by means of and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">so that who can role model in a profound</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.039" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">way sage&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:03.000" style="s2">way of seeing and being and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s to cultivate a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.000" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">companionship together</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:13.839" style="s2">a fellowship around practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">that has us coming into</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.839" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">consonance and coherence with these</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">powerful visions of the depths</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">of what human beings can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">in the depths of how the world can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">disclosed to them</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s the the the the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">now there&#39;s a bunch of i mean that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">sounds very abstract</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s actually some there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">specific uh procedures and sequences of</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">procedures that i&#39;ve taught that people</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">can use to actually do what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.160" end="01:05:51.760" style="s2">and i see this as a seed practice one of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:52.960" style="s2">the things you do in oncology practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.760" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">is you layer them</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.960" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve had a lot of feedback recently uh i</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">got some excellent feedback from nick</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">winkelmann</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">um on this very point um really</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">brilliant guy his language of coaching</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">really important book</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">um and he said you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">he said to me you know you i realize</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">that you have all these things and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">they layer and converge together</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">and that happens over time and so what i</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:19.599" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.480" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">by an ecology of practices is it should</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.599" end="01:06:23.760" style="s2">also layer</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">uh so i think uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">that philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:30.799" style="s2">companionships</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">train and are seed practices uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.799" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">for a neoplatonic practice down the road</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">of dialectic which i hope to also</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:40.400" style="s2">um uh i i guess you as you probably know</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">brett i&#39;m doing a lot of work on that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.400" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">with a lot of people to try and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:46.480" style="s2">sort of uh reinvent you that so uh i</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:48.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.480" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">all of these are important because we</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.799" end="01:06:54.319" style="s2">have lost</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">have lost dialectic and which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.319" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">a process of opponent processing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">self-correcting</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">we have lost it in debate which has</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">almost completely zero sum and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:07.119" style="s2">adversarial and</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">we are we we have lost communing</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">together that&#39;s what i&#39;m describing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:12.880" style="s2">we have reduced it merely to</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.039" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">which we have then reduced to simply</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.039" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">sending signal</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">and trying to make sure that our signal</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.400" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">uh gets to where we want it to go to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">what we want it to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">and that is um not</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">conducive to wisdom and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:32.240" style="s2">conducive</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">to giving people the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.240" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">that open them up to overcoming</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">and to enhancing the connectedness to</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">themselves to each other into world</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">that is generative of increased meaning</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">in life</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.160" style="s2">so that that&#39;s why there are there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">much hunger</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.160" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">for these forms of dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">that are centered on communing</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">the logos as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">communicating within debate</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i would say about that so</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">much and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.119" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">uh some of you guys listening will want</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:12.400" style="s2">to join us as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:12.400" style="s2">so mark you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">yeah sorry about that um</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">hey john um i&#39;m going to return your</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">favor</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">from uh the last time we talked and sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">of ask you what what</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">actually is maybe a bit unfair and is</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.520" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">indecent question in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:36.400" style="s2">for which i&#39;ll i&#39;ll apologize in advance</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.400" end="01:08:39.520" style="s2">feel free to skip any of the difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.319" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">parts of this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.520" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">uh three-part thing that i&#39;m i think i</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">can outline</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">so i&#39;m having a uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">i&#39;m literally struggling over the topic</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:56.640" style="s2">of addiction and</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:59.040" style="s2">um i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.640" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">sort of in three aspects like i see sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.040" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">of two definitions of addiction right</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">anything that you&#39;re doing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">getting in the way of other things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">you should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">right and then i sort of realized rather</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:11.839" style="s2">recently actually that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">a poor model some people are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.839" end="01:09:14.480" style="s2">slaves to their addiction even though</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.480" end="01:09:18.080" style="s2">or not apparently getting in the way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:20.960" style="s2">anything and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.080" end="01:09:22.719" style="s2">right there&#39;s self-deception so you</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.960" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">can&#39;t use the first definition because</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.719" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">if there&#39;s self-deception you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:27.600" style="s2">you won&#39;t even notice uh that you that</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">you have that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.600" end="01:09:31.600" style="s2">addiction and that and then i you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.600" end="01:09:38.560" style="s2">like that fits into the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">in some important way that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.560" end="01:09:41.759" style="s2">that i&#39;m not i&#39;m not sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:43.359" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.759" end="01:09:45.040" style="s2">and and you know i don&#39;t know what your</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.359" end="01:09:47.679" style="s2">thoughts are around that so that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.040" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">that i think you can you know address</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">easily</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">clarification when you said that do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">mean that</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">poor definition of addiction</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:09:59.040" style="s2">addiction itself is it okay so i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:01.520" style="s2">know which this was sorry</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.040" end="01:10:03.120" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s because i&#39;m my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.520" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">are unclear on this and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.120" end="01:10:05.679" style="s2">difficult topic for me for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.679" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">so yeah how does addiction fit into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">meaning crisis which is what i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">down i don&#39;t know why i can&#39;t read today</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">uh and then and then you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">more on the you know more to the point</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:18.080" style="s2">and maybe you shouldn&#39;t even touch this</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">and and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.080" end="01:10:22.159" style="s2">you know again i apologize what other</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">practices like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.159" end="01:10:26.159" style="s2">help release ourselves from addiction</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">like what what are the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.159" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">can do to even</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">practices that we can engage in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:33.679" style="s2">maybe we find addictions that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:36.719" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.679" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">existed in some sense so that those are</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">the sort of the three layers that i that</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">i want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">you know and feel free to riff on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:45.760" style="s2">definitions too because</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">like i i have never given this enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.760" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">right and so i&#39;m sort of coming out this</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:51.199" style="s2">new in in some sense which is strange to</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:53.679" style="s2">me but</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">yeah anything you could go on on riff on</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.679" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">that topic would be great</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:59.280" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s great mark um so first</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.600" end="01:11:01.760" style="s2">of all an important caveat</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.280" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">this is something this is a part of my</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.760" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">that is still i&#39;m still a work in</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:07.920" style="s2">progress um</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">and maybe i don&#39;t mean that in the sorry</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.920" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">everything i&#39;m doing is still a work in</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:12.719" style="s2">progress what i mean by that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not too i&#39;m not at a place where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.719" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">completely satisfied</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">uh you know presenting it um</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.520" end="01:11:23.920" style="s2">in any kind of uh recommended manner uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:23.920" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">but i i want to hmm but i&#39;m going to i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:31.120" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:34.159" style="s2">let&#39;s do so given that caveat and given</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.120" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">that what i i&#39;m saying is not meant to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.159" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">uh be anything other than</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.520" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">preliminary why do i why do i say that</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">because as i</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:44.560" style="s2">as i did explicitly arguing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">confident about this first point the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.560" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">model of addiction</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">in our culture is going through a major</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">and you&#39;re correct mark um so we had an</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">old model which was uh the disease model</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">and then the criteria for establishing</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">that were exactly</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:07.199" style="s2">uh the ones that you gave uh which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">you know uh well how do we know when</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.199" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">someone is diseased well</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">they&#39;re they they are incapable of</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.239" style="s2">functioning normally</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:15.280" style="s2">and they therefore need our help uh so</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.239" end="01:12:18.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.280" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">right and and of course the degree of</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.080" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">loss of functionality</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:23.440" style="s2">like a cold we we maybe allow people a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">day off</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.440" end="01:12:26.960" style="s2">uh but some diseases uh you know like</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:29.760" style="s2">hiv</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.960" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">requires significant intervention um and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.760" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">therefore you can put addictions on</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:35.679" style="s2">something analogous the disease scale</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">and then you measure them by how</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.679" end="01:12:39.840" style="s2">dysfunctional people&#39;s lives get</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">and and then what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.840" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">it when people&#39;s lives are dis</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">functional in three domains um you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:48.880" style="s2">work um and relationship and basic</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.880" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">self-care um that&#39;s when a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">addicted</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">so and and that hap okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:12:58.960" style="s2">so that diagnostic right those</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.679" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">diagnostic criteria</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.960" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">they have they had value they they did</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:05.600" style="s2">help uh to</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">zero in on people that needed help um</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.600" end="01:13:09.280" style="s2">but they were based on a model the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">disease model</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.280" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">that has been increasingly undermined</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:20.000" style="s2">uh by a lot of empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">um and by a lot of good theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:23.760" style="s2">argumentation</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">and uh you know that&#39;s where and at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.760" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">for and i&#39;ve seen many people are doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:28.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.080" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">the person that who&#39;s taught me the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.159" end="01:13:31.120" style="s2">on this um</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">and who&#39;s at the forefront of this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.120" end="01:13:35.440" style="s2">mark lewis and his notion</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">uh that addiction is a learned behavior</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.440" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">it&#39;s reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">and as i&#39;ve mentioned before i i the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:43.280" style="s2">idea i got of</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:45.120" style="s2">understanding anagage as reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:48.320" style="s2">opening and the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.120" end="01:13:51.280" style="s2">of addiction um came up in</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">a dialogue i was having with mark lewis</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.280" end="01:13:57.520" style="s2">then that leads me to a point</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.920" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">that that you i think we&#39;re bringing up</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.520" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:05.040" style="s2">addictions if we see addiction as</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">right moving in the direction</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.040" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">predominantly because we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.040" end="01:14:09.920" style="s2">probabilistically we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">dispositionally we&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.920" end="01:14:13.920" style="s2">every moment of your life</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">if we say that people are predominantly</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.920" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">moving in reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">uh that should be thought of is in some</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">way addictive</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">and the cap if they&#39;re moving uh away</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">from that reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:27.600" style="s2">um that that&#39;s that&#39;s that is in some</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:29.600" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.600" end="01:14:30.800" style="s2">the ultimate therapeutic kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.600" end="01:14:33.040" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.800" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">but we should then broaden the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.040" end="01:14:37.199" style="s2">addiction</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">uh much more comprehensively and this</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.199" end="01:14:40.560" style="s2">this goes into what you talked about uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">let me give you an example what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">i think uh you know eric fromm&#39;s modal</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">confusion in which people get</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">locked into um a vicious cycle of</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.239" end="01:14:51.280" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing because they get</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:53.920" style="s2">locked into the having mode</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.280" end="01:14:55.920" style="s2">they lose access to the being mode they</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.920" end="01:14:57.199" style="s2">can function and this is part of fraum&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.920" end="01:14:58.560" style="s2">argument tonight this is i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.199" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">steal man your point</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.560" end="01:15:03.520" style="s2">they can function in in our society</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">and you know and promise point is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.520" end="01:15:07.920" style="s2">because our society is</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:10.080" style="s2">is in some major ways insane and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.920" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2">society is actually driving that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.080" end="01:15:14.560" style="s2">modal confusion and so although they are</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">locked into reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.560" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">they aren&#39;t meeting the sort of standard</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:20.560" style="s2">criteria</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">given by the society of being functional</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.560" end="01:15:25.360" style="s2">they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:27.679" style="s2">successful in their right in in their</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.360" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">in their in their careers and their you</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:31.600" style="s2">know the fact that they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.360" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">several marriages maybe that&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.600" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">success it means that</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:37.360" style="s2">they sort of are constantly trading up</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:40.560" style="s2">and all the kinds of framing critiques</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.360" end="01:15:42.880" style="s2">so the point is when you use the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.560" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">standard criteria based on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.880" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">really inadequate model of addiction you</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:49.760" style="s2">too narrow a scope of which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.239" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">looking for addiction</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">and i was going to say this when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:55.920" style="s2">when you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.840" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">um that that the the sort of normal</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.920" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">criteria even when people were using</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">that criteria</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">those criteria they knew it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">inadequate because</p>

<p begin="01:16:13.120" end="01:16:16.880" style="s2">standard markers of addiction but</p>

<p begin="01:16:30.719" end="01:16:38.719" style="s2">um the the individualistic nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:41.600" style="s2">of that criteria is also misrepresenting</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.719" end="01:16:43.840" style="s2">so when we talk about addiction and we</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.600" end="01:16:44.880" style="s2">move to this kind of more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.840" end="01:16:48.920" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.880" end="01:16:52.480" style="s2">we have to look at how</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.920" end="01:16:55.760" style="s2">self-deception can be masked not only</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.480" end="01:16:58.640" style="s2">by internal mechanisms like bias</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.760" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">and parasitic processing but also by</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.640" end="01:17:03.400" style="s2">external conditions</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammars um</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.400" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:11.280" style="s2">uh institutions and structures um</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:11.679" style="s2">that can prevent people from getting out</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.280" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.679" end="01:17:18.159" style="s2">uh the kinds of reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.360" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">that nevertheless is dysfunctional in</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.159" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">way like</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:24.159" style="s2">notice how peop many people who would be</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">satisfying standard</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:27.600" style="s2">uh criteria for not being addicted but</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:29.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.600" end="01:17:31.440" style="s2">their reciprocal narrowing is starving</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.920" end="01:17:33.920" style="s2">them into a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.440" end="01:17:35.600" style="s2">zombie version of the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.920" end="01:17:38.560" style="s2">they&#39;re totally unaware of it but</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.600" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s there they lack</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.560" end="01:17:42.239" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">and therefore they have a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.239" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">brittleness at the level of mental</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">health um in terms of moral aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:51.840" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:55.120" style="s2">so i think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.840" end="01:17:58.640" style="s2">we need to more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.120" end="01:18:00.320" style="s2">uh think about</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.640" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">addiction in terms of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.320" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:06.480" style="s2">we need to make central self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:09.440" style="s2">and how self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.480" end="01:18:10.560" style="s2">bleeds out into things that were not</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.440" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">considered</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.560" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">medically forms of addiction and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">that has to do not only with internal</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.280" end="01:18:21.600" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.800" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">but internal external environments the</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.600" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">agent arena relationship</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:28.400" style="s2">of course is paramount in my mind and</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:31.920" style="s2">what that means to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.400" end="01:18:34.640" style="s2">is that i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.920" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">obviously people should sorry i want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.640" end="01:18:38.840" style="s2">i want to make this really clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:40.159" style="s2">people i mean people still should be</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.840" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">um you know therapeutic interventions</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:47.040" style="s2">both individual</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.840" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">and group therapies uh they should</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.040" end="01:18:50.400" style="s2">and they should pursue therapies that</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:53.840" style="s2">are increasingly more</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.400" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">embodied than just sort of standard cbt</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.840" end="01:18:58.400" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:19:00.400" style="s2">um but i think we have we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.400" end="01:19:02.800" style="s2">the realization</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.400" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">this is where again i feel most</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">incomplete in what i&#39;m saying in most</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:07.280" style="s2">tenuous but we&#39;re coming to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">realization that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.280" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">uh addictions not the way i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.480" style="s2">more broadly construed them and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:18.080" style="s2">portrayed them um</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.480" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">they require a sacred response</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.080" end="01:19:23.280" style="s2">and you say that&#39;s crazy well is it uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:25.040" style="s2">we know that something that looks a lot</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.280" end="01:19:28.800" style="s2">like sacredness</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.040" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">uh which is you know a mixture of</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.800" end="01:19:33.760" style="s2">uh you know some a psychedelic to</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">enhance cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.760" end="01:19:39.520" style="s2">and then a ritual narrative uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:41.600" style="s2">situation like therapy that combination</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.520" end="01:19:43.520" style="s2">is way more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:45.199" style="s2">dealing with depression and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.520" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">about depression is it doesn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.199" end="01:19:49.520" style="s2">under our standard definitions</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:51.760" style="s2">of addiction but man does it ever fall</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.520" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">under uh reciprocal narrowing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.760" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:57.120" style="s2">and having environmental factors as well</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:20:00.400" style="s2">as internal factors</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.120" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">and so opening up the idea</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.400" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">that we need a sacred dimension</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">in the response to a lot of addiction</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:11.600" style="s2">i think is important now many of you are</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">saying and and this is a good point</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.600" end="01:20:15.600" style="s2">i&#39;m acknowledging it well that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">spiritual dimension has always been</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.600" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">present you know you know with</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.280" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">alcoholics anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:23.040" style="s2">or you know there&#39;s a buddhist version</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">uh for alcoholics anonymous that makes</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.040" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">use of the eightfold path rather than</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:28.719" style="s2">a christian framework it&#39;s actually by</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:30.239" style="s2">the way um empirically seems to be more</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.719" end="01:20:31.679" style="s2">successful than a.a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.239" end="01:20:32.960" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know what that says it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.679" end="01:20:34.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say that buddhism is more true</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:35.520" style="s2">than christianity</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.000" end="01:20:37.920" style="s2">or anything ridiculous about that it</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.520" end="01:20:38.400" style="s2">points to the point i&#39;m trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.920" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.400" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">yeah but we we we could get better at</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:44.480" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.159" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">the the sacredness and we could do</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.480" end="01:20:48.080" style="s2">better at implementing it and</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">integrating it and using it</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.080" end="01:20:54.400" style="s2">in how we respond to individual</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:55.280" style="s2">addiction but we also would then turn it</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.400" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">outward</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.280" end="01:20:59.120" style="s2">and need to in a coordinated fashion use</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.960" style="s2">it to respond</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.120" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">to collective cultural addictions</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.960" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">so um that&#39;s nowhere near enough mark</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:11.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s inadequate in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:14.080" style="s2">ways there&#39;s lots of lacuna what i said</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.920" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">but that&#39;s where my thinking is at right</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.080" end="01:21:19.199" style="s2">now about that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:19.840" style="s2">wow that was yeah that was as always</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.199" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.840" end="01:21:24.159" style="s2">that was fantastic that was a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">uh comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:27.520" style="s2">uh we&#39;ll say than i thought and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:29.360" style="s2">just quickly</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.520" end="01:21:30.960" style="s2">is there anything you think in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.360" end="01:21:32.480" style="s2">practices i mean i didn&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.960" end="01:21:34.400" style="s2">about the eightfold path and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.480" end="01:21:35.760" style="s2">aaa you know because a i always thought</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.400" end="01:21:37.280" style="s2">was the best but</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.760" end="01:21:38.800" style="s2">um is there anything in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.280" end="01:21:40.639" style="s2">practices to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.800" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">overcome the self-deception about say</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:44.159" style="s2">whether or not we&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">because to your point yeah it&#39;s an it</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.159" end="01:21:47.520" style="s2">looks like an addiction</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.440" style="s2">or or and then and then treatment is</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.520" end="01:21:50.960" style="s2">there you know other than just like</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.440" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">sacredness is there something</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.960" end="01:21:54.400" style="s2">you can point to specifically maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">maybe as part of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.400" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">like the meditation ecology practices</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:21:58.719" style="s2">series that you&#39;re that you&#39;re teaching</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:02.159" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.719" end="01:22:06.719" style="s2">i do think i do think um i do think</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.159" end="01:22:10.000" style="s2">um a richly layered ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.719" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">um that is oriented both internally and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.000" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">externally like we&#39;re trying to do in</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">the sangha</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">um has the highest plausibility</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">uh and probability uh plausibility in</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:22.719" style="s2">the sense in terms of its</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">intelligibility and justification</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.080" end="01:22:29.760" style="s2">for doing what you said getting people</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.880" end="01:22:32.960" style="s2">to realize</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.760" end="01:22:35.440" style="s2">in fact um so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.960" end="01:22:36.239" style="s2">again i don&#39;t have scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:39.520" style="s2">but i have</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.239" end="01:22:42.560" style="s2">too close to two decades</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.520" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">of anecdotal evidence that this is often</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.560" end="01:22:45.440" style="s2">what happens when people enter these</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.440" end="01:22:50.560" style="s2">pathways they come in for one reason</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:51.600" style="s2">people here let me like an extended</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.560" end="01:22:53.840" style="s2">example i want to meditate because i</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.600" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">want to relax and get rid of stress</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.840" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">and as they do this they start to see</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">forms of self-deception that they were</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.040" end="01:23:02.880" style="s2">not aware of</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.320" end="01:23:04.560" style="s2">that were are sort of underlying and</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.880" end="01:23:06.480" style="s2">causing but deeper than</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.560" end="01:23:08.560" style="s2">the stress factors and then they start</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.480" end="01:23:10.800" style="s2">to wake up to that and they do that</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.560" end="01:23:12.080" style="s2">because of the practices but you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.800" end="01:23:13.679" style="s2">the buddha the dharma that&#39;s saying it</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">they do it because of the practices</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.679" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">uh they do it because they get a new</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.760" end="01:23:19.440" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">by which they can articulate and reflect</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.440" end="01:23:22.000" style="s2">and they get it because of a sangha they</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:23.520" style="s2">get it because of</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:26.159" style="s2">you know groups of people through which</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.520" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">they can self-transcend and self-correct</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.159" end="01:23:32.080" style="s2">so i think yeah that has um the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">uh plausibility and probability of</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.080" end="01:23:35.120" style="s2">helping people awaken to forms of</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:37.840" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:41.920" style="s2">that are so self-masking that people</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.840" end="01:23:41.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t not even initially aware of them</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.280" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">that&#39;s great thanks john i i appreciate</p>
