<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">and how did the mother come in to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">through struggle and that struggle</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">led to birth and that birth led to</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">i think that people often forget about</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">i&#39;d love to do this panel and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">it kind of took on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">yeah absolutely i feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">something else as well i mean rachel</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">like i was following rachel the great</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">rachel haywire</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">um before when i was just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">um about a year ago and we met in new</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">york city</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">and there was just like explosions</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">of like synergy and synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been working on projects ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">since and i think that that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">like the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this individual right</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">we are individuals we are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">separated from one another as as</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">as women as philosopher queens um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">you know finding rachel was this moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">of like the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">building a tribe right this like moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">of a dyad</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">forming uh where we could begin to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">explore ideas together and also appear</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">in in public which i think is also part</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">of what&#39;s interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">into the manifesto i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">something that rachel brings</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">that&#39;s really unique is this drive to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">expose</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">to expose ideas um which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">inherently connected to the willingness</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">to take risks</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">the willingness to stand for what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">believe in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">and to go out there and piss people off</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">which is of course another</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">aspect of going against uh the grain</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">of conformity of mimesis which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">another aspect of the manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">is pointing out the memetic aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">the groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">that have been emerging around women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">rights or women&#39;s interests</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">um the kind of matriarchies that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">forming are kind of gathering around</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">certain polarities in terms of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">these like as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">as you describe like hashtags right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">we have like this kind of trad wife</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">uh we also have this like social justice</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">thing both groups have conservative</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">right where there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">reactionary like we don&#39;t want to stare</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">at the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to face the disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">aspects of not only ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">but also what it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">to face the world today what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">uh genuine real issues of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">misogyny and sexism but also to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">accept what men have done for the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">i mean i think that this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">things that uh really drew me to camille</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">paglia when she like opens her book and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">you know if civilization had been left</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">to women we&#39;d all be living in grass</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">huts</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">and i think that starting there is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">this brilliant confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">of the differences between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">and the fact that there is this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:57.279" style="s2">between these</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">these these forms these two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.279" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">forms</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">that are distinct and have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">different polarities that they embody</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">which is also why</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">even speaking about the feminine or</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">speaking about the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">has legitimacy um where</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">that that dimorphism is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">embodying principles that exist not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">merely within biology but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">ideas of like chaos versus order</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">um but i think the other thing is not to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">be reactionary against</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">the concept of the androgen just because</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">there are people in the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">world who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">emphasizing trans issues over the issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">these two polarities right so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">also speak about the androgen</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">and the different aspects of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">to be androgynous</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">um the androgynous aspect that is about</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">becoming adult becoming a synthesis um</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">and the androgynous aspect that is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">regression or an infantilization which</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">camille paglia really</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">lays out uh very well in her book sexual</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">personae in terms of what a decadent</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">androgen um emerges as so</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">all of these things have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">mulling around between rachel and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">over the over almost a year that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">known each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">and i think you know her bringing forth</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">this manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">kind of just like pierced into the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">discourse or the currents</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">um in order to get both of us to just</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">begin</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">to work together um begin to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">form a dyad</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">and try and basically through</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">example attract other women to what</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">um rather than kind of having this you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">know</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">mean chasing</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">after somebody it&#39;s always the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">idea if you notice but none of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">recruitment groups are</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">effective on none of these campaigns to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">get people</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">to vote for a certain thing or being</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">very well received</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">now during the election you can see</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">angrily tweeting about how they&#39;re sick</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">of getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">calls about who to vote for um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">because we don&#39;t like things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">are trying too hard um and i say</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">in the manifesto i&#39;m going to quote</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">another part</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">that which we do not reveal becomes that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">which the world desires</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s the hidden element what we keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">that becomes the object of fixation</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">from the society from</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">from the other that which we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">there just aren&#39;t very many women who</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.520" style="s2">are participating in these things they</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">feel that they can because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">and people seem to forget that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s time for us to remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">sure i think it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">um why aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">more women um especially because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">know what i&#39;ve observed is that women</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">are into philosophy also tend to be into</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">intersectionality so women who are in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">the humanities</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">um they&#39;re often into queer theory and</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">yes kind of frankfurt school kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">know post-modernist post-structuralist</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s this intertwining with</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">activism um and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">while i think that you know there seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">to be a lot of momentum in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">the fact of it is there are more things</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">to think about than political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">um and i think particularly</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">as we are confronting the changes of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">our reality due to technological shifts</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">um we have to we have to get outside of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">frameworks that we&#39;ve inherited</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">particularly ones that have mass appeal</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about um</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">is a political ideology the anarch who</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">stands</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">outside of society and dares to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">for himself and typically himself</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">really i mean i think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">certain kinds of personality traits that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">you find clustered more often in men and</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">anti-social behavior is more often</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">a male trait and i think that you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">to say i don&#39;t care about assimilating</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">we are kind of given this task</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">i think to face you know what science</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">has unearthed what psychoanalysis is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">on earth what like the observation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">the 20th century and all of its horrors</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">have unearthed what birth control has</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">done for women</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">how women coming into the public sphere</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">has changed</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">social and political dynamics how</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">now we&#39;re dealing with mixed like co-ed</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">offices and how that kind of creates</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">between the sexes um and also</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">just the concept that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">feminism of a woman being essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">interiorly male with just the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">form of a man of a woman with with</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">breasts</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">and you know with the rounded body of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">woman and and to operate as if just this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">kind of cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:01.679" style="s2">male subject um which causes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">tension if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">how you that&#39;s not true if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">true and you&#39;re operating as if that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">then a lot of misery will come of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that as well um and then of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">the basic issues of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">envy and bitterness</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">and despair and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">jealousy and all of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">aspects of what it is to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">community and to see the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">other people have and to want them</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">but to not admit that you want them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">i think that&#39;s also something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">tearing apart communities of women</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">particularly because we we&#39;ve really and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">i think feminism has really</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">played a role in this um has pushed</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:51.600" style="s2">aside the role of the mother</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">and has made it something lesser</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.600" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">you know you hear a woman who gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">married at maybe 23 or something and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh what a what a pity why</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">would she do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">you know she has her whole life ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">her why would she get married</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">and have children and what if women want</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">like what if they want to get married</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">and have children</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">like how would that rub against them</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">that their society</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">is trying to make them conform to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">ideal</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">of being you know a an economic</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">subject so i think that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">are essential for women themselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">talking about in a very lucid way um</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">and so far i mean at least in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">where i&#39;ve seen people discussing these</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">things honestly</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">is not in communities of women it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">communities of men</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">because men are also in a in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">impoverishment</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">because women don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:49.919" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">men also don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.919" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">but you know they can at least see from</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">the outside</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">that there&#39;s something going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">women that&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">you know issues in terms of these these</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">polarities</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">in the world of ideas um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">women can bring that charge</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">um they can kind of bring the gestalt of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">their sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">into the sphere that is um</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">fiery with the discussion of what it</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">you know not merely to be a woman what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">it means but it means to be human what</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">it means to interact with technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">um what is the future you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">this very regressive kind of retro</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">um movement i think that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">but in a reaction to the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">um that the human psyche is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">going through in response to the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">of our technological environment</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">and to stand still</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">to purge all of this kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">mimetic desire and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">try to chart your own path forward um i</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">think is to kind of rise above</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">these like waves um of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">and to investigate principally</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m i feel very early i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">you know i i&#39;m young and like just</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">beginning to learn</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">about all of these things and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">not drawing conclusions too quickly</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">um is part of what feels important um</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">and to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">and to be open like you&#39;re saying rachel</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">and and to consider</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">ideas and to not recoil from them</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">because they&#39;re uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">um not to recoil from criticism because</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">it makes you feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like getting into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">zone</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">where you can be brave and you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">commit</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">to your own ideas but you can also face</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">the scrutiny of others um that&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is to be on the front</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">lines in terms of intellect</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">and intellectual battling um</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">and men seem to be doing this all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">time uh at least in these little</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s very good or not i</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">think is kind of dependent um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">definitely a lot of like circle jerking</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">i think that happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">but there are genuinely um</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">generative male communities of</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">and i think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">once the women find we&#39;ll find those</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">places we&#39;ll start bringing our own</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">thoughts to that world and um</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what will happen i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">like like we were talking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">like women being in this position um</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">at least within the kind of history that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">we are familiar with is it&#39;s novel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">novel and so there&#39;s still a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">investigate</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">and ask questions about and i want us to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">open ourselves to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">and uh see what we find</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">you know principally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">there there have been some attempts</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">you know um this is kind of an obscure</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">example um</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">but i was an industrial music producer</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">growing up so kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">goth electronic music i produced on my</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">laptop</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">and a few synthesizers and the genre</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">industrial which is kind of like an</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">offshoot of goth and punk um with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">cyberpunk element um it&#39;s very masculine</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">the music was masculine and the outfits</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">were masculine</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">like big stompy boots you know and like</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">very militant post-apocalyptic gear</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">you know um on the dance floor and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">had a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">masculine element um but there were some</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">women in the scene too and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">we loved the music all the same and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">started to make our own music</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">um and i formed a record label for women</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">in the goth industrial scene</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">women in the darker subcultures you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">i formed</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">an alliance you know um the vanguard</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">if you will um and i think that many</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">things like this have occurred</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">in the past but maybe they they just</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">don&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">really get uh recognition um i remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">i read a book about female futurists</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">you know most people only know male</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">futurist and you know the future is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">manifesto it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">misogynistic so you know women are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">dissuaded from like even getting into</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">futurism like at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">like period um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">so so that there&#39;s a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">women just feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">like is forbidden and off the table</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">feel like anything should be for them</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">like we need to get to the inner core</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">of the spirit of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">dionysus this occupation</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">of our souls our bodies our minds</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">the universe life the world how how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">we interact</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">with the apollo what happens when we</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">become the apollonian what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">we become the matriarchs</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">what happens when society is flipped</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">upside down</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">when we don&#39;t know what gender is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">what do we do then we carry</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">on a torch of philosopher queens</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">we carry on a torch of self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">without limitation we</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">carry on a torch of the divinity</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">of the self which is not strictly</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">feminine or</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">strictly masculine it is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">androgynous</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">like alexander var talks about he says</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">androgyny</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">is close to shamanism perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">philosopher queens are channeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">something shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">we are between worlds we</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">are bridges between the feminine and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">occupying both realms and exploring</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">each gender yet defining as</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">female defining as queens defining as</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.599" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">who are seeking knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">cool does that seem like a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">jump in or</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">i thought that was brilliant yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">thought that was a brilliant conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">so women seeking knowledge yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:46.960" style="s2">thought that was a brilliant conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.960" end="00:41:51.760" style="s2">um i made a few notes here but</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of going to throw away my notes</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">and just say what</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">comes to my mind uh and maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">have a short conversation and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">open up everything to</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">the the few people here who are here</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">um i was thinking as you were talking i</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">thinking about how limited are our</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">personas</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:17.520" style="s2">are in this culture how we have such</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">cliche versions of everything um</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.520" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">and it occurs to me that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">this this boundaries that you you guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">are trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">like i was reading tyson yakapura&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">and he talked about how his</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">how in his indigenous village the women</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">were really tough and they got into</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">street fights and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">and the men were kind of sensitive and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">very very very soft and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">um you know and and it just occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">me that that we we</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of living in a time where</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">we&#39;re in this global culture where where</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">gender has become a prison of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">um and also i just wanted to i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">my own personal experience is that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">know in my in my youth</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">i i was i was a musician i played in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">bands and people in bands have long hair</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">they they kind of adore women like we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">worship</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">women on some level in our 20s men and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">they even try to dress like them</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">and and uh you know we see that in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">popular</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">culture and um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">later as i i became older i started</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">becoming interested in masculinity again</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">i didn&#39;t give a about you know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">that was before</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">um so it&#39;s interesting i wanna i i feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">like the culture has just flipped over</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">on its side or something where</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">where people are now looking for like uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">uh they&#39;ve been sort of shattered in</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">every direction and all they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">is cliche models of of what masculine</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">and feminine could be so</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going back to try to find a you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">know a more</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">deeper archetype does that make any</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">sense can can you riff off anything i</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">i said there</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">uh yeah no i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.960" style="s2">i mean it seems like this is a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.960" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">right where people seek outward guidance</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">for who they should ought to become</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">right i think um the fracturing of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">traditional roles</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">not to say that it isn&#39;t a burden</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">energetically expensive</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">to deal with that kind of attention but</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">this is not something that is merely an</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">issue for women</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">it seems like women may get</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">more kind of attention from multiple</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">directions i think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">rachel is pointing out something really</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">important that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">not only will men come after you but</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">difficult to stand against the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">um and that but that&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">if you have something to say i mean it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">mob right</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">goes after those who stand for</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">the future i mean the prophet right we</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">think of you know if you think about</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">right like the mob is what like</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s in that destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">the prophet that the future actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">comes to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">um and that playing around with those</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:04.040" style="s2">archetypes and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">to speak the truth is not some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.040" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">lackadaisical</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">like you know kind of fun thing that you</p>

<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">part of the issue</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">with what&#39;s going on today not only with</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">just like feminism</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">and the pressure on little girls to save</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">not every woman is motivated to do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.440" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">and if she thinks that she&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:03:59.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s how most people live right</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.680" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">they just it&#39;s careerism right they go</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:03.920" style="s2">you know and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:06.400" style="s2">drop the kid off at the daycare and so</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.400" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">some sympathy for traditional</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">conservative people who are saying</p>

<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:21.599" style="s2">um especially for mothers just as that</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">intimacy with the child is so</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.599" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">essential yeah it&#39;s essential for their</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">development it&#39;s also excruciatingly</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">painful</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">to become uh what is the the abject</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">you know to to be the thing that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">child has to reject</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">to become the thing that is that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:42.559" style="s2">were like as the child repulsed by</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">which is the which is the sacrifice of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.559" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">the mother the mother has to become that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">which the child revives</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">like reviles and in order for the child</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">either eroticize or become you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">phallus right</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">so this behavior of conflict you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">between these three principles you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">the father the mother and the infant</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">like there&#39;s tension as much as there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:07.920" style="s2">symbiosis</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">between all of those different aspects</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.920" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">of the family</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">and the mother plays this very critical</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:13.920" style="s2">role in the beginning of life and she</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">has to</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.920" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">accept that she will become the evil one</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">you know she will become the devouring</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">mother to the child because the child</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">must leave her and that transition is</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.240" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">painful</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">and in fact we&#39;re actually aided by our</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:32.240" style="s2">evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">in being given repulsion the child is</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.240" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">given repulsion</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">by their body to get them away from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">mother to take the risk to leap into the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">and leave her behind even though that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">painful</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">you you kind of delay experiencing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">pain of that because the repulsion</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">moves you to get away from her and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">have to endure that as a mother</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">like and and i think a lot of mothers</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">especially of this previous kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">the generation that raised me for</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">example did not let this happen</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">they wanted to be their children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">friends and they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">they were not satisfied with the idea</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">that they would become evil to their</p>

<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">and so they attempted to smother them</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:15.920" style="s2">and that is also part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">dealing with which is like</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">yeah well i think um what was considered</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.159" end="01:08:59.279" style="s2">like hysteria then</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">is um like kind of like people called</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.279" end="01:09:04.000" style="s2">every woman borderline now</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">like people called every woman hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.000" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">historical then</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">um and it&#39;s just like women who are</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:12.960" style="s2">going forward in a way that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:15.600" style="s2">considered to be like</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.960" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">proper you know i&#39;m not to say that</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.600" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">historian borderline don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">um but they&#39;re often like blanket terms</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">can i qualify that a little because i</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sound you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:27.759" style="s2">i think you know the freudian idea is</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">what hysteria is the emotional</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.759" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">uh you know um craziness and neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">is mental craziness right you know and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:37.679" style="s2">men i probably tend tend to more</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">ideation</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.679" end="01:09:41.040" style="s2">craziness and and women tend towards you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:43.120" style="s2">know the more physical</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.040" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">you know for obvious reason craziness i</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.120" end="01:09:46.719" style="s2">just mean it i don&#39;t mean that all women</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.880" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">are like that i mean that&#39;s a tendency</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.719" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">uh probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:53.279" style="s2">okay right but on the other hand i i</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">want to also say that i think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive kind of hysteria this</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">kind of fiery energy like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:00.800" style="s2">you know paglia seems almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.719" style="s2">staring when she talks right she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.800" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">she&#39;s like almost possessed by something</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.719" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">and that that could be uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">right right and it&#39;s important for us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">distinguish between these two types of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:12.080" style="s2">hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">we have on the you know shamanistic</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.080" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">expressive</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">poster i don&#39;t think that should be</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:17.679" style="s2">called hysteria we we should regulate</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">hysteria to</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">what what you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">unhinged and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">the forgotten the gone you know um</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:27.120" style="s2">emotions take charge and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:30.640" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.120" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">like any rationality at all like that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.640" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">hysteria on not creativity you know not</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">just going wild and letting oneself go</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think that should should</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">be called hysteria but a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">yeah and freud when he talked about</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">hysteria he was talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">victorian age when</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">reality was was very much repressed so</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:51.920" style="s2">so that was part of it as well right</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">yeah yeah i think it conservatives are</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.920" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">too quick to label women as</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">hysterical just because they like say</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t seem feminine</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:01.600" style="s2">you know i would never do such a thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.600" end="01:11:06.150" style="s2">no not you no yeah many not not all</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.150" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">conservative i don&#39;t know if they ever</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:16.880" style="s2">like rachel&#39;s book is called the the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.120" end="01:11:18.960" style="s2">new alt right and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.880" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve identified with the right in some</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.960" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">way and you seem to be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">like a radical artist like some of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:25.280" style="s2">people i i knew in the 90s who were</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.280" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">always on the left and the left used to</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:33.199" style="s2">be all about free expression and</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:35.760" style="s2">and uh and uh and uh live and let live</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.199" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">and and whereas whereas today it seems</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.760" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">to be almost the opposites like</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">we talked about that also this inversion</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">i i just want to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">clear my book is the new art the new art</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:48.239" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">not there&#39;s no alt yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.239" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">right i i thought i said art great but</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">yeah okay so it&#39;s the new art right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about art being</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.320" style="s2">lifted out of the norms of political</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:02.239" style="s2">correctness</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.320" end="01:12:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s about having a vitalist movement of</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.239" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.440" end="01:12:09.280" style="s2">it&#39;s about using the ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">hierarchy and tradition in an occult</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:14.480" style="s2">sense in a metaphysical realm</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">creating an aesthetic right an art right</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">a creative</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">vitalist right and that&#39;s what my book</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">is about it is definitely um</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">not traditionally right-wing um and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:26.960" style="s2">would think people would get it you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">because they have the word art</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.960" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">before the word right but some people</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s like some traditional</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">right-wing</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:34.320" style="s2">book and then they read it and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:38.159" style="s2">like no that&#39;s not it um</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.320" end="01:12:41.040" style="s2">so so yeah um and the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.159" end="01:12:42.480" style="s2">the left has lost that creative vitalism</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">and have also stood my questioning of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.040" end="01:14:36.400" style="s2">like the milieu that we were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">immersed in</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.400" end="01:14:40.400" style="s2">um i went to the evergreen state college</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">in olympia washington</p>

<p begin="01:14:50.239" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">professors for years</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:55.040" style="s2">um and i studied evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">under them so</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.040" end="01:14:58.560" style="s2">like i was always kind of in this weird</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.000" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.560" end="01:15:02.159" style="s2">like antithetical milieu at that school</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">but there was all this you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.159" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">all this tension</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:06.320" style="s2">and of course i wanted to assimilate but</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.719" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">also it was like learning these other</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.320" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2">things that went against</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.679" end="01:15:12.080" style="s2">a social narrative and i&#39;ve yeah i have</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.640" end="01:15:13.120" style="s2">one really good friend who&#39;s seen me</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.080" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">through all of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.120" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">um and she has you know she&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">left than i am</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:20.640" style="s2">but uh she&#39;s been able to deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:22.560" style="s2">disagreements</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.640" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">and differences between the two of us</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.560" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:31.199" style="s2">right okay okay you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.360" end="01:15:33.040" style="s2">because i was wondering and i&#39;m i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.199" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">sure if i can</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:39.280" style="s2">you know formulate that thought properly</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">uh without you know because you know in</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.280" end="01:15:43.080" style="s2">recent times i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:44.239" style="s2">like all these things they have like a</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.080" end="01:15:47.280" style="s2">quasi-religious</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.239" end="01:15:48.080" style="s2">quality you know it&#39;s like um and so and</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.280" end="01:15:49.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.080" end="01:15:52.400" style="s2">you can observe it not only in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.920" end="01:15:54.560" style="s2">social justice movement but also like</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.400" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">say in spiritual things you know where</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.560" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">you see</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:16:02.480" style="s2">that because and i hope i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:03.360" style="s2">phrase that wrong because women have</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.480" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:10.400" style="s2">freedom today they are way more</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">say uninhibited to you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:14.560" style="s2">fall into this kind of religious stage</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.280" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">where they inhabit a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.560" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">completely new world view say in</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.280" end="01:16:23.760" style="s2">spirituality or in politics</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.760" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">without being rational</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:30.159" style="s2">enough to you know to know</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">how do i say this you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.159" end="01:16:33.280" style="s2">relativity of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">saying and i don&#39;t mean it in a bad way</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:39.199" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a result</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">of that historically speaking new phase</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.199" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">we&#39;re into where men</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">you know can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t impose their</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.320" end="01:16:53.679" style="s2">world view on women anymore</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">but at the same time it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.679" end="01:16:59.440" style="s2">as a a subgroup of those women</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:00.400" style="s2">run amok with their worldview in a kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.440" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">of way without</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.400" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">questioning that do you know where where</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:05.520" style="s2">i&#39;m coming from</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:08.239" style="s2">and so how how do you deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.520" end="01:17:10.640" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s your take on that</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.239" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">i mean honestly because because i have</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.640" end="01:17:14.840" style="s2">to add one thing because</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:16.320" style="s2">the problem is that you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.840" end="01:17:19.199" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.320" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">uh with and to these women without</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.199" end="01:17:23.440" style="s2">submitting to their world view and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">makes a rational discourse like kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.440" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">complicated yeah and they usually have</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">men hanging around too that are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.040" end="01:17:34.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t talk to women like that like i</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.040" end="01:17:37.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">for being neurotic and not having</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.640" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">like social justice activists they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:18:00.080" style="s2">not even in my sphere</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:00.640" style="s2">right i&#39;m dealing with the the other end</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.080" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.640" end="01:18:04.880" style="s2">i&#39;m dealing with women who who are</p>

<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:46.320" style="s2">the healing goddesses the hashtag</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.199" end="01:18:49.120" style="s2">gratitudes</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.320" end="01:18:50.960" style="s2">right they&#39;re a mob they&#39;re they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.120" end="01:18:53.040" style="s2">mod they they have their self</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.960" end="01:18:54.159" style="s2">care smoothies and their their healing</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.040" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">crystals and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.159" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that you should interact</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">with them now if they&#39;re coming at you</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:02.640" style="s2">because really they&#39;re very angry deep</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">down no i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.640" end="01:19:07.120" style="s2">i just don&#39;t touch them no i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.120" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it in that way that</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.120" end="01:19:10.719" style="s2">i or we we shouldn&#39;t interact with them</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:14.400" style="s2">the question would be the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.719" end="01:19:17.520" style="s2">like how how you know what would be</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.400" end="01:19:21.040" style="s2">the proper step or</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.520" end="01:19:23.360" style="s2">or say culturally speaking like for them</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:24.320" style="s2">you know to have a perspective on their</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.360" end="01:19:26.800" style="s2">worldview and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.320" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">being instead of being inhabited by the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:31.920" style="s2">right because i think that&#39;s the part of</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">a philosopher to say well</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.920" end="01:19:35.440" style="s2">there are world views and i can can have</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">a critical distance</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.440" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">to it and i can if you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">philosophy you can even have like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">critical distance and you should to your</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">own worldview</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:44.560" style="s2">and that then then it gets interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.040" end="01:19:45.360" style="s2">but if you talk to social justice</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.560" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">warriors or</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.360" end="01:19:49.120" style="s2">new age people and i think with men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.120" end="01:19:52.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s like if you&#39;re inhabited by it</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">and you can&#39;t have a critical distance</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.640" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">then like a discourse is really</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:58.880" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:19:58.880" style="s2">problematic right</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.920" end="01:20:03.920" style="s2">so what yeah what do you do from from</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.159" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">from i think that&#39;s really problematic</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.920" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">what you said tom</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.360" end="01:20:11.760" style="s2">i i just think that it&#39;s best to freedom</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:14.400" style="s2">of association</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.760" end="01:20:15.199" style="s2">like don&#39;t go to events that they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.400" end="01:20:17.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.199" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to them maybe that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.679" end="01:20:20.960" style="s2">sounds dismissive</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to be dismissive here</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.960" end="01:20:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like 10 women you can talk to</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.560" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">you know and</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.280" end="01:20:29.679" style="s2">and two of them are interesting logical</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">rational and you got eight of them</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.679" end="01:20:33.360" style="s2">talking about like the healing goddess</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">of the moon</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.360" end="01:20:36.960" style="s2">and like the vaginal painting of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:39.600" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.960" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">like would talk to the two like that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.600" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">still i&#39;m still not</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:45.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean that personally you know i</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:48.000" style="s2">i i i just mean like what can they do</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.600" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">no it&#39;s like as a cultural as a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.000" end="01:20:51.280" style="s2">development so</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.960" end="01:20:52.560" style="s2">women have this freedom now to choose</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.280" end="01:20:54.880" style="s2">their worldview and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.560" end="01:20:56.320" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s like in in human</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.880" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">histories of time</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.320" end="01:20:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like a really short period when</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">they can do that</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.520" end="01:21:03.360" style="s2">like 50 years and so it&#39;s like okay we</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:06.080" style="s2">had like say</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.360" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">40 000 years of male dominated world</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.080" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">views or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.960" style="s2">and so and so suddenly females are able</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:14.560" style="s2">to to do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.960" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">but it seems to me at one point that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.560" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">have developed culturally you know a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:21.679" style="s2">form of critical</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t mean that in that way men</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.679" end="01:21:24.560" style="s2">majority of men can&#39;t do that either so</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.520" end="01:21:26.239" style="s2">don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.560" end="01:21:27.600" style="s2">but the point is like culturally</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.239" end="01:21:30.480" style="s2">speaking so what</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.600" end="01:21:31.280" style="s2">you know how what would you propose what</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.480" end="01:21:33.600" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.280" end="01:21:35.120" style="s2">you know the next step you know i know</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.600" end="01:21:36.159" style="s2">how i deal with those women you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.120" end="01:21:38.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not that&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.159" end="01:21:39.679" style="s2">did sue me and for the women i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">think we should</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.679" end="01:21:43.040" style="s2">for the women yeah i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:45.040" style="s2">should force change</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.040" end="01:21:47.040" style="s2">upon them we should let them do what</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.040" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">they want right like i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.040" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:52.639" style="s2">our job to tell them how to</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">if i just think that&#39;s why i say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.639" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">better to avoid that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:57.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s a dismissive answer but</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.000" end="01:22:01.199" style="s2">because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.760" end="01:22:04.639" style="s2">our duty to make them more like us we</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.199" end="01:22:08.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s inauthentic right okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.639" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">do i know yeah i mean i i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.320" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">i think that also like</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.560" end="01:22:16.159" style="s2">women have had their world views in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">past it&#39;s just that it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.159" end="01:22:20.000" style="s2">it was not in the public sphere and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:22.400" style="s2">also i think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.000" end="01:22:24.159" style="s2">um you know so their way of influencing</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.400" end="01:22:25.920" style="s2">was happening within the home they would</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.159" end="01:22:29.440" style="s2">you know influence their husbands</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.920" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">or their sons or their fathers to</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.440" end="01:22:33.360" style="s2">kind of enact their own political</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:35.360" style="s2">interests or social interests</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.360" end="01:22:37.760" style="s2">women had this kind of soft power and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.360" end="01:22:39.600" style="s2">see that now operating but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.760" end="01:22:41.120" style="s2">engaged in a public sphere</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.600" end="01:22:43.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s also an issue of men</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:46.560" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.120" end="01:22:49.840" style="s2">turning themselves away from women and</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.560" end="01:22:51.760" style="s2">keeping to their own ideas and not</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.840" end="01:22:54.000" style="s2">letting the soft power of women</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.760" end="01:22:55.920" style="s2">influence their thinking</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.000" end="01:22:57.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s kind of where i see</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.920" end="01:23:00.000" style="s2">another issue</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.280" end="01:23:01.120" style="s2">is that if women are then exerting this</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.000" end="01:23:04.000" style="s2">like power</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.120" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">of their kind of radically subjective</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.000" end="01:23:08.639" style="s2">experience of their ideas</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:11.840" style="s2">so having no kind of internal distance</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.639" end="01:23:14.800" style="s2">um in into in their interior between</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.840" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">their kind of eye and the world view</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.800" end="01:23:17.679" style="s2">that they are</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:18.560" style="s2">kind of playing around with or or</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.679" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">exploring</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:22.000" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s no gap there and</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.320" end="01:23:24.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re radically their eye</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:26.080" style="s2">and the world view are a singularity in</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.560" end="01:23:28.639" style="s2">terms of their internal experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.080" end="01:23:29.840" style="s2">right not having that gap um you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.639" end="01:23:31.760" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.840" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">because of the sexual dynamics between</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.760" end="01:23:35.920" style="s2">men and women and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:37.440" style="s2">the availability of women in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.920" end="01:23:41.520" style="s2">long-term partnership is so</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.440" end="01:23:43.679" style="s2">scarce you know and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.520" end="01:23:45.520" style="s2">power dimension between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.679" end="01:23:46.480" style="s2">and the fact that lots of men just like</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.520" end="01:23:48.560" style="s2">get in line</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.480" end="01:23:49.600" style="s2">to conform to what women want right in</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.560" end="01:23:51.440" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.600" end="01:23:53.120" style="s2">get attention from women because of</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.440" end="01:23:55.440" style="s2">course people want attention from women</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.120" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">but like that&#39;s just the thing like</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.440" end="01:24:00.000" style="s2">people want attention from</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:01.280" style="s2">young beautiful women and so if those</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:02.800" style="s2">young beautiful women have certain kinds</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.280" end="01:24:04.880" style="s2">of world views</p>

<p begin="01:31:32.639" end="01:31:37.679" style="s2">well i think that it&#39;s okay to use the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.760" end="01:31:40.320" style="s2">term philosopher queen because</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.679" end="01:31:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not about getting people into a box</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.320" end="01:31:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.520" end="01:31:45.440" style="s2">putting people in a place where they</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.600" end="01:31:47.120" style="s2">feel free to express themselves</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.440" end="01:31:48.880" style="s2">free thought has always been my top</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.120" end="01:31:50.800" style="s2">priority and i believe that</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.880" end="01:31:52.719" style="s2">it&#39;s raven&#39;s top priority or one of her</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.800" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">top priorities too it&#39;s about freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.719" end="01:31:55.120" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:31:56.639" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s why we created blessed</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.120" end="01:32:00.400" style="s2">earthquakes for freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.639" end="01:32:03.520" style="s2">fact um freedom of expression freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.400" end="01:32:05.440" style="s2">gender you know free freedom um</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.520" end="01:32:07.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important thing to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.440" end="01:32:09.920" style="s2">arts the philosophy the culture</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.679" end="01:32:11.360" style="s2">um so you know terminology though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.920" end="01:32:12.080" style="s2">right it does have a tendency to get</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.360" end="01:32:13.840" style="s2">bogged down</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.080" end="01:32:15.679" style="s2">and you know wants you to find something</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.840" end="01:32:16.560" style="s2">you know i&#39;m good good luck keeping it</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.679" end="01:32:18.400" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.560" end="01:32:20.560" style="s2">i&#39;m sure that in like 10 years from now</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.400" end="01:32:21.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll have philosopher queens for</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.560" end="01:32:23.600" style="s2">people that would like to file their</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.840" end="01:32:24.719" style="s2">original message and like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.600" end="01:32:26.400" style="s2">kicked out and we&#39;re like no longer</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.719" end="01:32:27.040" style="s2">philosopher queens and we hate what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.400" end="01:32:29.520" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.040" end="01:32:31.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s like every group that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.520" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">every subculture that&#39;s every movement</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.440" end="01:32:36.400" style="s2">that&#39;s every political party</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:39.440" style="s2">um the things change things evolve</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.400" end="01:32:41.840" style="s2">things take on new forms and</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.440" end="01:32:43.679" style="s2">you know if philosopher queen becomes</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.840" end="01:32:44.239" style="s2">something that we&#39;re against um we can</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.679" end="01:32:46.880" style="s2">either like</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.239" end="01:32:48.560" style="s2">fight for the term or you know forge</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.880" end="01:32:51.600" style="s2">forward with a new term and</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.560" end="01:32:52.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it depends on the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.600" end="01:32:54.159" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.400" end="01:32:55.840" style="s2">so i really i do appreciate what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.159" end="01:32:57.679" style="s2">saying um</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.840" end="01:32:59.920" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense why</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.679" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">you would have these concerns and i have</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.920" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">these concerns also</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.520" end="01:33:08.360" style="s2">i think that um i don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.639" end="01:33:10.800" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.360" end="01:33:12.880" style="s2">anti-hierarchy either</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.800" end="01:33:14.239" style="s2">um i i think that there&#39;s definitely an</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.880" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">elitist streak</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.239" end="01:33:21.120" style="s2">in both rachel and my philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:24.159" style="s2">and the queen also invokes the matriarch</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.120" end="01:33:24.960" style="s2">um the the most powerful woman of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.159" end="01:33:26.320" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.960" end="01:33:28.000" style="s2">and i think that there&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.320" end="01:33:30.000" style="s2">hyperstational quality</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.000" end="01:33:32.560" style="s2">to the invocation of the philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.000" end="01:33:36.000" style="s2">queen i wouldn&#39;t consider myself</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.560" end="01:33:38.400" style="s2">at this time a queen um i would consider</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.000" end="01:33:39.520" style="s2">myself working towards becoming the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.400" end="01:33:42.320" style="s2">matriarch</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.520" end="01:33:42.880" style="s2">and there is a commitment to the process</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.320" end="01:33:44.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.880" end="01:33:46.560" style="s2">generating what what is the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.880" end="01:33:49.120" style="s2">the woman right</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.560" end="01:33:50.480" style="s2">um and how that derives and arises out</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.120" end="01:33:52.400" style="s2">of the body of the woman</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.480" end="01:33:53.679" style="s2">and what she is kind of tasked with</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.400" end="01:33:56.000" style="s2">throughout her life</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.679" end="01:33:57.600" style="s2">and i think for me the attraction to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.000" end="01:34:00.639" style="s2">concept of queen</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.600" end="01:34:03.040" style="s2">um is of</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.639" end="01:34:04.159" style="s2">that matriarchal figure of like the</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.040" end="01:34:07.520" style="s2">grandmother</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.159" end="01:34:10.000" style="s2">you know of like the woman who has</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.520" end="01:34:11.760" style="s2">children and grandchildren and</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.000" end="01:34:13.760" style="s2">great-grandchildren who</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:15.679" style="s2">guides the other women throughout all of</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.760" end="01:34:16.880" style="s2">these different developmental processes</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.679" end="01:34:20.000" style="s2">in their lives</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.880" end="01:34:22.639" style="s2">and also you know gives guidance to</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:23.600" style="s2">the patriarchs when they need their</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.639" end="01:34:25.360" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.600" end="01:34:28.480" style="s2">the wisdom of the women to guide them</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.360" end="01:34:31.520" style="s2">and so i think that that invocation</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.480" end="01:34:32.159" style="s2">is an invitation for women to consider</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.520" end="01:34:35.440" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.159" end="01:34:37.679" style="s2">as more than princesses you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.440" end="01:34:39.679" style="s2">as as more than just like wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.679" end="01:34:42.239" style="s2">have people lay at their feet</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.679" end="01:34:42.960" style="s2">wanting to be giving gifts wanted to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.239" end="01:34:45.119" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.960" end="01:34:46.239" style="s2">treated with this um kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.119" end="01:34:49.280" style="s2">goddess-like</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.239" end="01:34:51.360" style="s2">worshipping the queen is not someone to</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.280" end="01:34:53.360" style="s2">be merely worshipped but she wields the</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.360" end="01:34:55.199" style="s2">power of the sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.360" end="01:34:57.760" style="s2">she wields the power of the sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.199" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">and that is a grave responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.760" end="01:35:01.199" style="s2">but you have to prepare yourself for</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.360" end="01:35:02.800" style="s2">taking on that responsibility and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.199" end="01:35:04.800" style="s2">not something that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.800" end="01:35:06.000" style="s2">you know give to yourself it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.800" end="01:35:08.560" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.000" end="01:35:10.880" style="s2">given to you you know i was surprised</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.560" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">like when people began to</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.880" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">you know because the philosopher queen</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.159" end="01:35:20.159" style="s2">you know rachel and i philosopher queens</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.639" end="01:35:22.400" style="s2">is like to be given that</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.159" end="01:35:23.280" style="s2">title and to be recognized for that</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.400" end="01:35:25.199" style="s2">title</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.280" end="01:35:26.639" style="s2">and you know to give it to oneself i</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.199" end="01:35:29.760" style="s2">think is a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.639" end="01:35:32.159" style="s2">um dynamic but to invoke it in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.760" end="01:35:33.360" style="s2">hyperstational manner and then to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.159" end="01:35:35.920" style="s2">seen in that manner</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.360" end="01:35:37.679" style="s2">means that we&#39;re rising you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.920" end="01:35:38.960" style="s2">rising to take on the responsibility of</p>

<p begin="01:39:33.920" end="01:39:36.800" style="s2">language or something</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.520" end="01:39:39.040" style="s2">and then and then it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a</p>

<p begin="01:39:41.520" end="01:39:44.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.480" end="01:39:46.320" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s very i find that very</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.639" end="01:39:48.800" style="s2">interesting that uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.320" end="01:39:50.880" style="s2">between you two guys well would you say</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.800" end="01:39:52.800" style="s2">that nietzsche was a philosopher or a</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.880" end="01:39:54.639" style="s2">poet because he spoke like that</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.800" end="01:39:55.920" style="s2">all the time oh yeah okay maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.639" end="01:39:59.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.920" end="01:40:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a false uh dichotomy or even</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.280" end="01:40:03.440" style="s2">somebody like well but nietzsche was the</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.000" end="01:40:05.040" style="s2">high water mark on</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.440" end="01:40:06.880" style="s2">german literature so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.040" end="01:40:09.040" style="s2">complicated with nature</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.880" end="01:40:09.040" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.239" end="01:40:20.639" style="s2">there are a lot of philosophers that</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.320" end="01:40:23.199" style="s2">grow with the vitalistic impulse</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.639" end="01:40:24.320" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just just ninja he wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.199" end="01:40:27.440" style="s2">only one</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.320" end="01:40:28.080" style="s2">that did it on renee and i mean like</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.440" end="01:40:30.880" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.080" end="01:40:33.119" style="s2">like writing his sister and they were</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.880" end="01:40:35.520" style="s2">poetically there was a pre</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.119" end="01:40:36.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a curse a precursor to each</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.520" end="01:40:40.080" style="s2">other it was called novalis</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.960" end="01:40:43.280" style="s2">um what what about um even the</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.080" end="01:40:45.360" style="s2">um mishima when he wrote confessions of</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.280" end="01:40:47.199" style="s2">the mask it was poetic</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.360" end="01:40:48.719" style="s2">does that mean he&#39;s not a well he was</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.199" end="01:40:50.400" style="s2">masturbating he&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.719" end="01:40:52.000" style="s2">more of a poet than a philosopher right</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.400" end="01:40:52.480" style="s2">but what i&#39;m saying is that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.000" end="01:40:54.239" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.480" end="01:40:55.520" style="s2">lot of you can you can be a poetic</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.239" end="01:40:57.040" style="s2">philosopher of course</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.520" end="01:40:59.199" style="s2">um everything doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.040" end="01:41:02.000" style="s2">academic and dry</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.199" end="01:41:02.400" style="s2">you know um and raven she&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.000" end="01:41:04.080" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.400" end="01:41:06.239" style="s2">like on the logical end of things but</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.080" end="01:41:08.159" style="s2">she also speaks poetically she also uses</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.239" end="01:41:11.840" style="s2">creative language she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.159" end="01:41:15.600" style="s2">you know like stiff and and dull</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.840" end="01:41:15.600" style="s2">i&#39;m and then i think that the stiffness</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.000" end="01:41:20.960" style="s2">the dullness and the stiffness is like i</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.199" end="01:41:22.400" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t like that camille collier</p>

<p begin="01:41:27.119" end="01:41:31.280" style="s2">you know this is philosophy has room to</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.760" end="01:41:33.840" style="s2">be poetic philosophy should be</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.280" end="01:41:35.600" style="s2">poetic no i i didn&#39;t mean to say what i</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.840" end="01:41:38.159" style="s2">what i meant to say was that</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.600" end="01:41:39.920" style="s2">from from the viewpoint of the mastery</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.159" end="01:41:41.520" style="s2">of the german language</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.920" end="01:41:43.679" style="s2">there was nobody better who could do</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.520" end="01:41:45.280" style="s2">that than nietzsche basically</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.679" end="01:41:47.360" style="s2">yeah like nobody&#39;ll ever be better than</p>

<p begin="01:42:44.800" end="01:42:49.520" style="s2">i can get quite poetic and perhaps a</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.440" end="01:42:50.639" style="s2">little hysterical in the positive sense</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.520" end="01:42:52.239" style="s2">of the word um</p>

<p begin="01:45:36.159" end="01:45:39.440" style="s2">they might do their work outside the</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.760" end="01:45:41.679" style="s2">internet that think on</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.440" end="01:45:44.080" style="s2">on a similar wavelength and so people</p>

<p begin="01:46:19.199" end="01:46:22.480" style="s2">the divisional is like</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.400" end="01:46:24.960" style="s2">kind of an emergent property of of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.480" end="01:46:27.199" style="s2">tribe but the tribe is fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.960" end="01:46:28.880" style="s2">and we have this perception of ourselves</p>

<p begin="01:46:28.880" end="01:46:32.159" style="s2">and we go through this individuation</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.400" end="01:46:34.800" style="s2">process but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.159" end="01:46:35.920" style="s2">always this like kind of the ground of</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.800" end="01:46:38.800" style="s2">which we emerge</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.920" end="01:46:40.480" style="s2">is the hyper object of the tribe and by</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.800" end="01:46:41.360" style="s2">extension the hyper object of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.480" end="01:46:43.199" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.360" end="01:46:44.560" style="s2">which is of course nested within you</p>

<p begin="01:46:47.440" end="01:46:50.480" style="s2">interesting i think how people are</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.719" end="01:46:53.040" style="s2">seeking stable forms</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.480" end="01:46:55.199" style="s2">in a time where there&#39;s all of this kind</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.040" end="01:46:56.560" style="s2">of uh chaotic instability happening</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.199" end="01:46:58.239" style="s2">within hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.560" end="01:46:59.760" style="s2">that is the emergence of these very</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.239" end="01:47:02.560" style="s2">simple kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.760" end="01:47:03.440" style="s2">um almost molecular bonds right you you</p>

<p begin="01:47:20.000" end="01:47:22.960" style="s2">back into the occultism for me which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.080" end="01:47:24.960" style="s2">like</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.600" end="01:47:49.520" style="s2">private has become</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.520" end="01:47:50.560" style="s2">the you know kind of voyeuristic</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.520" end="01:47:53.679" style="s2">pleasure</p>

<p begin="01:47:57.520" end="01:48:02.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s just one particular example</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.440" end="01:48:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s this like drive to expose</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.239" end="01:48:07.520" style="s2">which i think has a hyper normal kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.520" end="01:48:09.920" style="s2">quality to it because that would have</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.520" end="01:48:11.760" style="s2">typically been that which was hidden</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.920" end="01:48:13.520" style="s2">and so as as humans we&#39;re kind of</p>

<p begin="01:50:34.719" end="01:50:39.040" style="s2">it requires maturity and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.840" end="01:50:40.960" style="s2">what the growth process</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.040" end="01:50:42.159" style="s2">is it&#39;s to engage in these like</p>

<p begin="01:50:50.080" end="01:50:53.520" style="s2">quality in it absolutely and that that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:50:56.400" end="01:51:01.119" style="s2">anyone else it lives in a private realm</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.480" end="01:51:02.560" style="s2">right and i guess i guess that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.119" end="01:51:05.760" style="s2">true what you&#39;re saying that that</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.560" end="01:51:06.800" style="s2">this this extreme exposure of of every</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.760" end="01:51:08.639" style="s2">taboo</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.800" end="01:51:10.560" style="s2">right at least visually is like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.639" end="01:51:12.560" style="s2">like okay now we have to bring back</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.560" end="01:51:14.239" style="s2">taboo or something we have to bring back</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.560" end="01:51:16.000" style="s2">uh you know we have to bring back the</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.239" end="01:51:19.119" style="s2">hidden the secret the</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.000" end="01:51:20.960" style="s2">the occult but</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.119" end="01:51:22.320" style="s2">yeah a little sense to me at what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.960" end="01:51:25.280" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.320" end="01:51:27.280" style="s2">and also what&#39;s coming up too is like</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.280" end="01:51:29.440" style="s2">you know i think we kind of all gather</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.280" end="01:51:32.000" style="s2">around the</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.440" end="01:51:33.440" style="s2">you know the sons of these massive</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.000" end="01:51:35.760" style="s2">philosophical kings</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.440" end="01:51:36.719" style="s2">like hegel or nietzsche you know and</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.760" end="01:51:40.080" style="s2">we&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.719" end="01:51:41.679" style="s2">praise be but these are not only</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.080" end="01:51:43.280" style="s2">these these are not the only people out</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.679" end="01:51:45.199" style="s2">there like there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.280" end="01:51:47.040" style="s2">cast in their shadow and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.199" end="01:51:50.239" style="s2">also the occult path</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.040" end="01:51:52.080" style="s2">which is to go in and look for the</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.239" end="01:51:52.719" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t been placed on this</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.080" end="01:51:56.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.719" end="01:51:58.480" style="s2">level of celebrity um that towers above</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.560" end="01:52:00.320" style="s2">all else and i think that&#39;s where most</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.480" end="01:52:04.719" style="s2">of the women philosophers exist</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.320" end="01:52:06.239" style="s2">i think my experience the deepest people</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.719" end="01:52:08.719" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.239" end="01:52:09.440" style="s2">would never expose themselves to public</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.719" end="01:52:11.520" style="s2">scrutiny</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.440" end="01:52:13.520" style="s2">in any way like the deepest people i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.520" end="01:52:16.880" style="s2">met right</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.520" end="01:52:18.639" style="s2">like are hidden the deepest people are</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.880" end="01:52:20.239" style="s2">usually hidden and there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.639" end="01:52:21.920" style="s2">reason for that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.239" end="01:52:23.679" style="s2">because if they did this people were to</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.920" end="01:52:24.960" style="s2">go too much on the surface they would</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.679" end="01:52:26.159" style="s2">sacrifice who they were</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.960" end="01:52:27.360" style="s2">to appeal to people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.159" end="01:52:29.119" style="s2">understand them they would be putting</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.360" end="01:52:32.080" style="s2">curls before spine</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.119" end="01:52:34.480" style="s2">it&#39;s better for them for us to be in</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.080" end="01:52:37.679" style="s2">small groups communicating among people</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.480" end="01:52:39.360" style="s2">that we connect with not watering down</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.679" end="01:52:42.080" style="s2">or dumbing down our message for</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.360" end="01:52:42.639" style="s2">the public i would much rather have a</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.080" end="01:52:45.360" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.639" end="01:52:46.320" style="s2">group of philosophers that i can</p>

<p begin="01:52:46.320" end="01:52:51.040" style="s2">on a very personal realm then be in</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.360" end="01:52:51.679" style="s2">front of a huge crowd of people who i</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.040" end="01:52:54.800" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.679" end="01:52:56.960" style="s2">develop some you know fake message</p>

<p begin="01:53:10.639" end="01:53:14.800" style="s2">us to not go out</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.960" end="01:53:16.000" style="s2">into the public and and join the</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.800" end="01:53:18.159" style="s2">spectacle but for us</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.000" end="01:53:20.480" style="s2">to have deep intimate gatherings with</p>

<p begin="01:53:23.520" end="01:53:27.280" style="s2">to bring this to an end because i think</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.199" end="01:53:28.880" style="s2">that it could go we could go on for</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.280" end="01:53:30.639" style="s2">for a long time i think it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.880" end="01:53:33.040" style="s2">wonderful conversation</p>

<p begin="01:55:34.880" end="01:55:40.719" style="s2">and by having these very mature</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.920" end="01:55:41.840" style="s2">lucid conversations and digging into</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.719" end="01:55:45.199" style="s2">some of the most</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.840" end="01:55:46.800" style="s2">kind of difficult things to confront</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.199" end="01:55:49.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like this stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.800" end="01:55:50.320" style="s2">easy i mean there&#39;s some really dark</p>

<p begin="01:55:53.040" end="01:55:56.480" style="s2">of uncover but we actually have to talk</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.960" end="01:55:57.520" style="s2">about you know and we have to move</p>

<p begin="01:56:04.239" end="01:56:07.520" style="s2">significance</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.199" end="01:56:08.880" style="s2">right now um we&#39;re living in a time</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.520" end="01:56:10.960" style="s2">where we&#39;re reacting to</p>
