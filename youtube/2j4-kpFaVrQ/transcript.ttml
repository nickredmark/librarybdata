<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">it went on to read the listing society</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:06.810" style="s2">and I really was taken with them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve been communicating with some my</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.810" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">friends about this and one friend very</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">smart person asked me what did I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">think and I I told them about these</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">books that this might be the best stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever read on social change or it</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">also might be a handbook for nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">eighty-four plus plus haven&#39;t decided</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">yet so as you will see as we dig into</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">this the answer might just be both so</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">here we go my first question for you is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">meta modernism which is your</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">philosophical base for both these books</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">as the next step but including</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">post-modernism and I gotta tell you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">personally I&#39;ve found post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">post modernist to be essentially crazy</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2"> yeah by view is the person that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">actually took it seriously wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">be able to actually exist in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">or do anything productive you know of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">the thousand people I know well enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">to make a guess about it I&#39;d say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">three are actually post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">actually believe it actually try to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:09.509" style="s2">it many others especially in academia or</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">what I&#39;ve come to call as if pomos they</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.509" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">utter the words they make the sounds</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">they may have some superficial behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:19.349" style="s2">but I don&#39;t believe they actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:21.989" style="s2">believe it so my first question for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.349" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">is do you think post-modernism is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.989" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">a widespread thing in this world I do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s very widespread it events of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:31.379" style="s2">course on what we mean with</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">post-modernism we can describe it as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.379" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">kind of sensibility pertaining to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">times after the 1968 revolution let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:45.379" style="s2">say and particularly breaking through in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:50.180" style="s2">academia and the 70s and 80s and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.379" end="00:02:54.329" style="s2">popular culture in the 90s and the 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.180" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">however the way I mostly use it and we I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.329" end="00:02:59.370" style="s2">think it&#39;s most Mieville to use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">developmental stage so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.370" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">developmental stage either of a person</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">and his or her ideas and sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">about the world or of a certain society</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">and a certain morality and certain form</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:20.549" style="s2">of reasoning a certain means and values</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:21.150" style="s2">means being like genes in organisms in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.549" end="00:03:24.450" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.150" end="00:03:27.209" style="s2">but in cultures instead so different</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:30.989" style="s2">forms or ideas or patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.209" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">reproduce themselves and when a society</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.989" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">has been modern for a long enough time</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">and it hasn&#39;t crashed under its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:40.040" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:43.739" style="s2">then unmistakeably there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.040" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">sub-element of postmodern values so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.739" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">starting with modernity early on there</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">was a protest against the callous cold</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:58.169" style="s2">empirical hand of the Enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:04:00.660" style="s2">the the striving towards universality</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.169" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">there was also a kind of dream of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.660" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">something particular a world that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:08.579" style="s2">can be different given that we have all</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">of these modern possibilities even that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.579" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">we have applied science couldn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">world be fairer couldn&#39;t it be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">sustainable couldn&#39;t be less alienating</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">and in different ways and forms</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">postmodern ideas and value stand have</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">followed modern society around for 200</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:27.469" style="s2">years and that they have grown from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:30.599" style="s2">trickle to serious attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.469" end="00:04:32.250" style="s2">redefine modernity and for instance</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.599" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">through socialist revolutions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.250" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">recreate society and created at a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:42.300" style="s2">and higher stage today as I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:45.810" style="s2">or there are good reasons to believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">that about 20 to 25 percent of the adult</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.810" end="00:04:51.409" style="s2">population in rich countries or Western</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:53.069" style="s2">countries are post modernists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.409" end="00:04:56.039" style="s2">experience the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.069" end="00:04:58.129" style="s2">postmodern lens and that they express in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.039" end="00:05:02.099" style="s2">their lives and works and relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.129" end="00:05:05.430" style="s2">postmodern values the postmodern values</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.099" end="00:05:08.909" style="s2">then they try to create something better</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.430" end="00:05:12.180" style="s2">than the mainstream capitalist society</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.909" end="00:05:15.029" style="s2">and they believe that modernity and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.180" end="00:05:17.639" style="s2">story of progress isn&#39;t necessarily true</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.029" end="00:05:21.659" style="s2">and that you can critique it by shifting</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.639" end="00:05:24.449" style="s2">perspectives by including the excluded</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.659" end="00:05:26.340" style="s2">voices or so on and porom playing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.449" end="00:05:28.500" style="s2">new perspectives in the arts or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.340" end="00:05:30.539" style="s2">and that there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.500" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">emancipation or liberation or</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.539" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">redefinition of everyday life that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">possible so it&#39;s a kind of religion a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">critic of the religion of critique or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:43.169" style="s2">the religion of criticism that has grown</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:44.759" style="s2">through intellectual practice of modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.169" end="00:05:49.409" style="s2">society in a way it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.759" end="00:05:51.539" style="s2">priesthood of traditional society and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.409" end="00:05:54.330" style="s2">that sense I believe it is very real I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.539" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">just don&#39;t think it has the answers for</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.330" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">the next stage of society which is why</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:03.409" style="s2">perpetually it puts us in and killed the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">socks in dead ends and this produces</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.409" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">reactionary neo reactions that we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:12.750" style="s2">today seeing on a wide massive scale</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:15.779" style="s2">taking over pretty much all of the major</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.750" end="00:06:17.939" style="s2">governments in the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.779" end="00:06:20.039" style="s2">interesting you know obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.939" end="00:06:22.289" style="s2">200-year parts interesting because what</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.039" end="00:06:24.539" style="s2">I would describe what you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.289" end="00:06:26.759" style="s2">about is not necessarily post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.539" end="00:06:29.099" style="s2">but what are the branches of modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.759" end="00:06:30.629" style="s2">and I call it the Rousseau branch when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.099" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">look back at the Enlightenment I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.629" end="00:06:34.439" style="s2">basically divided the world into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">Voltaire branch and the Rousseau branch</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.439" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">and there were so branch then led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">romanticism which then led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:43.130" style="s2">totalitarianism which</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">then led to post-modernism and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.130" end="00:06:48.920" style="s2">essentially part post-modernism I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:51.530" style="s2">describe as a heresy of modernism in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.920" end="00:06:54.350" style="s2">same way that communism is a heresy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.530" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">modernism and I think it&#39;s so strange</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.350" end="00:06:58.610" style="s2">and weird dead-end and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">particularly in its academic status</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.610" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">where essentially rejects science as a</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.619" end="00:18:27.869" style="s2">this is actually goes back to to exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.470" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">what we have been speaking about so</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.869" end="00:18:32.389" style="s2">let&#39;s say we have a time machine and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:37.399" style="s2">can go anywhere in the world with it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.389" end="00:18:42.779" style="s2">we go to I don&#39;t know we go to Rome in</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.399" end="00:18:45.149" style="s2">the two hundreds after Christ and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.779" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">talk to people in the street and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.149" end="00:18:49.980" style="s2">asked them about questions about slavery</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">we ask them questions about death</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.789" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">them we asked them about proper</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.119" end="00:19:11.789" style="s2">very crude it&#39;s very grim</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:13.649" style="s2">this wouldn&#39;t be bad people though we</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.649" end="00:19:18.509" style="s2">laugh and talk and they would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.720" end="00:19:20.580" style="s2">friendly and perhaps we could fall in</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.509" end="00:19:22.590" style="s2">love with him and they with us but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.580" end="00:19:25.409" style="s2">would have values that are very alien to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.590" end="00:19:29.700" style="s2">us and that we would find horribly crude</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.409" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">and that just seemed cruel and unjust</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.700" end="00:19:38.159" style="s2">and if we take one of them and place</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:43.080" style="s2">them in let&#39;s say a small town in Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.159" end="00:19:45.509" style="s2">so people here are polite and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.080" end="00:19:48.809" style="s2">relatively highly educated in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.509" end="00:19:51.210" style="s2">world and all of that and this person</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.809" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">tries to understand their stances on</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.210" end="00:19:56.460" style="s2">slavery on punishment on gender equality</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:59.730" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:20:01.799" style="s2">rights and even on animals or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.730" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">biosphere they would find all of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.799" end="00:20:08.610" style="s2">things meaningless abstract wishy-washy</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:11.190" style="s2">being too complicated that their being</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.610" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2">that their suffocatingly politically</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.190" end="00:20:16.399" style="s2">correct and so on and that&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.950" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">fundamental difference than that aha</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.399" end="00:20:22.669" style="s2">there is some kind of shift there</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:25.289" style="s2">between this Roman citizen and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.669" end="00:20:29.279" style="s2">contemporary Swedish citizens for</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.289" end="00:20:31.259" style="s2">instance and what is that difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.279" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">well okay they have different norms I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.259" end="00:20:36.419" style="s2">guess you could say or you could say</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:38.580" style="s2">that they have different that their</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.419" end="00:20:40.499" style="s2">personalities were shaped differently by</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.580" end="00:20:43.940" style="s2">different societies and-and-and life</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.499" end="00:20:47.309" style="s2">conditions and the question then is are</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.940" end="00:20:49.529" style="s2">these norms or personalities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.309" end="00:20:52.740" style="s2">perspectives that people hold are they</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.529" end="00:20:57.419" style="s2">arbitrarily ordered or is there a logic</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.740" end="00:21:01.320" style="s2">to them and idea value means is that AHA</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.419" end="00:21:04.499" style="s2">there our overarching deeper structures</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.320" end="00:21:06.899" style="s2">in how values are generated by societies</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.499" end="00:21:10.499" style="s2">or through the development of societies</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.899" end="00:21:12.840" style="s2">which will generate values that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.499" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">similar to one another or a correspond</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.840" end="00:21:18.470" style="s2">to one another and for this reason there</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:21.419" style="s2">is a huge difference between any</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.470" end="00:21:24.509" style="s2">agricultural society and any industrial</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.049" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">let&#39;s drill into that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:09.700" style="s2">probably the most interesting part for</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:12.620" style="s2">me in The Listening Society was you then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.700" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">decompose the effective value meme into</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.620" end="00:25:18.669" style="s2">four parts a model of higher our</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:21.890" style="s2">complexity code or symbol stage</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.669" end="00:25:23.720" style="s2">emotional state and emotional depth</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.890" end="00:25:26.390" style="s2">let&#39;s particularly drill into the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.720" end="00:25:28.610" style="s2">two of those and they&#39;re related in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.390" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">mind at least which is the model of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.610" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">hierarchical complexity and your stages</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:34.580" style="s2">or code concept could you jump into</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.919" style="s2">those mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.580" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">so the model of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.919" end="00:25:46.789" style="s2">is basically a mathematician of which</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:49.179" style="s2">means just clearly formulated the key</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.789" end="00:25:53.270" style="s2">elements of the different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.179" end="00:25:55.309" style="s2">cognitive complexity so we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.270" end="00:25:58.280" style="s2">children think less complex thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.309" end="00:26:00.350" style="s2">than adults they can still think</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.280" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">interesting thoughts or intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.350" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">thoughts but it just never happened ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:08.630" style="s2">in the history of the world that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">four-year-old came up with a new theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.630" end="00:26:14.150" style="s2">of physics and there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:16.730" style="s2">the brain of the four-year-old does not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.150" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">perform thoughts of the corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.730" end="00:26:19.850" style="s2">level of complexity it&#39;s not that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">can&#39;t teach a four-year-old physics you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.850" end="00:26:25.190" style="s2">can this just is going to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">simple physics and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.190" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">Piaget was a Swiss classic theorist on</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:34.850" style="s2">this and an researcher when it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.680" style="s2">to Kohlberg and my own</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.850" end="00:26:39.050" style="s2">mentor than michael commons was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.680" end="00:26:42.740" style="s2">student of Kohlberg Kohlberg created</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.050" end="00:26:46.670" style="s2">adult stages of development above normal</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.740" end="00:26:48.830" style="s2">adulthood with his moral reasoning tests</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.670" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">and what Michael</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.830" end="00:26:54.290" style="s2">he studied algebra for a while and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:58.070" style="s2">realized that he could use this or apply</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.290" end="00:27:00.740" style="s2">this to developmental theory and using</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.070" end="00:27:03.320" style="s2">abstract algebra he could then see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.740" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">aha there&#39;s a mathematical pattern to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.320" end="00:27:09.020" style="s2">here you can actually formulate what all</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:12.200" style="s2">of the stages are and this goes even</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.020" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">down to amoeba level and all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.200" end="00:27:17.690" style="s2">to Einstein level and then there are 17</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">such stages of adult development that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.690" end="00:27:21.860" style="s2">have been discovered and you could argue</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:23.690" style="s2">that there are higher stages but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.860" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">arguments growth in there and you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.690" end="00:27:27.740" style="s2">argue that there are lower stages but</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:29.300" style="s2">the model starts to break down there so</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.740" end="00:27:30.980" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like even even within</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.300" end="00:27:33.800" style="s2">physics of course theories have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.980" end="00:27:36.410" style="s2">certain reach different scales within</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.800" end="00:27:38.360" style="s2">physics use different models and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.410" end="00:27:40.340" style="s2">actually aren&#39;t compatible and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.360" end="00:27:43.660" style="s2">developmental psychology is like that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.340" end="00:27:47.090" style="s2">well so you have a strict behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.660" end="00:27:51.050" style="s2">empirical science of studying the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.090" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">complexity of behaviors and it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.050" end="00:27:56.930" style="s2">happens different adult human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.390" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">going to have or display behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.930" end="00:28:02.030" style="s2">thought patterns of different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">complexity so we are not all of us at</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.030" end="00:28:07.670" style="s2">the same stage of complexity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">our thought processes so as you bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.670" end="00:28:11.300" style="s2">that down a little bit let&#39;s get down</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:12.980" style="s2">more tangible yeah and talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.300" end="00:28:16.280" style="s2">some of these stages actually are of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.980" end="00:28:17.750" style="s2">hierarchical complexity ok they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.280" end="00:28:20.810" style="s2">the easiest in the world to understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.750" end="00:28:23.150" style="s2">but therefore with four ones that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.810" end="00:28:26.030" style="s2">bring up in the book that are covering</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.150" end="00:28:28.700" style="s2">most adult human beings and the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.030" end="00:28:30.830" style="s2">one would be abstract so abstract is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.700" end="00:28:33.110" style="s2">when you can formulate an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.830" end="00:28:35.210" style="s2">variable and you can understand that aha</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.110" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">even though I can&#39;t see it even though</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:43.160" style="s2">of this and then you can see it they</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.850" end="00:28:46.280" style="s2">could start reasoning about things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.160" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t there and this is almost all</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.280" end="00:28:52.890" style="s2">adult human beings reach this stage</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">most people reach it in about junior</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.890" end="00:28:59.460" style="s2">high but there is a stage above that one</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:02.429" style="s2">which more than half of adult human</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.460" end="00:29:05.909" style="s2">beings reach but not all of us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.429" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">called formal operations so that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.909" end="00:29:13.890" style="s2">you can take several abstract variables</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:17.070" style="s2">and you can formulate in your head a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.890" end="00:29:18.809" style="s2">linear or even nonlinear a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.070" end="00:29:21.299" style="s2">between them so you can see aha</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.809" end="00:29:24.570" style="s2">appears as though if this happened then</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.299" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">that happens and you can test such</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.570" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">formal relationships in your head and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:32.340" style="s2">that kind of corresponds to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">work we do in modern society a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.340" end="00:29:39.169" style="s2">is maximize the profit of this company</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:42.210" style="s2">for instance or minimize this input and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.169" end="00:29:45.419" style="s2">maximize this output for instance a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.210" end="00:29:48.360" style="s2">of this is formal operations and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.419" end="00:29:50.840" style="s2">usually sufficient to to function well</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.360" end="00:29:53.730" style="s2">within a modern labor economy or</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.840" end="00:29:56.549" style="s2">division of labor to function at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.730" end="00:29:59.460" style="s2">stage and to think along these processes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.549" end="00:30:02.900" style="s2">but above that you can create whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.460" end="00:30:05.700" style="s2">systems of formal relations this</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.900" end="00:30:08.820" style="s2">simplest ones we we learn in school by</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:11.490" style="s2">heart the simple equation systems where</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.820" end="00:30:13.380" style="s2">you have to use the information from one</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.490" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">equation to engage information about</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.380" end="00:30:16.590" style="s2">another equation then you have to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">the system where you can see different</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.590" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">feedback loops or whatever and only</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:26.309" style="s2">about 20% of an adult population reaches</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:28.740" style="s2">systemic reasoning which means that most</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.309" end="00:30:31.409" style="s2">academics will tend to be systemic stage</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.740" end="00:30:33.059" style="s2">thinkers but above that stage at only</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.409" end="00:30:35.340" style="s2">about one point eight percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.059" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">population you have meta systematic</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.340" end="00:30:40.110" style="s2">reasoning a menace systematic reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:42.900" style="s2">corresponds more to in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.110" end="00:30:46.380" style="s2">topology for instance that you can see</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.900" end="00:30:50.010" style="s2">that aha there are patterns within these</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.380" end="00:30:51.720" style="s2">systems there are properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.010" end="00:30:53.250" style="s2">systems themselves so you can compare</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.720" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">these different properties and you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.250" end="00:30:57.419" style="s2">switch between different systems and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.669" style="s2">can understand that the different</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.419" end="00:31:02.010" style="s2">systems have different logics so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.669" end="00:31:06.300" style="s2">tend to be less reductive in your thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.010" end="00:31:09.150" style="s2">and people who are a meta systemic tend</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.300" end="00:31:11.370" style="s2">to get less well along with people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.150" end="00:31:13.559" style="s2">are let&#39;s say it abstract because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.370" end="00:31:16.620" style="s2">people who are an abstract will think</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.559" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">that people are meta systemic just talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.620" end="00:31:21.870" style="s2">a lot and that they they aren&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:24.570" style="s2">concrete about what they do etc and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.870" end="00:31:26.010" style="s2">people who are at meta systemic will</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.570" end="00:31:29.220" style="s2">think people are abstract are but</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.010" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">shallow that they never really give them</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.220" end="00:31:34.260" style="s2">any a house when they speak to them and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:36.360" style="s2">so on but this is just one out of four</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.260" end="00:31:38.820" style="s2">fundamental ways of growing as human</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.360" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">being that yeah yeah let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.820" end="00:31:42.300" style="s2">code next I think that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:44.100" style="s2">introduction to your levels of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.300" end="00:31:46.500" style="s2">hierarchical complexity but the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.100" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">one that I found very interesting caused</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.500" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">me to think a lot about both myself and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:54.360" style="s2">sort of the nature of social</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">construction is your simple stages or</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.360" end="00:31:59.309" style="s2">your code mm-hmm if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:01.320" style="s2">previous theories on psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.309" end="00:32:03.150" style="s2">development they kind of mix all things</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.320" end="00:32:06.330" style="s2">up they say okay so there there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.150" end="00:32:08.130" style="s2">these people who are more modern and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.330" end="00:32:10.500" style="s2">then there are postmodern people or</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.130" end="00:32:12.540" style="s2">their color codes for these things and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.500" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">one theory that which is popular is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.540" end="00:32:17.250" style="s2">called spiral dynamics or you call</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:19.980" style="s2">modern people orange people and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.250" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">postmodern people to call them green but</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.980" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">the problem is well what if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:30.690" style="s2">try to compare this with history so</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">going back to medieval times and looking</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.690" end="00:32:35.610" style="s2">at a genius of medieval times they</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:39.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t understand Newton&#39;s physics or</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.610" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">indeed even a simple coordination of two</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.390" end="00:32:46.980" style="s2">variables on a grid this was invented by</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:50.090" style="s2">Descartes in the 1600s so even the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.980" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">smartest person in the world let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.090" end="00:32:56.730" style="s2">thomas of aquinas of the late medieval</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.490" end="00:32:59.100" style="s2">times wouldn&#39;t know things and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:33:01.890" style="s2">understand things and grasp things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.100" end="00:33:02.970" style="s2">are apparent even to a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.890" end="00:33:06.600" style="s2">12-year old</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.970" end="00:33:09.900" style="s2">so apparently society itself or culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.600" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">itself seems to have embedded within it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.900" end="00:33:15.539" style="s2">certain symbols or ideas that are of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:18.330" style="s2">different stages of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.539" end="00:33:20.759" style="s2">and because they are of different stages</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.330" end="00:33:23.700" style="s2">of complexity they are non arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.759" end="00:33:25.320" style="s2">ordered meaning that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:27.509" style="s2">difference between people who live in</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.320" end="00:33:29.399" style="s2">let&#39;s say an agricultural society like</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.509" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">medieval times and people who live in</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.399" end="00:33:34.229" style="s2">pre agricultural tribal societies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:37.100" style="s2">people who live in industrial societies</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.229" end="00:33:42.749" style="s2">or post-industrial societies like ours</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.100" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">so AHA there appears to be a logic to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.749" end="00:33:50.249" style="s2">how culture itself evolves not meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">that it always evolves in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.249" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">but there is a deep pattern or structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:58.109" style="s2">to it that the different modern</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:34:00.570" style="s2">societies of today are more comparable</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.109" end="00:34:03.409" style="s2">to one another than they are to even</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.570" end="00:34:05.999" style="s2">themselves looking 500 years back and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.409" end="00:34:07.470" style="s2">this catches another dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.999" end="00:34:09.750" style="s2">development one that isn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.470" end="00:34:14.220" style="s2">personal but is more sociological</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.750" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">nevertheless the culture itself must be</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.220" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">downloaded into every single human being</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:22.589" style="s2">for him or her to use it so people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:25.349" style="s2">are more complex thinkers will more</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.589" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">likely to find the code available in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.349" end="00:34:29.460" style="s2">that society that resonates with their</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">stage of mental complexity</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.460" end="00:34:33.899" style="s2">I mean vice versa of course if you come</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:36.419" style="s2">across a lot of the more complex code</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.899" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">that can also spur more complex thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.419" end="00:34:40.859" style="s2">in your mind and eventually may cause</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">you to think more complex thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.859" end="00:34:45.450" style="s2">yourself and have more complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:47.549" style="s2">perspectives that&#39;s interesting but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.450" end="00:34:49.530" style="s2">know I&#39;m gonna use myself as an example</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.549" end="00:34:52.109" style="s2">here when I went through your books I</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.530" end="00:34:53.909" style="s2">had to give myself a an honest analysis</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.109" end="00:34:56.190" style="s2">where do I stand on these various</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.909" end="00:34:59.220" style="s2">dimensions and I looked carefully and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.190" end="00:35:02.520" style="s2">concluded that I was a solid stage 14</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.220" end="00:35:05.069" style="s2">paradigm attic on the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.520" end="00:35:06.869" style="s2">complexity scale so just for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.069" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">listeners paradigmatic being the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.869" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">after meta systemic yeah and I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:15.690" style="s2">definitely not a stage 15 so I said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:18.900" style="s2">solid middle stage 14 but in terms of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.690" end="00:35:21.510" style="s2">code proudly modernist right in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.900" end="00:35:23.400" style="s2">mentioned spiral dynamics and something</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.510" end="00:35:25.619" style="s2">I&#39;ve been known to say and post on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.400" end="00:35:28.170" style="s2">internet is when I think of spiral</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.619" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">dynamics I think of it as an arch not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.170" end="00:35:32.820" style="s2">spiral</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">the top is orange to the left blue and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.820" end="00:35:38.310" style="s2">red is increasing ignorance to the right</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.640" end="00:35:42.120" style="s2">green turquoise all that is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.310" end="00:35:45.000" style="s2">goofiness or hate so I don&#39;t see this as</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.120" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">a progression right I see it as gone off</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:49.170" style="s2">the wrong track goddamn it right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:51.360" style="s2">in fact I guess I would call myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.170" end="00:35:54.090" style="s2">modern plus because I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.360" end="00:35:56.430" style="s2">other ways that modernism can branch but</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.090" end="00:35:58.410" style="s2">not through post-modernism so what are</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.430" end="00:36:02.790" style="s2">your thoughts about a person who was</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.410" end="00:36:04.830" style="s2">stage 14 in hierarchical complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.790" end="00:36:07.140" style="s2">was kind of rejected the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.830" end="00:36:08.670" style="s2">postmodern and meta moderate I got an</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:10.440" style="s2">open mind out I might a minor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.670" end="00:36:13.400" style="s2">interesting but I definitely reject the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.440" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">postmodern code kit as actually useful</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.400" end="00:36:17.550" style="s2">also before we get your answer that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">also going to mention something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.550" end="00:36:21.840" style="s2">been involved with for a number of years</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:24.390" style="s2">is something called game B which is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.840" end="00:36:27.290" style="s2">radical social change theory and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.390" end="00:36:29.460" style="s2">philosophy and now a more ever more so</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.290" end="00:36:35.060" style="s2">practical group which can be found on</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.460" end="00:36:38.970" style="s2">facebook at the game B G am EB group and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.060" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">the equivalent I would say of your</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.970" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">stages or code is what we call deep code</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.460" end="00:36:45.960" style="s2">most of it developed by a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:49.080" style="s2">Jordan Hall formerly known as Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.960" end="00:36:52.350" style="s2">green Hall and I would say at least in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.080" end="00:36:54.630" style="s2">my mind that it is a fork from modernity</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.350" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">to something at least at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.630" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">meta modernism and yet actively is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:03.590" style="s2">choose post-modernism huh all right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:06.350" style="s2">this is a very interesting question and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.590" end="00:37:08.820" style="s2">roughly speaking the only answer is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.350" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">AHA this kind of development once you</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.820" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">understand house for dimensions and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:15.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t even get into the second two</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:18.740" style="s2">which are more subjective dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.590" end="00:37:21.870" style="s2">then we see that it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.740" end="00:37:26.010" style="s2">nonlinear than we think and it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.870" end="00:37:28.410" style="s2">have a lot of unexpected dynamics to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.010" end="00:37:31.290" style="s2">so let&#39;s see modernist</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.410" end="00:37:33.150" style="s2">paradigmatic all right so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.290" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">we might of course always be wrong when</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.150" end="00:37:37.620" style="s2">we self evaluate but given your</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:39.570" style="s2">background and so on it would make sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.620" end="00:37:42.330" style="s2">that you would be at paradigmatic and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.570" end="00:37:44.580" style="s2">also talked to you before the show</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.330" end="00:37:48.060" style="s2">started and that would make sense yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.580" end="00:37:50.760" style="s2">that being said the reason that we may</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:53.160" style="s2">reject post-modernism there may be any</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.760" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">number of reasons that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:58.860" style="s2">the angle through which this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:38:01.890" style="s2">presented to us it may have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.860" end="00:38:05.850" style="s2">the other two dimensions which are depth</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.890" end="00:38:09.540" style="s2">and state things that play on subtleties</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.850" end="00:38:12.270" style="s2">that we may not be in tune with might</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.540" end="00:38:15.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say go over our heads and we we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.270" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">might not see them and for this reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.360" end="00:38:21.030" style="s2">people may be saying things that mean in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">terms of subtlety and their spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.030" end="00:38:27.030" style="s2">dimensions things that aren&#39;t available</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:29.990" style="s2">to us and looking at these effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.030" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">ally memes they are emergent patterns</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.990" end="00:38:37.170" style="s2">within all of these four dimensions so</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.810" end="00:38:40.350" style="s2">they&#39;re a kind of sum but as it some is</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.170" end="00:38:42.360" style="s2">the wrong word they&#39;re a kind of a dance</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.350" end="00:38:44.910" style="s2">between these four developmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.360" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">dimensions so our subjective state in</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.910" end="00:38:49.950" style="s2">every moment the existential depth that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:38:53.610" style="s2">we have developed in our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.950" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">existence and the complexity of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.610" end="00:38:58.170" style="s2">thought processes and behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:39:00.120" style="s2">whatever symbols we have available so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.170" end="00:39:02.010" style="s2">you come across a bunch of symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.120" end="00:39:04.980" style="s2">you don&#39;t like them there can be any</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.010" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">number of reasons for why these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.980" end="00:39:09.450" style="s2">perhaps or didn&#39;t represent let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">the real post-modernism on the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:16.830" style="s2">hand you come across meta modern ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:21.030" style="s2">which superficially to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.830" end="00:39:23.400" style="s2">actually modernists to an actual let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.030" end="00:39:25.260" style="s2">say orange modernist there wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.400" end="00:39:27.540" style="s2">appear to be a difference between my</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.260" end="00:39:30.030" style="s2">writing and all the Foucault stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.540" end="00:39:31.950" style="s2">there I see it radically different but</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.030" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">anyway I continue but if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.950" end="00:39:35.370" style="s2">prisons reactions on the web people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:36.980" style="s2">are modernist</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.370" end="00:39:39.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t see any difference between</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.980" end="00:39:41.490" style="s2">post-modernism a meta modernism to them</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.630" end="00:39:43.620" style="s2">well this is also somebody talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.490" end="00:39:45.510" style="s2">structures they&#39;re also about social</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.620" end="00:39:47.390" style="s2">justice they&#39;re also about critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.510" end="00:39:50.220" style="s2">modern society they&#39;re also about</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.390" end="00:39:52.410" style="s2">touchy-feely stuff about inner things</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.220" end="00:39:55.020" style="s2">and and they&#39;re they&#39;re revolting</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.410" end="00:39:57.930" style="s2">against everyday life stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.020" end="00:40:00.630" style="s2">being normal and invest in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.930" end="00:40:03.810" style="s2">getting a villa and a job than all that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.630" end="00:40:07.380" style="s2">stuff so on a superficial level if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.810" end="00:40:09.660" style="s2">are actually at the modern value meme</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.380" end="00:40:12.060" style="s2">then you wouldn&#39;t resonate with what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.660" end="00:40:15.330" style="s2">write you would find it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.060" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">indistinguishable from post-modernism so</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.330" end="00:40:22.500" style="s2">most likely you simply had like an</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:26.310" style="s2">allergic reaction and then you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.500" end="00:40:28.230" style="s2">see any other alternatives around so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.310" end="00:40:30.600" style="s2">just saw okay I&#39;ll just hang out here</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.230" end="00:40:33.180" style="s2">for a while because I still believe in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.600" end="00:40:36.630" style="s2">science who doesn&#39;t and I can see these</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.180" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">people are getting into culture wars and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.630" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">and identity politics and I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:45.090" style="s2">that and I feel I don&#39;t get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:47.190" style="s2">truth and and direction when I see their</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.090" end="00:40:50.910" style="s2">critiques of science and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.190" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">probably you also got not very fair</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.910" end="00:40:56.460" style="s2">representation of real postmodern ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">which actually do hold up against the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.460" end="00:41:01.530" style="s2">modern ones if you go to the core of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:03.690" style="s2">them postmodern ideas per definition are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.530" end="00:41:06.210" style="s2">the ones the modern worldview will lead</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.690" end="00:41:08.790" style="s2">you towards which is the the argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.210" end="00:41:10.790" style="s2">that I make in listening society that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.790" end="00:41:13.310" style="s2">that the symbol stage is modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.790" end="00:41:16.710" style="s2">postmodern meta modern are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.310" end="00:41:18.359" style="s2">arbitrarily ordered that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.710" end="00:41:20.850" style="s2">modern ideas if you take them to their</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.359" end="00:41:22.650" style="s2">utmost conclusion they will collapse</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.850" end="00:41:25.050" style="s2">under their own weight and they will</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.650" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">leave you to postmodern conclusions but</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.050" end="00:41:31.020" style="s2">the postmodern ideas when you take those</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:32.850" style="s2">to their ultimate point they collapse</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.020" end="00:41:34.500" style="s2">under their weight and they lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.850" end="00:41:37.109" style="s2">meta modern conclusions which seemed</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.500" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">counterintuitive and even heretical to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.109" end="00:41:42.060" style="s2">the postmodern mind and if you already</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.330" style="s2">were a complex thinker and you only had</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.060" end="00:41:47.100" style="s2">modern ideas and postmodern ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.330" end="00:41:49.260" style="s2">terms of complexity and so on these</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.100" end="00:41:51.510" style="s2">ideas tend to resonate with meta</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.260" end="00:41:54.180" style="s2">modernism but it you only had these to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.510" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">choose from and you could see that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.180" end="00:41:59.070" style="s2">postmodern ideas and often they&#39;re in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:42:01.320" style="s2">misused forms that they were distasteful</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.070" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">to you then you simply rejected them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.320" end="00:42:05.460" style="s2">then you were frustrated with them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy you were here talking to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.460" end="00:42:09.569" style="s2">me instead of taking the route</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:12.359" style="s2">that so many of our good friends have</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.569" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2">done these days and it&#39;s to say I hate</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.359" end="00:42:15.930" style="s2">post-modernism I hate postmoderns I hate</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">postmark so then they wake up the next</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.930" end="00:42:20.609" style="s2">morning and they say I hate post</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:22.770" style="s2">modernist three times again and it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.609" end="00:42:24.990" style="s2">goes on for years and after a while they</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.770" end="00:42:28.470" style="s2">say I hate it so much I don&#39;t even care</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.990" end="00:42:30.089" style="s2">about all of those ideas and ideals and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.470" end="00:42:32.040" style="s2">social justice things they&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.089" end="00:42:34.740" style="s2">up so actually I do want to kill the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.040" end="00:42:37.050" style="s2">immigrants and actually I do want men to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.740" end="00:42:39.329" style="s2">rule women and actually I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.050" end="00:42:41.010" style="s2">democracy and actually some smart person</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.329" end="00:42:43.950" style="s2">should create some order in this world</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.010" end="00:42:45.450" style="s2">and actually the military isn&#39;t so bad</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.820" end="00:45:19.829" style="s2">useful and I never found anything in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:22.109" style="s2">post-modernism that would actually let</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.829" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">us build a better world reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.109" end="00:45:26.130" style="s2">expeditiously it just seemed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:28.650" style="s2">swamp in which there was no getting out</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:31.710" style="s2">while meta monetarism does not have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.650" end="00:45:34.349" style="s2">smell and nor does game be deep code and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.710" end="00:45:37.380" style="s2">so I guess I would say it&#39;s at least it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.349" end="00:45:39.780" style="s2">seems to me possible that one can get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.380" end="00:45:43.319" style="s2">you know how to build a much better</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.780" end="00:45:47.010" style="s2">world that is guys much more justice</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.319" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">operates it avoids the self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:50.760" style="s2">loop that our current game a is caught</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.990" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">in etc without having to go through</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.760" end="00:45:54.690" style="s2">post-modernism but I suspect we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">have to agree to disagree about that one</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.690" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">I suppose I mean just saying a few</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:01.609" style="s2">things that are useful about</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.520" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">in a structured manner is the essence of</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.990" end="00:47:30.840" style="s2">and the postmodern mind will deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.950" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">that interest or it will expose it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.840" end="00:47:36.420" style="s2">it will be able to end to compare it to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">other forms of interest and then it will</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.420" end="00:47:40.740" style="s2">show you that what you thought was</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">useful or perhaps not as useful as you</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:22.110" style="s2">interesting the same rule is there for</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:24.510" style="s2">the post modernist today we will use the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.110" end="00:51:27.020" style="s2">post modernists populations for a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.510" end="00:51:29.970" style="s2">of moral mobilization but it is only</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.020" end="00:51:33.240" style="s2">possible within the institutions and</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.240" end="00:51:37.050" style="s2">like that actually I like that because</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.160" end="00:51:40.140" style="s2">then you get away from this swamp of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.050" end="00:51:42.510" style="s2">inability to make any decisions I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.140" end="00:51:44.670" style="s2">just how do you pray again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.510" end="00:51:46.470" style="s2">again and nothing happened or go to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.670" end="00:51:48.270" style="s2">another comment or whatever and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.470" end="00:51:49.860" style="s2">postmodern is just gonna have you go to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.270" end="00:51:51.150" style="s2">the University and writing the critique</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.860" end="00:51:53.550" style="s2">of the critique of the critique and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.150" end="00:51:55.770" style="s2">that&#39;s it exactly so yeah if we think</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.550" end="00:51:57.780" style="s2">about that way it&#39;s in general you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.770" end="00:52:00.300" style="s2">I am and I would say the game be deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.780" end="00:52:03.080" style="s2">code is you know strongly in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.300" end="00:52:06.450" style="s2">egalitarianism the elimination of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.080" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">bigotry and Prejudice Equal Opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.450" end="00:52:11.850" style="s2">etcetera etc so I think at the Values</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:14.430" style="s2">level fairly similar but the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.850" end="00:52:16.110" style="s2">just seems so goofy I have no</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.430" end="00:52:17.640" style="s2">interest in going down there so but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.110" end="00:52:19.350" style="s2">like you&#39;re right I like your presenting</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.640" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">it let&#39;s let them say that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.350" end="00:52:25.890" style="s2">developed a useful set of morals but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:27.510" style="s2">let&#39;s ignore their methods and let them</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.890" end="00:52:29.310" style="s2">play with their methods and let them</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.510" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">write their morals and then we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.310" end="00:52:33.210" style="s2">the morals and we&#39;ll go put them to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:36.750" style="s2">goddammit I I wouldn&#39;t go as far as</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.210" end="00:52:38.340" style="s2">ignore I&#39;d say use them and put them in</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.750" end="00:52:40.410" style="s2">their proper place and don&#39;t let them</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.340" end="00:52:42.180" style="s2">stop you from doing your stuff okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.410" end="00:52:43.650" style="s2">let&#39;s gets good I actually learned</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.180" end="00:52:45.900" style="s2">something there good that actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.650" end="00:52:47.790" style="s2">improved my mental working kit a little</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.900" end="00:52:49.020" style="s2">bit I still don&#39;t like post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.790" end="00:52:51.870" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna think about it a little</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.020" end="00:52:53.940" style="s2">bit differently now let&#39;s get back to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.870" end="00:52:56.070" style="s2">couple other more detailed points one</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.940" end="00:52:59.010" style="s2">which i think is very important here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.070" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">direct quote from listening the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.010" end="00:53:05.580" style="s2">goes for meta Modern code which only</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:09.540" style="s2">less than 2% have the cognitive hardware</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.580" end="00:53:11.810" style="s2">that&#39;s your word to operate successfully</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.540" end="00:53:16.620" style="s2">this might be an insurmountable problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.810" end="00:53:19.560" style="s2">to meta modernism if Hardware less than</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.620" end="00:53:22.230" style="s2">2% can run meta modern code how can you</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.560" end="00:53:24.840" style="s2">ever get it to work yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.230" end="00:53:27.810" style="s2">and so I mean just to get back on what</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.840" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">I&#39;m saying there in the book that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.810" end="00:53:31.320" style="s2">the reason a lot of people hate</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:33.900" style="s2">postmodern is so much is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.320" end="00:53:36.660" style="s2">relatively sophisticated is not about</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.900" end="00:53:39.120" style="s2">yelling at men for them making a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.660" end="00:53:42.440" style="s2">bit more money or or shaming somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.120" end="00:53:44.790" style="s2">for writing hi girls instead of hi</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.440" end="00:53:47.760" style="s2">vagina bearers or so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.790" end="00:53:50.430" style="s2">it&#39;s actually about structural critiques</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.760" end="00:53:53.580" style="s2">which requires systematic staged</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.430" end="00:53:55.560" style="s2">thinking to be done properly and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.580" end="00:53:58.050" style="s2">have to actually see systems you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.560" end="00:54:00.420" style="s2">see cultures as objects and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.050" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">look at them dispassionately and so on</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.420" end="00:54:05.370" style="s2">which is difficult to do and not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:07.140" style="s2">of adult people can do it where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.370" end="00:54:09.630" style="s2">people can do it but just about 20% of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.140" end="00:54:12.270" style="s2">the population and then following the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.630" end="00:54:14.520" style="s2">research by Commons if you look at how</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.270" end="00:54:17.670" style="s2">many people reason at the meta systemic</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.520" end="00:54:20.760" style="s2">stage it&#39;s about 1.8 percent and then if</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.670" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">you go down to paradigmatic its we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.760" end="00:54:25.110" style="s2">know but if it follows the same normal</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:26.730" style="s2">distribution it&#39;s going to be one in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.110" end="00:54:29.840" style="s2">thousand or thereabout or a couple in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.730" end="00:54:33.450" style="s2">thousand and if you then look at this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.840" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">aha meta modernism what what are we</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.450" end="00:54:37.830" style="s2">doing here we&#39;re looking at inner</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:39.270" style="s2">development and the different subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.830" end="00:54:40.500" style="s2">of in your development and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.270" end="00:54:42.590" style="s2">putting together different subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.500" end="00:54:46.680" style="s2">and your development some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.590" end="00:54:48.090" style="s2">sociological II built or constructed</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.680" end="00:54:50.700" style="s2">meaning that the inner development</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.090" end="00:54:52.500" style="s2">defense on outer development and then we</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.700" end="00:54:54.450" style="s2">have to create institutions for that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.500" end="00:54:56.310" style="s2">then we have to coordinate that with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.450" end="00:54:58.050" style="s2">people who create those institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.310" end="00:54:59.730" style="s2">so on we&#39;re in the space of meta</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.050" end="00:55:02.220" style="s2">systemic thought processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.730" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;re in complex thought processes and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.220" end="00:55:08.760" style="s2">if you try to use a kind of code you</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:11.550" style="s2">kind of run a complex code in a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.760" end="00:55:13.740" style="s2">form and this is having many many many</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.550" end="00:55:16.560" style="s2">times in history from religion to</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.740" end="00:55:18.660" style="s2">political ideologies to scientific</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.560" end="00:55:22.140" style="s2">theories and so on they get simplified</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.660" end="00:55:23.660" style="s2">when they&#39;re popularized so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.140" end="00:55:27.749" style="s2">if you run</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.660" end="00:55:30.089" style="s2">then a modern code on a lower stage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.749" end="00:55:32.759" style="s2">cognitive complexity well what happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.089" end="00:55:35.309" style="s2">is you get flattened versions of it so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.759" end="00:55:38.219" style="s2">you get versions are going to look a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.309" end="00:55:41.249" style="s2">surface level a lot like meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.219" end="00:55:44.519" style="s2">politics or or have the same goals or</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.249" end="00:55:47.190" style="s2">ideals or norms but they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.519" end="00:55:50.069" style="s2">going to work they&#39;re going to produce</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.190" end="00:55:52.019" style="s2">lots of pathologies so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.069" end="00:55:53.940" style="s2">people will say okay listening society</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.019" end="00:55:55.410" style="s2">so it&#39;s good to always take in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.940" end="00:55:57.569" style="s2">perspectives of others and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.410" end="00:56:00.509" style="s2">spend a lifetime just taking in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.569" end="00:56:01.949" style="s2">perspectives of crazy people and not</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.509" end="00:56:04.859" style="s2">being able to coordinate them for</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.949" end="00:56:06.509" style="s2">instance or they will think AHA so there</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.779" end="00:57:29.999" style="s2">my theory and I made sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.380" end="00:57:31.709" style="s2">gonna be read in the right way and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.999" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">made sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.709" end="00:57:35.170" style="s2">I made sure that my subconscious didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.170" end="00:57:41.770" style="s2">was aware of that that Sofia steered my</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.770" end="00:57:45.819" style="s2">absolutely it is what it is yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.140" end="00:57:48.339" style="s2">so it is what it is and but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.819" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">hand what else to do I mean should we</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.339" end="00:57:52.390" style="s2">should we stop thinking about theories</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:55.480" style="s2">about where we want to go as a society</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.390" end="00:57:58.299" style="s2">or what the state should look like or</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.480" end="00:58:00.760" style="s2">what the market should look like and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.299" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">welfare systems and so on I mean because</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.760" end="00:58:04.630" style="s2">it&#39;s too dangerous and only</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:07.030" style="s2">megalomaniacs would do that so then</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.630" end="00:58:08.950" style="s2">nobody&#39;s allowed to ever to ever have an</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.030" end="00:58:10.869" style="s2">opinion on it that that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.950" end="00:58:12.250" style="s2">yeah but nevertheless that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.869" end="00:58:14.589" style="s2">liberal mainstream will tell us they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.250" end="00:58:15.790" style="s2">say no we don&#39;t want your theory because</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.589" end="00:58:18.910" style="s2">it&#39;s totalitarian and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.790" end="00:58:20.980" style="s2">megalomaniac for even daring to take it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.910" end="00:58:23.559" style="s2">upon yourself to answer such questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.980" end="00:58:25.809" style="s2">aha so your plan is nobody answers the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.559" end="00:58:28.119" style="s2">questions and we all die yep exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.809" end="00:58:30.339" style="s2">I dent achill to our game B issue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.119" end="00:58:32.710" style="s2">amazing how similar that is because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.339" end="00:58:35.380" style="s2">know we basically say that we are on a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.710" end="00:58:37.960" style="s2">self terminating curve period if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.380" end="00:58:39.640" style="s2">don&#39;t change our ways right and yet when</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.960" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">we propose these radical techniques</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.640" end="00:58:44.349" style="s2">people say you&#39;re nuts this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:46.900" style="s2">communism or this is fashion is emerge</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.349" end="00:58:48.930" style="s2">both communism plus fascism and so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.900" end="00:58:51.549" style="s2">sounds like we all have the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.930" end="00:58:54.460" style="s2">interesting problem which neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.549" end="00:58:56.920" style="s2">have saw absolutely say game B is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.460" end="00:58:58.920" style="s2">solve this which is how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.920" end="00:59:02.020" style="s2">what you called the flattened version</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.920" end="00:59:04.059" style="s2">that actually resonates with people and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.020" end="00:59:07.240" style="s2">ones you were saying that an image came</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.059" end="00:59:11.230" style="s2">to my mind which is my grandmother long</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.240" end="00:59:14.500" style="s2">since deceased was Irish and a fervent</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.230" end="00:59:16.930" style="s2">Catholic it went to Mass every day all</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.500" end="00:59:19.270" style="s2">right celebrated the saint days every</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.930" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">day of the year a very Catholic but her</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.270" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">Catholicism was very shallow nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:28.780" style="s2">like Thomas Aquinas --is right but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.760" end="00:59:31.569" style="s2">somehow it satisfied her as an ape with</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.780" end="00:59:33.910" style="s2">clothes right as a resonating human</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.569" end="00:59:35.770" style="s2">living in her body and her mind she</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.910" end="00:59:38.380" style="s2">loved her Catholicism more than she</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.770" end="00:59:40.859" style="s2">loved her own kids truthfully so there</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.380" end="00:59:44.099" style="s2">was an example of a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.859" end="00:59:47.470" style="s2">flattening from let&#39;s say Aquinas or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.099" end="00:59:48.940" style="s2">19th century version of Aquinas to my</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.470" end="00:59:50.890" style="s2">mother&#39;s Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.940" end="00:59:53.530" style="s2">so I guess I would throw that out to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.890" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">and your collaborators as something you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.530" end="00:59:58.660" style="s2">need to figure out is a flattening of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">meta modernism that&#39;s is attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.660" end="01:00:03.480" style="s2">people today as a flattened version of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">Catholicism was to my grandmother in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.480" end="01:00:06.790" style="s2">1930</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:08.710" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t over emphasized the need for</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.790" end="01:00:10.690" style="s2">popularization with most of all we need</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.710" end="01:00:14.339" style="s2">to find the right people and we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.690" end="01:00:18.250" style="s2">affect the knowledge generation</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.339" end="01:00:20.170" style="s2">trajectories of let&#39;s say actually just</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.250" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">a few hundred people around the world at</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.170" end="01:00:26.490" style="s2">this point meaning that for us to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:29.109" style="s2">serious change happen we need people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.490" end="01:00:31.750" style="s2">seriously work over the long time and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.109" end="01:00:34.780" style="s2">commit their lives to some kind of meta</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.750" end="01:00:38.260" style="s2">Modern / call it whatever game change</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.780" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">and seriously will consider plans and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.260" end="01:00:45.130" style="s2">take risks with their own lives to play</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.250" end="01:00:47.500" style="s2">parts in these plans and who are</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.130" end="01:00:50.829" style="s2">prepared to learn a million new things</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.500" end="01:00:53.170" style="s2">while doing this and to do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.829" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">coordinated manner with other people</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.170" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">because without these core groups I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:02.380" style="s2">we can have all the popular demands for</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:03.700" style="s2">a listing society we want new forms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.380" end="01:01:07.089" style="s2">politics or whatever the things</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.700" end="01:01:09.069" style="s2">suggested in my books but without some</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.089" end="01:01:11.730" style="s2">people who were actually doing the hard</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.069" end="01:01:13.540" style="s2">work and carrying the brunt of it and</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.730" end="01:01:15.790" style="s2">coordinating and resonating with one</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.540" end="01:01:19.300" style="s2">another it&#39;s just not going to happen so</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.790" end="01:01:21.640" style="s2">that&#39;s number one part and you know from</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.300" end="01:01:24.550" style="s2">there on the the popularization is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.640" end="01:01:27.540" style="s2">secondary concern because first of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.550" end="01:01:30.490" style="s2">we need to actually start to affect</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.540" end="01:01:33.520" style="s2">institutions and political games and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.490" end="01:01:36.579" style="s2">markets out there and knowledge creation</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.520" end="01:01:38.920" style="s2">processes I think if we got a flattened</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.579" end="01:01:40.569" style="s2">version that was truly attractive it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.920" end="01:01:42.970" style="s2">would actually aid in that tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.569" end="01:01:45.130" style="s2">imagine if there were a flattened</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.970" end="01:01:48.579" style="s2">version of meta modernism that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.130" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">attractive to 20% of the population as</p>

<p begin="01:02:02.260" end="01:02:07.930" style="s2">you asked me before 2% of the population</p>

<p begin="01:02:07.930" end="01:02:14.920" style="s2">and this appear is to be at least partly</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.310" end="01:02:35.550" style="s2">prefer to I feel reassured when people</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.790" end="01:02:39.270" style="s2">are a little bit more conservative and</p>

<p begin="01:02:39.270" end="01:02:44.920" style="s2">and just stay with more common-sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.040" end="01:02:47.380" style="s2">stuff because things get really crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.920" end="01:02:49.840" style="s2">really fast even in highly intelligent</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.780" end="01:03:09.400" style="s2">people and a lot of have a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:03:09.400" end="01:03:14.560" style="s2">of medications because it&#39;s unusual</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.140" end="01:03:18.070" style="s2">people and sensitive people so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.560" end="01:03:21.340" style="s2">what I see today is that I&#39;m not overly</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.210" end="01:03:38.920" style="s2">important part is to respect</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.259" end="01:05:46.239" style="s2">right and I&#39;m with you I am terrified of</p>

<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:06.940" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like that we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.210" end="01:07:09.130" style="s2">need a conspiracy or yes we do do need a</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.940" end="01:07:11.980" style="s2">conspiracy we just needed to be boring</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.130" end="01:07:14.230" style="s2">enough for people not to care and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.980" end="01:07:16.870" style="s2">basically they can&#39;t stop us so it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.050" end="01:08:26.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve converged on some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.430" end="01:08:28.780" style="s2">tactics so this is very enlightening</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.740" end="01:08:30.760" style="s2">interesting part of the discussion let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.780" end="01:08:33.339" style="s2">move on to the next piece in The</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.760" end="01:08:36.010" style="s2">Listening Society the word spiritual or</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.339" end="01:08:38.620" style="s2">spirituality occurred a hundred and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.010" end="01:08:40.420" style="s2">seventy-six times and as people who</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.620" end="01:08:42.720" style="s2">listen to the show know I hate the word</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.420" end="01:08:46.950" style="s2">spiritual and spirituality and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.720" end="01:08:48.690" style="s2">they usually call it the S word and so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.950" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">want to know what what is spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.690" end="01:08:53.010" style="s2">to you and why is it relevant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:55.070" style="s2">refreshing to get this question Jim you</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.010" end="01:08:57.600" style="s2">know because when I speak to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.070" end="01:08:59.970" style="s2">integralists they always ask me why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:04.650" style="s2">so secular on is a critical spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.970" end="01:09:06.210" style="s2">and you you hate me from the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.650" end="01:09:07.950" style="s2">directions I would</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.210" end="01:09:10.710" style="s2">why do you included so much why are you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.950" end="01:09:12.630" style="s2">obsessing about it and basically yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.710" end="01:09:14.670" style="s2">spirituality is important because in</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.630" end="01:09:17.700" style="s2">some sense the religions were right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.670" end="01:09:20.970" style="s2">when modern society happened we of</p>

<p begin="01:10:57.429" end="01:11:03.429" style="s2">philosophy remain stream textbooks this</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.190" end="01:11:06.639" style="s2">impetus of philosophy isn&#39;t present I</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.429" end="01:11:08.590" style="s2">mean they never take this seriously</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.639" end="01:11:10.540" style="s2">enough and discuss it but philosophy is</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.590" end="01:11:13.659" style="s2">driven by high complexity people but</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.540" end="01:11:16.690" style="s2">also by people experiencing high</p>

<p begin="01:11:20.380" end="01:11:27.730" style="s2">itself which bring them to completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.150" end="01:11:29.909" style="s2">new conclusions about the existence of</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.730" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">reality I mean this is described in</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.909" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">Descartes he sits by the fire and he and</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:37.449" style="s2">he has this great insight it this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:40.900" style="s2">spiritual experience that he that he</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.449" end="01:11:44.199" style="s2">describes in his biography here it just</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.900" end="01:11:47.830" style="s2">goes back all the way and it goes back</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.199" end="01:11:51.010" style="s2">to Plato it goes back actually yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.830" end="01:11:52.929" style="s2">bit less in science then science seems</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.010" end="01:11:54.969" style="s2">to be a little bit less driven by this</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.929" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">spiritual impetus but philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.969" end="01:12:01.179" style="s2">definitely all of the religions which</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">have had compelling images and stories</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.179" end="01:12:06.580" style="s2">that people have built their meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">making structures around all come from</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.580" end="01:12:11.350" style="s2">these exceptionally high states which</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:15.159" style="s2">also connect us often some notion of</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.350" end="01:12:17.500" style="s2">Terror or hell or or the seriousness of</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.159" end="01:12:21.070" style="s2">the matter of existence that suffering</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.500" end="01:12:22.929" style="s2">is real and very very very very profound</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.070" end="01:12:24.760" style="s2">and very very very grim suffering is</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.929" end="01:12:26.650" style="s2">possible suffering beyond our</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.760" end="01:12:28.840" style="s2">imagination and then we have to think</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.650" end="01:12:30.429" style="s2">take the spiritual struggle to get out</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.840" end="01:12:32.860" style="s2">of that suffering very very very</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.429" end="01:12:36.940" style="s2">seriously to go to heaven or not to hell</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.860" end="01:12:38.949" style="s2">or to well so in some general sense the</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.940" end="01:12:40.630" style="s2">religions weren&#39;t wrong and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.949" end="01:12:42.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a big difference then between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.630" end="01:12:44.230" style="s2">meta modern mind and the modern mind</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.310" end="01:12:46.780" style="s2">them the meta modern mind says okay sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.230" end="01:12:48.460" style="s2">Jesus didn&#39;t walk on water and Moses</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.780" end="01:12:51.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually part the sea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.460" end="01:12:53.530" style="s2">crazy talk of course and and of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.190" end="01:12:55.690" style="s2">Galileo was right and of course people</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.530" end="01:13:00.610" style="s2">of the Inquisition shouldn&#39;t have gone</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.690" end="01:13:04.630" style="s2">after him but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.610" end="01:13:06.940" style="s2">contemplation isn&#39;t a powerful psycho</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.630" end="01:13:09.100" style="s2">spiritual technology and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.940" end="01:13:11.410" style="s2">that the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.100" end="01:13:14.530" style="s2">ideas that we have about consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.410" end="01:13:17.350" style="s2">etc in a k-12 school which is basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.530" end="01:13:20.010" style="s2">nothing they just kind of avoid the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.350" end="01:13:22.150" style="s2">question and that the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.010" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">assumption is some kind of materialist</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.150" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">reduction is that these things may be</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:31.960" style="s2">wrong and more spiritual views views</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.960" end="01:13:34.060" style="s2">that are informed by these higher states</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.960" end="01:13:36.750" style="s2">and the in the kinds of reasoning that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.060" end="01:13:41.140" style="s2">flow from these higher states may be</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.750" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">more irrelevant to describing the nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.140" end="01:13:47.380" style="s2">of reality and thus our place in it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:49.480" style="s2">thus how we can and should act within it</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.380" end="01:13:52.350" style="s2">and relate to it and relate to one</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.480" end="01:13:55.180" style="s2">another and to ourselves and so on so</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.350" end="01:13:57.220" style="s2">because these things are real because</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.180" end="01:14:01.080" style="s2">they are present we cannot ignore them</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.220" end="01:14:04.750" style="s2">and because meta modernism then is about</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.080" end="01:14:07.240" style="s2">growth is psychological growth and an</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.750" end="01:14:09.910" style="s2">existential growth and cognitive growth</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.240" end="01:14:11.800" style="s2">and sociological growth and so on so the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.910" end="01:14:15.070" style="s2">farther stretches of human development</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.800" end="01:14:17.020" style="s2">it also pushes us into the farther</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.070" end="01:14:19.660" style="s2">stretches of existential development and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.020" end="01:14:23.260" style="s2">that pushes us beyond the reaches of</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.660" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">everyday life consciousness or states of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.260" end="01:14:28.930" style="s2">awareness into these unusual or altered</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:32.860" style="s2">states of awareness did you read this</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.930" end="01:14:36.340" style="s2">book is by I know you read a lot on</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.860" end="01:14:41.470" style="s2">consciousness and I have a favorite very</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.340" end="01:14:43.780" style="s2">recent one by a British journalist and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.470" end="01:14:47.380" style="s2">don&#39;t remember the name is the name of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.780" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">the journalist he&#39;s in The Guardian but</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.380" end="01:14:53.290" style="s2">he he wrote a book called am I dreaming</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:55.750" style="s2">and it describes all the latest research</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.290" end="01:14:58.660" style="s2">on these altered states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.750" end="01:15:01.720" style="s2">and then he takes an ayahuasca trip and</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.660" end="01:15:02.950" style="s2">trip and stuff like that and what he</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.720" end="01:15:05.710" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.950" end="01:15:07.990" style="s2">is that the red thread or I mean the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.710" end="01:15:10.450" style="s2">connecting wood connects the dots here</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.990" end="01:15:13.240" style="s2">is that when we are in the high states</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.450" end="01:15:16.390" style="s2">of awareness or or I mean those blissful</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.240" end="01:15:19.360" style="s2">open states of psychedelic States and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.390" end="01:15:22.410" style="s2">on all the neurons fire I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.360" end="01:15:25.770" style="s2">like a connections are made in a much</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.410" end="01:15:28.370" style="s2">wider sense and then it&#39;s like a reset</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.770" end="01:15:31.800" style="s2">button for the brain so that this</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.370" end="01:15:34.470" style="s2">structures can change radically in these</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.800" end="01:15:36.360" style="s2">moments let me cut to push back on this</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.470" end="01:15:39.120" style="s2">a little bit just for our audience</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.360" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">I believe the book is am I dreaming by</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.120" end="01:15:43.290" style="s2">James Kingsland does that sound right</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:45.720" style="s2">yes yes it looks very interesting I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.290" end="01:15:47.490" style="s2">not read it but I will and I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.720" end="01:15:49.230" style="s2">forth that I actually have seemed to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.490" end="01:15:51.420" style="s2">an amount of experience with these</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.230" end="01:15:54.810" style="s2">higher end altered states I&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.420" end="01:15:57.300" style="s2">done heavy psychedelics six or seven</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.810" end="01:16:00.210" style="s2">times milder psychedelics a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.300" end="01:16:04.080" style="s2">times I&#39;ve done quite a bit of bio</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.210" end="01:16:06.150" style="s2">neurofeedback oriented excursions I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.080" end="01:16:08.460" style="s2">easily put myself into a mystical state</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.150" end="01:16:10.230" style="s2">for five or ten seconds it&#39;s kind of fun</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.460" end="01:16:12.150" style="s2">I can do it for a longer period of time</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.230" end="01:16:15.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more work I can put anybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.150" end="01:16:17.640" style="s2">into a mystical state give me 36 hours</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.540" end="01:16:20.970" style="s2">so anyway I know these things are real</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.640" end="01:16:22.980" style="s2">and I&#39;ve had these experiences and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.970" end="01:16:25.140" style="s2">even heard the song all right which I</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.980" end="01:16:27.000" style="s2">have reached by various of these methods</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.140" end="01:16:30.390" style="s2">this song with no words it&#39;s but has</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.000" end="01:16:32.790" style="s2">words it&#39;s very weird however my</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.510" end="01:19:02.010" style="s2">altered states are essentially the</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.050" end="01:19:13.320" style="s2">words it&#39;s a fairly similar to those</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.160" end="01:19:15.630" style="s2">computer-generated story systems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.320" end="01:19:17.820" style="s2">using a you know a bunch of algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.630" end="01:19:20.100" style="s2">that can generate a story that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.820" end="01:19:22.500" style="s2">okay as a story but it&#39;s just generated</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.100" end="01:19:25.070" style="s2">randomly and that may be all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.500" end="01:19:27.810" style="s2">that we&#39;re experiencing as depth is</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.070" end="01:19:30.030" style="s2">unusual networks plus the confabulate ER</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.810" end="01:19:32.940" style="s2">and so that we should enjoy them</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.030" end="01:19:34.469" style="s2">I do enjoy them and when you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.940" end="01:19:37.080" style="s2">something that I find that it&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.469" end="01:19:39.630" style="s2">useful for me is to break the circuit</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.080" end="01:19:41.730" style="s2">you know I found that these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.630" end="01:19:43.980" style="s2">experiences about once every six weeks</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.730" end="01:19:46.410" style="s2">were perfect they used to be back when I</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.980" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">was working real hard I&#39;d roll myself a</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.410" end="01:19:49.680" style="s2">big wad of joints and smoke as much</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:51.740" style="s2">marijuana is like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.680" end="01:19:54.870" style="s2">tolerate about once every six weeks and</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.740" end="01:19:56.130" style="s2">it was a really good reset but on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.870" end="01:19:58.290" style="s2">other hand I didn&#39;t I don&#39;t think I ever</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.130" end="01:20:01.890" style="s2">found the answer to a problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.290" end="01:20:05.100" style="s2">resultant mental states and so I wish</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.890" end="01:20:07.500" style="s2">people would not get so infatuated with</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.100" end="01:20:09.240" style="s2">these things and take them for what</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.500" end="01:20:11.370" style="s2">they&#39;re good for where they&#39;re useful</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.240" end="01:20:14.820" style="s2">but don&#39;t think that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.370" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">giving them an insight into fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.820" end="01:20:20.910" style="s2">reality itself so I mean this is really</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:23.970" style="s2">at the core of a lot of am I thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.910" end="01:20:26.670" style="s2">what I do so it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult for me</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.970" end="01:20:29.880" style="s2">to answer briefly but I&#39;m I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.670" end="01:20:32.100" style="s2">have to try to so basically I would say</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.880" end="01:20:36.320" style="s2">there are two positions which are both</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.100" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">sins here at one position is</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:46.110" style="s2">essentialism it&#39;s the ascribing of depth</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:48.570" style="s2">on to a surface and the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.110" end="01:20:50.550" style="s2">insight of post-modernism I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.570" end="01:20:52.560" style="s2">starting with Andy Warhol but it</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.550" end="01:20:54.720" style="s2">actually goes through all of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.560" end="01:20:57.420" style="s2">postmodern thinkers is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.720" end="01:21:02.010" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it is that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.420" end="01:21:05.130" style="s2">depth there is only again this goes back</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.010" end="01:21:07.470" style="s2">even to the depths of post-modernism or</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.130" end="01:21:11.360" style="s2">to the to its to its origins its roots</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.470" end="01:21:14.370" style="s2">in Dorothy talks to The Wizard of Oz it</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.360" end="01:21:17.430" style="s2">actually proto postmodern piece of</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.370" end="01:21:20.010" style="s2">literature and she says you&#39;re a bad man</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.430" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">what she discovers he&#39;s not wizard and</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.010" end="01:21:26.160" style="s2">he says I&#39;m not a bad man I&#39;m just a bad</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:29.040" style="s2">wizard aha there is always just a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.160" end="01:21:33.030" style="s2">surface always just a surface and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.040" end="01:21:34.980" style="s2">actually goes for all phenomena so right</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.030" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">now I&#39;m looking at the handle of a door</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.980" end="01:21:39.870" style="s2">and I mean in a deeper sense you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:42.060" style="s2">explain away the doorknob like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.870" end="01:21:44.010" style="s2">no doorknob it&#39;s just a piece of metal</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.060" end="01:21:45.900" style="s2">with a some plastic on it and you put it</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.010" end="01:21:49.380" style="s2">and you you you didn&#39;t think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.900" end="01:21:51.480" style="s2">doorknob here well it depends on on</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.380" end="01:21:53.790" style="s2">which level of analysis and makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.480" end="01:21:57.600" style="s2">nevertheless in my experience I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.790" end="01:21:59.220" style="s2">looking at a doorknob and there is adorn</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.600" end="01:22:01.710" style="s2">ominous to the doorknob which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.220" end="01:22:03.600" style="s2">inescapably there which is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.710" end="01:22:05.400" style="s2">experience itself</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.600" end="01:22:08.300" style="s2">in phenomenology and this brings us to</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.400" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">this other hated word of yours</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.300" end="01:22:16.520" style="s2">metaphysics it lands us in the question</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:20.430" style="s2">of metaphysics that AHA is phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.520" end="01:22:24.890" style="s2">reducible to the objective third-person</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.430" end="01:22:30.450" style="s2">parts that constituted its correlates in</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.890" end="01:22:33.750" style="s2">reality and my answer is is a yes and a</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.450" end="01:22:35.880" style="s2">no but it&#39;s mostly a no that there is</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.750" end="01:22:39.360" style="s2">just as you can make the sin of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.880" end="01:22:41.900" style="s2">essentialism saying oh I saw angels so</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.360" end="01:22:45.120" style="s2">angels are there that&#39;s essentialism</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.900" end="01:22:47.250" style="s2">another person sits down and has his or</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.120" end="01:22:49.650" style="s2">her a spiritual experience let&#39;s say</p>

<p begin="01:22:49.650" end="01:22:54.650" style="s2">fantastic happens and their their whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.020" end="01:22:58.740" style="s2">being opens up and they see the Stars</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.650" end="01:23:02.030" style="s2">boom and their partner says you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.740" end="01:23:05.580" style="s2">see the Stars your newer us fired and</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.030" end="01:23:07.140" style="s2">then you come fabulet at the Stars well</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.580" end="01:23:10.260" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take anything away from the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.140" end="01:23:12.600" style="s2">experience and what when I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.260" end="01:23:15.120" style="s2">the importance of spirituality I talked</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.600" end="01:23:18.140" style="s2">about the importance of that experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.120" end="01:23:21.090" style="s2">the that when we have those experiences</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.140" end="01:23:23.310" style="s2">there they don&#39;t feel I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.090" end="01:23:25.440" style="s2">phenomena and in a sense they aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.310" end="01:23:27.900" style="s2">more than then everything we experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.440" end="01:23:32.370" style="s2">is that the phenomenon of our</p>

<p begin="01:32:17.290" end="01:32:23.080" style="s2">a few different important groups to to</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.290" end="01:32:25.840" style="s2">meta modernism and and the different</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.080" end="01:32:29.770" style="s2">kind of landscape of class that is shown</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.840" end="01:32:32.110" style="s2">up and in post-industrial digitized</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.770" end="01:32:34.810" style="s2">internet societies and a core group you</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.110" end="01:32:36.280" style="s2">we mentioned it briefly before we also</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.810" end="01:32:38.170" style="s2">started talking the is the yoga</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.280" end="01:32:41.050" style="s2">bourgeoisie they said you&#39;re not yoga</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.170" end="01:32:44.500" style="s2">per se but is the Silicon Valley types I</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.050" end="01:32:47.440" style="s2">guess are of it and it&#39;s I suppose the</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.500" end="01:32:50.640" style="s2">core population of meta modernists these</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.440" end="01:32:52.690" style="s2">days are from the yoga bourgeoisie and</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.640" end="01:32:55.120" style="s2">especially perhaps around Burning Man</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.690" end="01:32:57.280" style="s2">culture and so on for the simple reason</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.120" end="01:32:59.950" style="s2">that okay it&#39;s somebody who went through</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.280" end="01:33:02.620" style="s2">the whole modernist thing for a while</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.950" end="01:33:05.230" style="s2">and maybe they were successful early on</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.620" end="01:33:06.820" style="s2">and then they realized they were still</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.230" end="01:33:08.380" style="s2">miserable or they that made them</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.820" end="01:33:10.040" style="s2">miserable even and then they started</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.380" end="01:33:12.380" style="s2">meditating and taking</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.040" end="01:33:14.840" style="s2">psychedelics or web whatever or these</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.380" end="01:33:16.550" style="s2">things partly overlap a few years back</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.840" end="01:33:20.510" style="s2">and forth and some some major life</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.550" end="01:33:23.210" style="s2">crisis and then some therapy and usually</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.510" end="01:33:25.670" style="s2">they land in a position where they value</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.210" end="01:33:27.350" style="s2">spirituality and they want to use their</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.670" end="01:33:30.110" style="s2">life for doing something good or greater</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.350" end="01:33:32.450" style="s2">and they and they still have a strong</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.110" end="01:33:34.580" style="s2">financial capital and so on and and all</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.450" end="01:33:39.140" style="s2">of these all of this business know-how</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.580" end="01:33:42.380" style="s2">and this is a an important group in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.140" end="01:33:46.220" style="s2">core cities cities in Europe also and in</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.380" end="01:33:49.520" style="s2">London and in Berlin in Stockholm and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.220" end="01:33:51.080" style="s2">on and Copenhagen so it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.520" end="01:33:53.300" style="s2">understand the yoga Porsches it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.080" end="01:33:54.850" style="s2">the only part of the of the meta modern</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.300" end="01:33:56.660" style="s2">crowd here</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.850" end="01:33:59.660" style="s2">unfortunately the yoga Porsche I see</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.660" end="01:34:02.420" style="s2">generally is a bit too limited in its</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.660" end="01:34:05.710" style="s2">perspective and what I feel is lacking</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.420" end="01:34:09.350" style="s2">is a are two things really I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.710" end="01:34:11.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it says more revolutionary faith</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.350" end="01:34:13.340" style="s2">that would make them more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.780" end="01:34:17.390" style="s2">doing things like political meta</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.340" end="01:34:20.720" style="s2">modernism or or your game be and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.390" end="01:34:23.360" style="s2">other thing is actually the code the</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.720" end="01:34:26.300" style="s2">meta modern code meaning they need a</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.360" end="01:34:29.690" style="s2">more proper map what they&#39;re doing they</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.300" end="01:34:31.460" style="s2">just have an idea that hey if you reach</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.690" end="01:34:33.470" style="s2">it feels really cool to be in this high</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.460" end="01:34:36.890" style="s2">stage you can open your hard you can not</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.470" end="01:34:38.570" style="s2">be a dumb capitalist and you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.890" end="01:34:41.420" style="s2">transform business you can be a</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.570" end="01:34:43.990" style="s2">conscious capitalism well you can use</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.420" end="01:34:48.230" style="s2">your business for good that&#39;s alright</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.990" end="01:34:51.530" style="s2">but it won&#39;t take you to the next stage</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.230" end="01:34:53.750" style="s2">of society they don&#39;t have a real map to</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.530" end="01:34:56.330" style="s2">gather around and to be a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.750" end="01:34:58.940" style="s2">class to be a class that turns against</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.330" end="01:35:02.330" style="s2">modern society and organized us to</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.940" end="01:35:04.340" style="s2">consciously change its structures its</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.330" end="01:35:06.530" style="s2">informational architecture as we</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.340" end="01:35:08.990" style="s2">mentioned the structures of the internet</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.530" end="01:35:11.660" style="s2">its political structures and its culture</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.990" end="01:35:14.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s what needs to be done so I</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.660" end="01:35:16.190" style="s2">see within the yoga bourgeoisie that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.330" end="01:35:19.550" style="s2">mentioned that yes they have both of</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.190" end="01:35:22.880" style="s2">these elements but it&#39;s not successfully</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.550" end="01:35:23.630" style="s2">coordinated so rather you have people</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.880" end="01:35:26.090" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.630" end="01:35:28.550" style="s2">in one direction and then too far in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.090" end="01:35:30.530" style="s2">other or and not successfully</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.550" end="01:35:34.880" style="s2">coordinating that these things into</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.530" end="01:35:38.000" style="s2">shared life projects which take real</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.880" end="01:35:40.850" style="s2">risks and real Brunt&#39;s of the other</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.000" end="01:35:42.530" style="s2">problem and they end up always flying</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.850" end="01:35:44.450" style="s2">around the world and go to Thailand</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.530" end="01:35:47.900" style="s2">another time and going for another</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.450" end="01:35:49.520" style="s2">hundredth workshop and so on and then</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.900" end="01:35:51.460" style="s2">everybody wants a platform everybody</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.520" end="01:35:54.950" style="s2">else and they want to all want to create</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.460" end="01:35:57.380" style="s2">the next Facebook for all of these other</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.950" end="01:36:00.100" style="s2">people or and/or be the the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.380" end="01:36:03.560" style="s2">place for all of the others what I feel</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.100" end="01:36:06.710" style="s2">we need to do is to mobilize this class</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.560" end="01:36:09.470" style="s2">and to radicalize it within that class</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.710" end="01:36:11.870" style="s2">there is certainly a lot of know-how and</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.470" end="01:36:14.570" style="s2">capital and informational capital and</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.870" end="01:36:17.000" style="s2">and a financial capital and also I</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.570" end="01:36:18.410" style="s2">suppose emotional capital in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.000" end="01:36:20.570" style="s2">that there there&#39;s a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.410" end="01:36:22.430" style="s2">people are energized but there is not</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.570" end="01:36:24.680" style="s2">enough cultural capital they don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.430" end="01:36:27.560" style="s2">see the world and this is actually what</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.680" end="01:36:29.660" style="s2">they might lack them from the pomos from</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.560" end="01:36:33.440" style="s2">the post modernists a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.660" end="01:36:35.780" style="s2">critique a little bit more of seeing a</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.440" end="01:36:38.990" style="s2">society as society of seeing things</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.780" end="01:36:41.270" style="s2">sociological II might be exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.990" end="01:36:42.620" style="s2">this part of the world needs of its</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.270" end="01:36:44.090" style="s2">success that&#39;s part of it but you also</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.620" end="01:36:46.430" style="s2">hit on the other which is they need the</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.090" end="01:36:48.830" style="s2">right code and so far they don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.430" end="01:36:50.990" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting we could go on for</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.830" end="01:36:52.340" style="s2">two more hours and I&#39;m gonna ask you if</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.990" end="01:36:54.620" style="s2">we could schedule another session</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.340" end="01:36:56.690" style="s2">sometime in the future this has been I</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.620" end="01:36:59.060" style="s2">think the best single episode I have</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.690" end="01:37:00.890" style="s2">done yet but we are out we&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.060" end="01:37:02.660" style="s2">time and so I think we&#39;re gonna wrap it</p>
