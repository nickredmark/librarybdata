<p begin="00:00:13.425" end="00:00:14.775" style="s2"> Hello everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.650" end="00:00:18.650" style="s2"> Hope we can today</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.675" end="00:00:20.025" style="s2"> Finish the content of the first chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.075" end="00:00:21.450" style="s2"> That&#39;s probably what I planned</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.125" end="00:00:26.825" style="s2"> I finished my new book yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.450" end="00:00:38.525" style="s2"> It took me three years to finish this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.525" end="00:00:40.475" style="s2"> It’s a long time for writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.600" end="00:00:43.325" style="s2"> In short, it&#39;s finished</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:44.875" style="s2"> There is still the final finishing work</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.900" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2"> Some copy editing, etc. Hope it will go smoothly</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:48.850" style="s2"> I have done my best</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.900" end="00:00:50.025" style="s2"> I don’t know if it’s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.025" end="00:00:51.925" style="s2"> But I have tried my best anyway</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:53.700" style="s2"> Then next</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.200" end="00:00:58.950" style="s2"> Is the story i want to tell tonight</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.000" end="00:01:01.375" style="s2"> I keep thinking about this story just like last week</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.400" end="00:01:03.550" style="s2"> I&#39;ve been thinking about the question last week for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.550" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2"> But this week’s will be longer</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.125" end="00:01:09.825" style="s2"> There is one thing I can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.825" end="00:01:13.675" style="s2"> I can’t understand why in such a short story</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.850" end="00:01:16.625" style="s2"> Contains so much information</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.625" end="00:01:18.275" style="s2"> Especially the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.275" end="00:01:20.050" style="s2"> Whenever i read this story</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.075" end="00:01:23.150" style="s2"> I am always at a loss because</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.625" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2"> Because this story is only a short paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2"> Has no meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:33.925" style="s2"> I think about it repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.925" end="00:01:35.725" style="s2"> Whenever i think about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:40.075" style="s2"> I have a new understanding of this story</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.075" end="00:01:41.800" style="s2"> I can&#39;t understand why this happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:43.750" style="s2"> When I describe to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.775" end="00:01:47.125" style="s2"> The reasonable way is based on this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.875" end="00:01:51.525" style="s2"> That is, there is some wisdom in these stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.525" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2"> These wisdoms are generated from our interpersonal communication and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:01:55.725" style="s2"> Then show it on the image</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.725" end="00:01:57.875" style="s2"> They are in the long history</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.875" end="00:02:01.925" style="s2"> It is continuously condensed into clear text</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.925" end="00:02:04.175" style="s2"> And then for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.250" end="00:02:09.975" style="s2"> Repeated memory and transmission</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:11.325" style="s2"> Keep being refined</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.350" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2"> This is a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.725" end="00:02:14.825" style="s2"> I am happy to continue in this direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.825" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2"> But it keeps admiring me</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2"> There is so much information in such a short article</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.350" end="00:02:31.100" style="s2"> So we have to analyze it today</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.425" end="00:02:34.525" style="s2"> I think the story of Cain and Abel is especially true</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.525" end="00:02:37.850" style="s2"> Because it not only works at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.850" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2"> It has also been confirmed at the family and political levels</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:42.850" style="s2"> Even at war</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.850" end="00:02:44.775" style="s2"> And economically applicable</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.750" end="00:02:49.125" style="s2"> It covers too much for one essential story</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.525" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2"> You may have to refute but such a story</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:54.550" style="s2"> You never know what you are reading</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:02:56.025" style="s2"> Don&#39;t know what this story means</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.025" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2"> This is part of the so-called &quot;postmodern dilemma&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.700" end="00:03:00.175" style="s2"> This question is reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:04.425" style="s2"> This question really can&#39;t find an answer like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.425" end="00:03:06.625" style="s2"> State exactly how you understand the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.775" end="00:03:09.075" style="s2"> Not completely correct but it is enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.225" end="00:03:11.025" style="s2"> One answer says</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.075" end="00:03:13.775" style="s2"> &quot;Enough&quot; means it is executable</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.775" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2"> Nobody else strongly disagrees you won&#39;t die because of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:20.325" style="s2"> And nature will not limit you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.325" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2"> The limitations in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:26.525" style="s2"> You can be certain of your understanding to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.525" end="00:03:29.000" style="s2"> At least functionally feasible</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.000" end="00:03:31.375" style="s2"> This is very important</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:36.050" style="s2"> I guess you might want to explain these stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.075" end="00:03:38.200" style="s2"> Apply the same conditions</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:40.350" style="s2"> It may be good for now</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:42.775" style="s2"> But I hope you can be on multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.775" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2"> Find functionally important explanations</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.950" end="00:03:49.575" style="s2"> But I think it might be very small</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.625" end="00:03:53.150" style="s2"> It’s like finding one at multiple levels at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.175" end="00:03:55.725" style="s2"> Applicable story interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.750" end="00:03:58.575" style="s2"> Then apply one more level</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.600" end="00:04:00.975" style="s2"> You stumbled upon a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.975" end="00:04:03.525" style="s2"> The probability of accidental events will decrease, right?</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.525" end="00:04:06.125" style="s2"> There is a technical term in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.175" end="00:04:09.025" style="s2"> It seems to be called multiple traits and multiple methods</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:12.275" style="s2"> Is a way to define whether something is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:13.800" style="s2"> Its idea is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.600" end="00:04:18.075" style="s2"> The more methods you use to get the same result</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.425" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2"> The more you can be sure that you are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:24.500" style="s2"> Use your prior assumptions to deceive yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:26.875" style="s2"> But in fact it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.975" end="00:04:29.150" style="s2"> I guess this is another part of this method</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.450" end="00:04:32.700" style="s2"> This is also a method I used in my speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.700" end="00:04:34.675" style="s2"> I will not try to tell people any</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.675" end="00:04:36.600" style="s2"> Things that are not personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.625" end="00:04:40.200" style="s2"> Because you should know why you should teach you something</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.200" end="00:04:42.550" style="s2"> You should know what is good</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.550" end="00:04:45.350" style="s2"> It is personally good for you at least in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.400" end="00:04:46.725" style="s2"> And when you use it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.725" end="00:04:47.825" style="s2"> It should be good for your family</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.825" end="00:04:51.075" style="s2"> Maybe it should be important in a wider social group</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.175" end="00:04:53.025" style="s2"> I think this is the so-called &quot;meaning&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.025" end="00:04:55.950" style="s2"> I don’t think the fact that being taught lacks meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.975" end="00:04:58.700" style="s2"> is useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.700" end="00:05:00.875" style="s2"> Because the facts are infinite</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.875" end="00:05:03.325" style="s2"> And you can&#39;t remember them all</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.375" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2"> They must have substantial instrumental meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:09.050" style="s2"> Because we are creatures that use tools</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.500" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2"> These stories happen to have these aspects</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:14.225" style="s2"> as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.825" end="00:05:18.525" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:21.850" style="s2"> These are the stories in the second chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.050" end="00:05:24.175" style="s2"> These stories are very famous</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.175" end="00:05:27.875" style="s2"> In fact, everyone is immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.875" end="00:05:33.775" style="s2"> Generally speaking, people in Western culture should have heard these stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.875" end="00:05:36.025" style="s2"> This is also a very interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.025" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2"> That the story can be so based</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.525" end="00:05:38.500" style="s2"> So that everyone has heard</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.500" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2"> You can also say</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2"> So are many fairy tales</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:44.575" style="s2"> Or until now you can at least assume so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:48.525" style="s2"> But I think the foundation of the story</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.525" end="00:05:51.675" style="s2"> It also means that they must be given</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:55.875" style="s2"> Even if you don’t respect them, you will at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.900" end="00:05:58.950" style="s2"> Treat them as extraordinary curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.000" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2"> So why are these stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.250" end="00:06:02.275" style="s2"> Why are they passed down</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.275" end="00:06:03.950" style="s2"> Why everyone has heard</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.950" end="00:06:06.475" style="s2"> These questions cannot be answered with imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.500" end="00:06:10.225" style="s2"> You can try to use Freud&#39;s explanation</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.225" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2"> Freud believed that Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:16.525" style="s2"> Is based on the following viewpoints</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:19.700" style="s2"> The father in the family sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.750" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2"> Is extended to the dimension of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.675" style="s2"> And human beings have the same relationship with the Father of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.675" end="00:06:29.500" style="s2"> Just like the same baby or child</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.500" end="00:06:33.125" style="s2"> Relationship with father</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.250" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2"> I think this is a reasonable conclusion to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.175" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2"> But it does seem to Freud to be intentional</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.525" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2"> Does mean and not only</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:52.100" style="s2"> Belief that has at its apex</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.100" end="00:06:54.600" style="s2"> Anthropomorphic religious people</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.600" end="00:06:59.500" style="s2"> It&#39;s basically playing a role as a child under care</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.525" end="00:07:02.150" style="s2"> I have been thinking about this argument for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.150" end="00:07:03.800" style="s2"> Believe me this is a strong argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:05.325" style="s2"> In Ernest Becker’s &quot;Death Denial&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.325" end="00:07:07.725" style="s2"> This is one of the best books I have ever read</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.725" end="00:07:10.150" style="s2"> Just adopted the above argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.150" end="00:07:12.375" style="s2"> And like the others I’ve seen discussing this argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.450" end="00:07:16.025" style="s2"> The book has expanded</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:18.125" style="s2"> Becker tried to give Freud</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.125" end="00:07:20.950" style="s2"> Ending the psychoanalysis of religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.950" end="00:07:23.075" style="s2"> But he didn&#39;t do well</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.075" end="00:07:26.825" style="s2"> However, although I think this book is full of shortcomings and errors</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.825" end="00:07:28.475" style="s2"> But the flaws are not hiding</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.500" end="00:07:31.325" style="s2"> Some books are wrong but they are valuable</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.350" end="00:07:33.650" style="s2"> These books provide strong arguments</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.650" end="00:07:35.075" style="s2"> And take it to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.100" end="00:07:38.875" style="s2"> But I think Becker ignored Jung’s point of view</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.925" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if Freud also ignored</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.525" end="00:07:48.375" style="s2"> Becker who wrote this book from the perspective of religious psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.425" end="00:07:49.850" style="s2"> Never quote Jung’s views</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.875" end="00:07:52.750" style="s2"> Just mentioned in the introduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.750" end="00:07:54.325" style="s2"> I think this is the main mistake Becker made</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:57.675" style="s2"> But Becker adopted an argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.675" end="00:08:02.600" style="s2"> That is, the hypothesis about God is just a human attempt</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.675" end="00:08:07.450" style="s2"> Attempt to recreate an infant-like dependent state</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.475" end="00:08:10.625" style="s2"> To be able to rely on an omniscient priest</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.625" end="00:08:14.068" style="s2"> Maybe it’s to get back a comfortable feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.068" end="00:08:16.350" style="s2"> This feeling is what we experienced when we were young</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.350" end="00:08:19.300" style="s2"> There is a father who seems to us to know everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.300" end="00:08:21.150" style="s2"> Or lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.175" end="00:08:24.775" style="s2"> Have people who can bring similar feelings</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.775" end="00:08:28.975" style="s2"> The more I think about this, the more shocked I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.975" end="00:08:30.525" style="s2"> I always think it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.550" end="00:08:33.025" style="s2"> I remember Charles Taylor</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.025" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2"> I wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:38.150" style="s2"> I remember it was called &quot;The Urgency of the Modern Self&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.150" end="00:08:40.100" style="s2"> He is a philosopher of McGill school</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.100" end="00:08:43.450" style="s2"> I would not say that he is a fan of classic religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.475" end="00:08:44.625" style="s2"> But it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.625" end="00:08:47.550" style="s2"> Because he alone made a very interesting point about Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.175" style="s2"> He believes that if a religion is invented</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.175" end="00:08:53.625" style="s2"> It can only provide you with the comfort of infancy</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.700" end="00:08:56.750" style="s2"> Then why do you bother to imagine hell</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.025" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2"> This seems to be an unnecessary detail in the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:02.450" style="s2"> If religion is all about comfort</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.500" end="00:09:05.700" style="s2"> So why should people assume</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.750" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2"> The consequences of serious mistakes will be endless torture</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.275" end="00:09:12.275" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.150" end="00:09:17.575" style="s2"> Something that makes you feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.675" end="00:09:19.403" style="s2"> When James Joyce wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.425" end="00:09:21.775" style="s2"> Talking about his very bad nightmares when he was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:23.700" style="s2"> It comes from the preaching process of the Jesuit priest</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.750" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2"> The raging fire in the hell mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2"> He also wrote down what he remembered</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:32.125" style="s2"> The content is creepy</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.125" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2"> In James Joyce&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.100" end="00:09:36.175" style="s2"> I remember it was called &quot;A Portrait of a Young Artist&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.175" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2"> The book talks about the Jesuit priest telling him</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.125" end="00:09:43.625" style="s2"> Hell is like a prison wall seven miles deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.650" end="00:09:46.050" style="s2"> Dark and dark</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.050" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2"> People locked there</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.900" end="00:09:52.312" style="s2"> Will always be burned by the flames in the dark</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.325" end="00:09:56.550" style="s2"> Above the flames, their bodies are constantly growing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.600" end="00:09:58.450" style="s2"> Provide fuel for eternal hellfire</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.450" end="00:09:59.755" style="s2"> This is what everyone can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.755" end="00:10:01.375" style="s2"> The reason why the fire of purgatory can never burn</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.375" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2"> This is the obvious process</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.250" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2"> I don’t think this shows the satisfaction of my childhood wishes</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:10.150" style="s2"> You may doubt it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.200" end="00:10:13.775" style="s2"> Elaine Pagles who wrote a book about the devil</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.850" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2"> Is skeptical of this approach</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.625" end="00:10:18.325" style="s2"> She thinks it can be said to be a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.400" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2"> Invented hell as a place to place enemies</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:23.925" style="s2"> Ok this seems to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.925" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2"> But this is obviously inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.225" end="00:10:29.975" style="s2"> Although there is a convenient place to put your enemies</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.050" end="00:10:32.725" style="s2"> For example, Charles Taylor clearly pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:36.175" style="s2"> The modern fear of losing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.175" end="00:10:39.525" style="s2"> Or the loss of self-existence and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.525" end="00:10:43.875" style="s2"> May be roughly similar to the fear of hell in the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.875" end="00:10:46.125" style="s2"> In terms of existential strength</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.150" end="00:10:48.100" style="s2"> Hell is not only a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.100" end="00:10:50.475" style="s2"> Where the people you don&#39;t care about end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.475" end="00:10:52.225" style="s2"> it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.250" end="00:10:54.175" style="s2"> Where to go if you don&#39;t follow the rules</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.200" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2"> So I don’t think Freud’s view</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.750" end="00:11:00.300" style="s2"> Can stand up in the final analysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.350" end="00:11:04.475" style="s2"> Marx’s view is that religion is like the opium of the masses</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.525" end="00:11:07.250" style="s2"> He made a point similar to Freud</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:08.625" style="s2"> Just a little earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.650" end="00:11:12.475" style="s2"> His view is based on the following assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.525" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2"> That is, religious belief is just a story for the vulnerable group</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:18.575" style="s2"> The purpose is to appease them</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2"> Such malicious exploiters</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:29.625" style="s2"> Can continue to exploit and weaken their power</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:35.350" style="s2"> I think &quot;human institutions are</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:38.325" style="s2"> The view of &quot;fully driven by power&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.750" end="00:11:42.325" style="s2"> There is a problem to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.725" end="00:11:47.950" style="s2"> Of course every human organization will</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.975" end="00:11:50.100" style="s2"> Corrupt for various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.100" end="00:11:55.025" style="s2"> Also because it&#39;s especially like cheating</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.025" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2"> Corrupt by arrogantly coveting power</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:02.750" style="s2"> The religious system is not exempt</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.750" end="00:12:04.125" style="s2"> But this does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.125" end="00:12:05.875" style="s2"> They can be on these defects</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.950" end="00:12:08.025" style="s2"> Show some distinctive characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.100" end="00:12:09.525" style="s2"> Maybe you think they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.575" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2"> Maybe you can find a convincing reason for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:15.750" style="s2"> But you can’t say that this is generally obvious from preliminary proof</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.775" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2"> Treat it as a particularly useful criticism</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.950" end="00:12:23.191" style="s2"> I can&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.275" end="00:12:27.050" style="s2"> I think people who hold this view are too suspicious</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:29.925" style="s2"> I think for the people who write these stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:31.525" style="s2"> First of all, what do you plan to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.525" end="00:12:33.150" style="s2"> You guys want to successfully plan one</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:36.225" style="s2"> A stunning conspiracy that lasted 3000 years?</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.325" end="00:12:38.100" style="s2"> Good luck then</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.100" end="00:12:40.450" style="s2"> You can&#39;t even plan a plot that lasts a quarter of an hour</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.450" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2"> Without being cast aside by everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.875" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2"> This is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.025" end="00:12:47.975" style="s2"> No matter what the foundation of the architecture is</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.975" end="00:12:49.300" style="s2"> Not only the basis of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.300" end="00:12:51.950" style="s2"> And the dogmatic structure that emerged on this basis</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.950" end="00:12:53.950" style="s2"> I think only a single dimension of explanation is used to summarize them</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.950" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2"> Really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.350" end="00:12:57.800" style="s2"> In fact I always think</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.800" end="00:13:01.300" style="s2"> Any behavior that reduces complex human performance to a single dimension</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.300" end="00:13:04.500" style="s2"> Are only done by single-minded thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.500" end="00:13:06.200" style="s2"> I said this after careful consideration</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.200" end="00:13:08.375" style="s2"> Because Freud treated religion the same way</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.375" end="00:13:09.550" style="s2"> At least to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:11.225" style="s2"> Freud is a rigorous thinker</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.225" end="00:13:13.425" style="s2"> I think Marx is also a rigorous thinker</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.425" end="00:13:15.950" style="s2"> Even though he</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.550" end="00:13:18.950" style="s2"> Ok</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:23.950" style="s2"> He is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.950" end="00:13:24.900" style="s2"> As long as you have a sense of reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.900" end="00:13:28.400" style="s2"> You will be dumbfounded at Marx</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.075" end="00:13:32.025" style="s2"> Anyway what I want to say is I don’t think</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.050" end="00:13:33.425" style="s2"> Can any simple explanation</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.425" end="00:13:37.500" style="s2"> Can explain why these stories are so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.500" end="00:13:41.025" style="s2"> I don’t think you can reduce it to a political conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.025" end="00:13:41.800" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.875" end="00:13:45.150" style="s2"> I don’t think you can reduce it to mental naivety</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.425" end="00:13:48.250" style="s2"> I think you can think of them like me</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.275" end="00:13:52.975" style="s2"> A treasure trove of human collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.975" end="00:13:55.950" style="s2"> I received an interesting letter this week</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.950" end="00:13:57.225" style="s2"> I have many interesting letters</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.275" end="00:13:59.300" style="s2"> I think I can put them in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.325" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2"> And put it on the website some time</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:04.250" style="s2"> Of course you have to get their permission</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.870" end="00:14:07.975" style="s2"> The letter said he has been listening to my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.975" end="00:14:09.950" style="s2"> And noticed that I was looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.025" end="00:14:13.325" style="s2"> What can be called quasi-organism or evolutionary reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.375" end="00:14:18.490" style="s2"> Used to study the generation of information contained in the story</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.490" end="00:14:23.575" style="s2"> He also said, &quot;How do you know people of different religions</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.575" end="00:14:25.350" style="s2"> &quot;Or people with different religious traditions</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.375" end="00:14:27.150" style="s2"> &quot;Won&#39;t do exactly the same thing&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.200" end="00:14:30.642" style="s2"> I think first</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.642" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2"> It is possible to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:33.150" style="s2"> Because their religions overlap</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.200" end="00:14:35.925" style="s2"> For example, some things I talked about about Taoism</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.925" end="00:14:38.650" style="s2"> Taoism treats being as</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.700" end="00:14:42.475" style="s2"> Balance between eternal chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.500" end="00:14:43.925" style="s2"> One thing I didn’t mention I didn’t think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.925" end="00:14:45.425" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.475" end="00:14:48.525" style="s2"> There is a neuropsychologist named Eknane Goldberg</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:14:50.675" style="s2"> He is a student of Alexander Lulia</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:51.799" style="s2"> I think Lulia</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.799" end="00:14:53.750" style="s2"> Is the greatest neuropsychologist of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.750" end="00:14:54.625" style="s2"> He is russian</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.175" style="s2"> He was the first group to be truly sure in general</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.225" end="00:15:01.900" style="s2"> One of the functional people of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.900" end="00:15:04.525" style="s2"> Its function has been a mystery for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.550" end="00:15:07.425" style="s2"> Speaking of Goldberg, everyone knows that the human brain has two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.475" end="00:15:09.450" style="s2"> Left brain and right brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.450" end="00:15:12.250" style="s2"> People usually think that the left brain is for right-handed people</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.425" end="00:15:14.275" style="s2"> Especially right-handed men</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.300" end="00:15:17.125" style="s2"> Because women&#39;s neurological functions are more scattered</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.125" end="00:15:21.700" style="s2"> This makes women more able to withstand brain damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.625" end="00:15:26.175" style="s2"> Maybe the male brain function is more concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.175" end="00:15:27.675" style="s2"> This makes the male brain function more specialized</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.700" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2"> But more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.625" end="00:15:32.525" style="s2"> Closer to home, the human brain has two hemispheres left and right</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.575" end="00:15:34.225" style="s2"> But no one knows why</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.225" end="00:15:37.000" style="s2"> We know that the left and right brains each have a similar consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.050" end="00:15:41.400" style="s2"> If you separate the corpus callosum connecting the left and right brains</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.425" end="00:15:46.050" style="s2"> For example, to treat certain cases of intractable epilepsy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.050" end="00:15:48.175" style="s2"> Every hemisphere can to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.175" end="00:15:50.725" style="s2"> Develop their own consciousness independently</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.750" end="00:15:53.450" style="s2"> The right brain is usually nonverbal while the left brain is verbal</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.500" end="00:15:56.375" style="s2"> So there is a view that the left brain is a language hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.375" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2"> The right brain is a nonverbal hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:01.725" style="s2"> But this is not right because obviously animals can’t speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.725" end="00:16:03.075" style="s2"> But animals also have separate brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.200" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2"> So even if it is true</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:07.100" style="s2"> Causally has nothing to do with language</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.675" end="00:16:09.825" style="s2"> Goldberg proposed another hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.825" end="00:16:14.450" style="s2"> That is, the left and right brains are respectively specialized in routine and unconventional activities</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.450" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2"> Or rather novel and familiar with chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:21.200" style="s2"> This is really a bold idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.200" end="00:16:22.525" style="s2"> When i first heard this</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.600" end="00:16:25.825" style="s2"> I also treat it as a signal</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.925" end="00:16:27.150" style="s2"> A so-called</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.400" end="00:16:32.550" style="s2"> The verification signal of the structure of the multiple characteristics and multiple methods</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.650" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2"> Because i never thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:35.450" style="s2"> The brain hemisphere will behave in this way</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.450" end="00:16:39.575" style="s2"> And Goldberg put forward this point in the course of history</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:41.275" style="s2"> This view and any thinking inspired by myth</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:42.725" style="s2"> All completely different</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.750" end="00:16:44.625" style="s2"> Lack of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.625" end="00:16:48.175" style="s2"> In fact it is more subject to materialism</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.175" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2"> The advancement of Russian neuropsychology</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:52.725" style="s2"> The subject is classified as materialism for political reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.725" end="00:16:54.575" style="s2"> There are also scientific reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.750" end="00:16:56.650" style="s2"> But the core point is that one hemisphere of the human brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.725" end="00:16:59.350" style="s2"> Can react quickly to things we are not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.400" end="00:17:01.225" style="s2"> This hemisphere is more imaginative and more distributed</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.225" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2"> And it’s more related to negative emotions</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:06.525" style="s2"> Because negative emotions can be perceived immediately</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.525" end="00:17:08.575" style="s2"> When you encounter something you don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.700" end="00:17:11.750" style="s2"> Negative emotions are actually a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.850" end="00:17:14.900" style="s2"> I&#39;m in a state of not knowing how things are going</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.900" end="00:17:16.250" style="s2"> The right brain will remind you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.275" end="00:17:17.900" style="s2"> Then the right brain will quickly generate video</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.900" end="00:17:19.800" style="s2"> To help you figure out what&#39;s in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.800" end="00:17:22.800" style="s2"> Then the left brain takes over</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.800" end="00:17:25.175" style="s2"> Use this thing more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.175" end="00:17:28.250" style="s2"> The rigorous explanation allows you to fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.250" end="00:17:31.425" style="s2"> So there is a dynamic balance between the left and right hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.425" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2"> The left brain tries to establish the order of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:35.850" style="s2"> Ramachandran</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.900" end="00:17:42.025" style="s2"> A very famous neuroscientist in California</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.025" end="00:17:44.275" style="s2"> Also developed a theory similar to Goldberg</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.300" end="00:17:47.950" style="s2"> He believes that the left brain has established a regular order of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.950" end="00:17:51.725" style="s2"> The right brain is responsible for creating novelty</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:56.275" style="s2"> React to new things and generate novel hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.275" end="00:17:58.325" style="s2"> He believes that with the support of existing good evidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.375" end="00:18:01.050" style="s2"> What happens in my sleep is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.100" end="00:18:04.300" style="s2"> Right brain to left brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.300" end="00:18:07.125" style="s2"> Little by little transmission of information</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.125" end="00:18:11.250" style="s2"> Such a novel revelation for the right brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.300" end="00:18:15.925" style="s2"> So as not to damage the left brain carefully built</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.925" end="00:18:17.300" style="s2"> Rigorous structural order</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.300" end="00:18:24.725" style="s2"> I also like this theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.825" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2"> Because it also helps to prove</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:30.999" style="s2"> The hypothesis I have been expounding for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.050" end="00:18:35.400" style="s2"> That is, a part of our individual extends self to the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.400" end="00:18:37.150" style="s2"> And trying to understand things we don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.150" end="00:18:39.900" style="s2"> That part extends itself to behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.900" end="00:18:42.350" style="s2"> Emotions and video</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:45.675" style="s2"> Possibly also poetry and narrative</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.725" end="00:18:47.000" style="s2"> With the development process</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.075" end="00:18:48.300" style="s2"> We have developed more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.325" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2"> Clear expression of emerging knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.750" end="00:18:55.375" style="s2"> So you can map it to neurologists in a good place</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.375" end="00:18:58.975" style="s2"> About the neuropsychologist</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.100" end="00:19:01.650" style="s2"> What constitutes the presumption of brain hemisphere differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.700" end="00:19:02.950" style="s2"> One more cool thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.975" end="00:19:04.625" style="s2"> Demonstration about the differentiation of brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.675" end="00:19:07.900" style="s2"> As far as I know, it’s worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.900" end="00:19:09.250" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:15.825" style="s2"> Ned Flanders used one word to describe</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.825" end="00:19:16.950" style="s2"> &quot;Staggering&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.050" end="00:19:19.050" style="s2"> I think it probably means this haha</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.050" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2"> Anyway we do assume</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:25.725" style="s2"> We are biologically adapted to reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.725" end="00:19:28.375" style="s2"> If you are a darwinist</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.475" end="00:19:29.675" style="s2"> This is actually an axiomatic definition</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.875" end="00:19:32.875" style="s2"> Because by definition natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.875" end="00:19:35.375" style="s2"> This is the natural survival of the fittest</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.500" end="00:19:39.900" style="s2"> If natural selection of species with separate brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.900" end="00:19:42.300" style="s2"> Because half of you need to deal with chaos</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.300" end="00:19:44.725" style="s2"> The other half of you need to maintain order</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.725" end="00:19:47.425" style="s2"> So you can draw conclusions that can stand scrutiny</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.425" end="00:19:49.675" style="s2"> The world is born out of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.675" end="00:19:53.575" style="s2"> This is something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.725" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2"> if you are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2"> You can take some time to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.950" end="00:19:59.375" style="s2"> To blame for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.375" end="00:20:01.175" style="s2"> These stories cover a lot of content</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.625" end="00:20:04.275" style="s2"> We continue to study some</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.350" end="00:20:06.750" style="s2"> Let’s start with the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:12.700" style="s2"> You may remember that the Bible is a series of books</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.150" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2"> The Bible is actually like a library</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2"> These books are written by different people</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.425" end="00:20:21.925" style="s2"> Edited by different people</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.925" end="00:20:26.200" style="s2"> Edited countless times in the long river of history</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.650" end="00:20:29.575" style="s2"> Not by someone alone, but by a hundred schools of thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.575" end="00:20:33.075" style="s2"> For a long time there was a default tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.075" end="00:20:34.975" style="s2"> The first book that appeared was written by Moses</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.025" end="00:20:39.900" style="s2"> To be honest, this may be incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.900" end="00:20:42.275" style="s2"> Although it may be correct from a dramatic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.375" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2"> Or it is &quot;fairy-tale correctness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.500" end="00:20:50.300" style="s2"> I don&#39;t mean to belittle fairy tales</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.675" end="00:20:51.925" style="s2"> These authors</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.950" end="00:20:54.600" style="s2"> For now, the way to identify these authors is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.950" end="00:20:59.000" style="s2"> Identify certain stylistic characteristics in different stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.025" end="00:21:00.075" style="s2"> Use of words</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.075" end="00:21:01.125" style="s2"> Such as the term &quot;God&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.125" end="00:21:04.325" style="s2"> Different poetry styles, different themes, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.625" end="00:21:08.075" style="s2"> People spent almost 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.925" end="00:21:11.050" style="s2"> Trying to figure out who wrote which article</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.225" end="00:21:13.000" style="s2"> How did these stories piece together</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.400" end="00:21:15.325" style="s2"> This is not important for our purposes</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.325" end="00:21:22.350" style="s2"> The important thing is that it is a collection of collective narrative traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.350" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2"> Or a collection of collective narrative wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.275" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2"> We can not discuss it so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:28.825" style="s2"> But at least we can say that it is a collection of narrative traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.500" end="00:21:31.375" style="s2"> These traditions are kept and others are abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.375" end="00:21:32.425" style="s2"> There is a reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.425" end="00:21:34.175" style="s2"> The stories are arranged in a specific order</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.325" end="00:21:37.975" style="s2"> There are also complicated reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.975" end="00:21:40.375" style="s2"> The Bible as literature</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.375" end="00:21:42.350" style="s2"> The very good point is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.350" end="00:21:45.325" style="s2"> It’s really plot-like.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.450" end="00:21:49.000" style="s2"> It involves many levels</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.425" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2"> But it has been in thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:52.750" style="s2"> Pieced together by people</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.750" end="00:21:54.875" style="s2"> Maybe 4000 years maybe longer</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.875" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2"> If you count the previous oral tradition period</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:21:59.300" style="s2"> God knows how long</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.975" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2"> Part of human collective imagination</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:07.025" style="s2"> Put together a library with a storyline</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.850" end="00:22:11.575" style="s2"> I see the Bible as</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.700" end="00:22:13.925" style="s2"> A collective attempt by mankind to solve the most profound problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.275" end="00:22:19.525" style="s2"> I think these are questions about self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.425" end="00:22:22.275" style="s2"> About us are not immortal</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.275" end="00:22:24.225" style="s2"> The fact that we are going to die and know it well</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.300" end="00:22:30.425" style="s2"> This is a unique dilemma for mankind</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.425" end="00:22:31.850" style="s2"> Distinguish us from everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:34.300" style="s2"> This is shown in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.225" end="00:22:37.550" style="s2"> I think what makes us so unique</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.350" end="00:22:39.625" style="s2"> Shown in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.750" end="00:22:41.725" style="s2"> Interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.725" end="00:22:44.275" style="s2"> I realize this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.275" end="00:22:45.750" style="s2"> After finishing the previous three lectures</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:53.700" style="s2"> The Bible describes the great changes at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.700" end="00:22:56.075" style="s2"> This great change has given mankind a sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.075" end="00:22:58.550" style="s2"> Cracks in the structure of existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.850" end="00:23:00.075" style="s2"> This is the correct way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.300" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2"> This has cosmic significance</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.675" end="00:23:04.675" style="s2"> You can refute</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.675" end="00:23:06.475" style="s2"> Events that happen to humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.475" end="00:23:07.650" style="s2"> Won&#39;t have cosmic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.650" end="00:23:12.100" style="s2"> We are just a fleeting dog-like entity</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:14.525" style="s2"> Living here like a cancer</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.775" end="00:23:16.725" style="s2"> Sojourn in the vast sky</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.725" end="00:23:19.225" style="s2"> In the corner of an unknown galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.225" end="00:23:20.600" style="s2"> Rotating on a little planet</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.850" end="00:23:22.325" style="s2"> Everything that happens to us is meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.725" end="00:23:24.900" style="s2"> You can stick to this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.900" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2"> I would not recommend you to do this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.575" end="00:23:29.375" style="s2"> Part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:31.850" style="s2"> This is untrue for whatever purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.025" end="00:23:36.350" style="s2"> You can&#39;t live well with such thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.950" end="00:23:39.175" style="s2"> In fact, if you really insist on this idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.175" end="00:23:40.250" style="s2"> If you really think so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.250" end="00:23:41.375" style="s2"> You may lose your life in the end</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.500" end="00:23:43.950" style="s2"> This really reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.950" end="00:23:47.650" style="s2"> I have talked to many people with serious suicidal tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.650" end="00:23:51.275" style="s2"> Before they give birth to the idea of ​​ending their lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:53.375" style="s2"> Their conclusions about the utility of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.375" end="00:23:56.825" style="s2"> And you stick to the conclusion of that idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.825" end="00:23:59.150" style="s2"> Are highly similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.550" end="00:24:00.625" style="s2"> If you are interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.625" end="00:24:03.800" style="s2"> You can read Leo Tolstoy&#39;s &quot;Confessions&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.350" end="00:24:08.700" style="s2"> This is a short and powerful book</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.025" end="00:24:13.275" style="s2"> Tolstoy described his time in the heyday of fame</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.275" end="00:24:14.675" style="s2"> Desire for suicide</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.375" end="00:24:16.950" style="s2"> The most famous author in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.150" end="00:24:20.450" style="s2"> High-ranking households are world-renowned</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.650" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2"> We are admired by thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:28.275" style="s2"> He has everything you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.275" end="00:24:32.725" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t dare to walk into the barn with a rope or gun</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.725" end="00:24:34.925" style="s2"> He was afraid he would hang himself or shoot himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:36.525" style="s2"> He finally came out of the shadows</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.525" end="00:24:40.900" style="s2"> And what he experienced</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:44.375" style="s2"> This is a very good book</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.500" end="00:24:51.150" style="s2"> The &quot;Bible&quot; story beginning with Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.150" end="00:24:52.625" style="s2"> Tells a different story</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.475" end="00:24:57.475" style="s2"> They bring the emergence of human self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:24:59.800" style="s2"> Considered as a cosmic change event</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.500" end="00:25:01.400" style="s2"> You might ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.400" end="00:25:02.825" style="s2"> What do we have to do with the universe</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.875" end="00:25:03.900" style="s2"> the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.900" end="00:25:06.525" style="s2"> Depends on what you think is the relationship between consciousness and the universe</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.875" end="00:25:09.125" style="s2"> Maybe it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.925" end="00:25:11.250" style="s2"> I will choose closely related</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.250" end="00:25:12.475" style="s2"> Because in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.650" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2"> Of course you can disagree</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:17.775" style="s2"> But if you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.775" end="00:25:20.300" style="s2"> Consciousness is a force with universal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.050" end="00:25:25.075" style="s2"> Being itself depends on any real meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.075" end="00:25:26.800" style="s2"> At least on any empirical meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.800" end="00:25:29.425" style="s2"> Then the following assumptions are reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.950" end="00:25:35.150" style="s2"> That is, the complete reconstruction of consciousness can be given</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.150" end="00:25:37.875" style="s2"> Some kind of cosmic or metaphysical meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.646" end="00:25:39.771" style="s2"> Even from a perspective other than human</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.916" end="00:25:42.449" style="s2"> It is still incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.449" end="00:25:43.750" style="s2"> Whatever it means</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.750" end="00:25:45.950" style="s2"> It is real from a human perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.950" end="00:25:46.900" style="s2"> It&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:51.550" style="s2"> In a sense this is the first event since the creation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.550" end="00:25:52.600" style="s2"> Catastrophic fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.600" end="00:25:54.300" style="s2"> The rest of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.300" end="00:25:56.075" style="s2"> Are trying to figure out how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.850" end="00:26:03.075" style="s2"> For example, in the Old Testament story</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.125" end="00:26:06.700" style="s2"> What happened next was the establishment of the State of Israel</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.025" end="00:26:10.150" style="s2"> Then rise and fall</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.325" end="00:26:11.950" style="s2"> Then people started</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.875" end="00:26:14.900" style="s2"> Hundreds or even thousands of years of exploration</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:16.675" style="s2"> Follow this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.675" end="00:26:17.875" style="s2"> In the tragic result of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.900" end="00:26:20.325" style="s2"> Ways to protect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.325" end="00:26:22.125" style="s2"> Is dedicated to the country</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.925" end="00:26:26.850" style="s2"> But it turned out that the country itself began to show morbidity</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.250" end="00:26:28.825" style="s2"> When these illnesses start to accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.825" end="00:26:31.675" style="s2"> The country began to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.500" end="00:26:34.625" style="s2"> Then rise again and rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.625" end="00:26:37.300" style="s2"> It collapses and rebirth repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.675" end="00:26:39.375" style="s2"> So many cycles</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.375" end="00:26:39.400" style="s2"> This mainly comes from the explanation of Northrop Frye</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:41.775" style="s2"> This mainly comes from the explanation of Northrop Frye</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.525" end="00:26:44.575" style="s2"> People began to think &quot;the country is the place of salvation&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.575" end="00:26:50.675" style="s2"> Is this idea wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.050" end="00:26:52.800" style="s2"> Is this idea flawed?</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.075" style="s2"> On this basis</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.850" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2"> There was a Christian revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2"> And such a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.575" end="00:27:04.500" style="s2"> &quot;The country is not a place of salvation&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.575" end="00:27:05.775" style="s2"> The individual&#39;s mind is</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.825" end="00:27:12.175" style="s2"> And correspondingly appeared the ethical system</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.175" end="00:27:13.450" style="s2"> It&#39;s also very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.775" end="00:27:20.950" style="s2"> The ethics of salvation after the failure of the “state experiment” is</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.350" end="00:27:27.575" style="s2"> &quot;Salvation is presented in the mind of the individual&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.475" end="00:27:30.525" style="s2"> Even in terms of country</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.525" end="00:27:32.950" style="s2"> Because of the normal operation of the country</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.175" end="00:27:34.900" style="s2"> Depends on the normal operation of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.225" end="00:27:37.275" style="s2"> Fundamentally and not the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.875" end="00:27:41.300" style="s2"> The correct way to redeem individuals is truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.200" end="00:27:46.350" style="s2"> The truth is in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.975" end="00:27:49.850" style="s2"> The antidote to the suffering caused by the fall of man</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.300" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2"> This echoes the chapter we discussed earlier</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.350" style="s2"> There is a claim in the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.600" end="00:28:03.300" style="s2"> Is the way of truth to create order in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.300" end="00:28:04.450" style="s2"> But more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.450" end="00:28:06.500" style="s2"> This is also when I gave the lecture three weeks before</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.500" end="00:28:08.200" style="s2"> Just realized</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.250" end="00:28:10.350" style="s2"> When God uses truth to introduce order into existence</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:13.400" style="s2"> He kept saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.725" end="00:28:16.400" style="s2"> The being that he introduced into being is good</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.050" end="00:28:18.675" style="s2"> Have such a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.450" end="00:28:22.250" style="s2"> Beings that introduce beings through truth are good</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.875" end="00:28:25.525" style="s2"> The interesting thing is at the beginning of the story</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.900" end="00:28:28.025" style="s2"> Have such a hint</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.500" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2"> It’s about the state of being enshrined in Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.150" end="00:28:37.825" style="s2"> Before they fell and gained self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.050" end="00:28:40.850" style="s2"> They were created in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.875" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2"> And revealed the following truths</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2"> That is, &quot;the existence itself is reasonably balanced&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.100" end="00:28:48.675" style="s2"> The entire Bible is a re-exploration of this view</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.700" end="00:28:50.975" style="s2"> This is a trace to the origin</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.675" end="00:28:55.025" style="s2"> This is a classic mythological theme</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.875" end="00:28:56.825" style="s2"> Wise people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.825" end="00:29:00.025" style="s2"> The person who regained what was lost in childhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:04.350" style="s2"> I think this is a Jewish concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.350" end="00:29:06.225" style="s2"> If I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.225" end="00:29:07.525" style="s2"> Is a messianic character</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.675" end="00:29:11.425" style="s2"> Is the one who regained what was lost in childhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.425" end="00:29:13.300" style="s2"> There is back to the original concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.300" end="00:29:18.625" style="s2"> But you are not falling back to childhood and unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.875" end="00:29:23.725" style="s2"> But you return to your childhood fully awake and spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.275" end="00:29:26.650" style="s2"> Then decided to pass the truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.650" end="00:29:29.425" style="s2"> To participate in the presentation of reasonable beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.675" end="00:29:31.800" style="s2"> I study psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.800" end="00:29:34.575" style="s2"> I have been teaching personality theory for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.325" end="00:29:38.625" style="s2"> I have a deep understanding of personality theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.900" end="00:29:40.625" style="s2"> I also know something about philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.625" end="00:29:42.725" style="s2"> Although I don’t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.725" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2"> But what i can tell you is</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.775" end="00:29:47.000" style="s2"> In all the theories that I have read and encountered</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.000" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2"> I have never seen any theory so profound</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.275" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2"> Not only profound but also credible</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.325" end="00:29:55.925" style="s2"> As a clinician, I also observed</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.925" end="00:29:59.475" style="s2"> I think this is unique to clinical experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.475" end="00:30:04.275" style="s2"> And was accurately described by outstanding clinicians</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.275" end="00:30:07.150" style="s2"> &quot;It is the truth that can heal the pain in treatment.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.250" end="00:30:09.575" style="s2"> The truth is the cure</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.575" end="00:30:11.775" style="s2"> There are clinical exposure treatments for what you fear</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.775" end="00:30:12.725" style="s2"> There are also escape treatments</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.925" end="00:30:14.900" style="s2"> But I think this is a form of practicing the truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.900" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2"> If you know what you need to do according to your own standards</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.000" end="00:30:19.925" style="s2"> But avoid doing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.925" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2"> Then you are practicing lies</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.575" end="00:30:22.625" style="s2"> You did not verbally lie</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.625" end="00:30:23.500" style="s2"> You are practicing lies with actions</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.500" end="00:30:24.650" style="s2"> No different at all</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:28.975" style="s2"> So if I can let you face</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.975" end="00:30:30.575" style="s2"> Things you know you shouldn&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.575" end="00:30:33.300" style="s2"> We are all involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.975" end="00:30:36.825" style="s2"> The process of trying to make you show the deepest truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.325" end="00:30:39.325" style="s2"> This can improve people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.750" end="00:30:41.025" style="s2"> Can completely improve their lives</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.300" end="00:30:43.650" style="s2"> Numerous clinical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.075" end="00:30:45.800" style="s2"> We know if you expose people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.800" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2"> They are afraid and in front of things they avoid</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.150" end="00:30:48.850" style="s2"> They can overcome it slowly</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.275" end="00:30:50.975" style="s2"> You have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.975" end="00:30:53.500" style="s2"> Involve them in the process</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.450" end="00:30:56.925" style="s2"> But there is one point in all the theories established by clinicians</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.925" end="00:30:58.700" style="s2"> This is first of all credible</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.700" end="00:31:01.575" style="s2"> Based on deeper consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.900" end="00:31:04.525" style="s2"> That is, clinical experience is redeemable</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.050" end="00:31:07.275" style="s2"> It aims to solve the pain</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.575" end="00:31:10.025" style="s2"> Because the people involved in this process</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.275" end="00:31:11.525" style="s2"> Are telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.925" end="00:31:13.475" style="s2"> You will think this is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.675" end="00:31:17.425" style="s2"> Because when you have a problem and come to talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.875" end="00:31:19.825" style="s2"> First when you come to talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.825" end="00:31:21.525" style="s2"> You acknowledged the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.525" end="00:31:22.775" style="s2"> This is a good start</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.125" end="00:31:25.375" style="s2"> Second, if you talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.375" end="00:31:26.625" style="s2"> We know the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.850" end="00:31:28.425" style="s2"> If we know the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.425" end="00:31:31.075" style="s2"> We can start to list some solutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.075" end="00:31:33.425" style="s2"> Then you can put it into practice to see if these methods are effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.750" end="00:31:35.550" style="s2"> But if you don’t admit the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.550" end="00:31:36.775" style="s2"> Refused to tell me what the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.050" end="00:31:41.325" style="s2"> And I&#39;m pretending to be mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.325" end="00:31:43.875" style="s2"> Always dominate the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.050" end="00:31:45.450" style="s2"> What&#39;s the use</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.300" end="00:31:48.325" style="s2"> We are immersed in delusion</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.325" end="00:31:50.500" style="s2"> Maybe this will bring short-term comfort</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.500" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2"> But it is useless</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.800" end="00:31:55.950" style="s2"> If you think about it, it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.300" end="00:32:01.625" style="s2"> Freud believed that depression is the core of mental pain</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.975" end="00:32:06.525" style="s2"> Repression and deception are only the difference in degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.525" end="00:32:07.225" style="s2"> Nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.450" end="00:32:09.475" style="s2"> Is the difference in degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.075" end="00:32:11.225" style="s2"> Alfred Adler</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.225" end="00:32:14.400" style="s2"> Is one of Freud’s best colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.475" end="00:32:16.125" style="s2"> I think he is underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:18.075" style="s2"> He thinks people are in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.075" end="00:32:20.700" style="s2"> Because of practicing the &quot;life lie&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.725" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2"> He put forward the &quot;life lie&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.100" end="00:32:22.925" style="s2"> This is worth studying</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.925" end="00:32:25.500" style="s2"> Because Adler is not as attractive as Freud</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.800" end="00:32:26.825" style="s2"> But he is very practical</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.825" end="00:32:31.650" style="s2"> He did foresee the development of cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.750" end="00:32:34.025" style="s2"> Jung thinks you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.300" end="00:32:36.575" style="s2"> Only by making appropriate moral efforts in life</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.575" end="00:32:39.825" style="s2"> You can ignore psychotherapy completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.250" end="00:32:41.550" style="s2"> Carl Rogers thinks</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.550" end="00:32:45.175" style="s2"> Candid communication through dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.175" end="00:32:47.275" style="s2"> Can produce salvation results</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.275" end="00:32:51.475" style="s2"> Behaviouralists believe that micro-analysis of the problems before them</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.475" end="00:32:54.925" style="s2"> And then lead people to face the things they avoid</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.825" end="00:32:59.425" style="s2"> All of this seems to me just</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.825" end="00:33:01.975" style="s2"> The secular variant of &quot;the truth will set you free&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.675" end="00:33:06.425" style="s2"> This is a very powerful story</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.900" end="00:33:11.975" style="s2"> First of all, this story is not easy to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.975" end="00:33:15.075" style="s2"> Secondly, if you ignore it, you are actually taking a risk</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.075" end="00:33:20.075" style="s2"> I have seen people who have been deeply hurt</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.450" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2"> Mostly hurt by deception</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.925" end="00:33:24.500" style="s2"> This is worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.475" end="00:33:26.750" style="s2"> Life will hit you head on</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.800" end="00:33:29.375" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.050" end="00:33:33.325" style="s2"> But I thought for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.325" end="00:33:38.750" style="s2"> People can withstand earthquakes, cancer and even death</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.675" end="00:33:42.850" style="s2"> But they can&#39;t bear betrayal and can&#39;t bear cheating</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.375" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2"> They can&#39;t bear someone trusted by the one they love</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:47.450" style="s2"> Deception and betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.925" end="00:33:49.225" style="s2"> This will destroy them</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.200" end="00:33:54.075" style="s2"> It makes them sick and painful</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.825" end="00:33:56.775" style="s2"> Cause psychological and physical trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.775" end="00:33:57.450" style="s2"> Not only that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.450" end="00:33:58.175" style="s2"> Betrayal will make them</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.175" end="00:34:00.500" style="s2"> Cynical, bitter, vicious and resentful</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.875" end="00:34:04.475" style="s2"> They also started to do evil to the world, forming a vicious circle</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.700" end="00:34:08.875" style="s2"> At the beginning of the story</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.925" style="s2"> God uses truth to create good beings</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.000" end="00:34:16.900" style="s2"> Then the disaster happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.575" end="00:34:21.025" style="s2"> Mankind spent thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.025" end="00:34:23.925" style="s2"> Trying to figure out how to deal with this catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.925" end="00:34:25.400" style="s2"> The fact that they have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.675" end="00:34:30.050" style="s2"> We are indeed self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.275" end="00:34:32.200" style="s2"> Other animals have no such consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.475" end="00:34:35.525" style="s2"> You will read about chimpanzees as an example</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.100" end="00:34:38.075" style="s2"> If you put lipstick on chimps</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.525" end="00:34:40.900" style="s2"> This is a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.325" end="00:34:47.150" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.700" end="00:34:51.575" style="s2"> If you show chimps in the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.575" end="00:34:52.675" style="s2"> It will wipe off the lipstick</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.675" end="00:34:57.275" style="s2"> Dolphins seem to be able to distinguish themselves in the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.275" end="00:35:02.175" style="s2"> There is a budding of self-consciousness in other animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.600" end="00:35:07.075" style="s2"> But put it in the concept of human self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.100" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2"> I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.725" end="00:35:15.275" style="s2"> At least it is not yet formed</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.275" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2"> But I also think it is caused by</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:22.650" style="s2"> Driven by a potential anti-humanist drive</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.600" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2"> Human self-awareness has developed very well</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:29.375" style="s2"> The self-awareness of animals is totally different</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.650" end="00:35:34.425" style="s2"> It’s like when the vervet monkey spotted the predator</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.425" end="00:35:35.625" style="s2"> Warning call</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.625" end="00:35:37.250" style="s2"> Compared with human language</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.425" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2"> There are indeed similarities between the two</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:42.925" style="s2"> Animal calls are also meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.925" end="00:35:43.775" style="s2"> But the call is not language</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.775" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2"> The self-consciousness of animals is the original self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:49.550" style="s2"> There are few self-aware animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.900" end="00:35:51.150" style="s2"> Incomparable with humans</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.450" end="00:35:53.400" style="s2"> They have no idea of ​​the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.400" end="00:35:56.375" style="s2"> They don’t know their limitations in time and space</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.725" end="00:35:57.800" style="s2"> this is very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.800" end="00:35:59.775" style="s2"> Especially time</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.025" end="00:36:02.625" style="s2"> Humans &quot;discovered&quot; time</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:04.025" style="s2"> When we &quot;discovered&quot; time</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.025" end="00:36:06.950" style="s2"> We have discovered the end of each of our beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.550" end="00:36:08.975" style="s2"> This distinguishes us from animals</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.300" end="00:36:11.050" style="s2"> This is the connotation of the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.500" end="00:36:16.950" style="s2"> The first chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot; is from the priest&#39;s literature</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.975" end="00:36:18.500" style="s2"> God is called in priest literature</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.500" end="00:36:20.075" style="s2"> &quot;Ilohim&quot; or &quot;Ilshade&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.075" end="00:36:25.225" style="s2"> There are singular gods and plural gods</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.225" end="00:36:27.500" style="s2"> I think the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.500" end="00:36:31.725" style="s2"> If you analyze the history of monotheism</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.125" end="00:36:35.225" style="s2"> Monotheism actually developed from polytheism</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.725" end="00:36:36.725" style="s2"> As i said before</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.725" end="00:36:40.950" style="s2"> I think the gods represent the fundamental power</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.950" end="00:36:43.825" style="s2"> These fundamental forces must be organized in hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:48.175" style="s2"> Must have authority</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.175" end="00:36:50.075" style="s2"> Otherwise they can only conflict with each other and achieve nothing</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.750" end="00:36:52.925" style="s2"> Value must be organized in levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.925" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2"> Or just one</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:55.825" style="s2"> Whether it&#39;s for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.825" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2"> Still for the country</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.875" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2"> If you don’t know what to do next</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.150" end="00:37:02.600" style="s2"> You do it all blindly</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.925" end="00:37:04.875" style="s2"> This is doomed to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.875" end="00:37:05.775" style="s2"> You have to sort out the priority</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.100" end="00:37:07.925" style="s2"> One thing always takes precedence over others</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.325" end="00:37:10.900" style="s2"> Arrange according to the hierarchy to avoid chaos</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.250" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2"> So the rules of hierarchy appeared in the gods</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:16.150" style="s2"> Maybe there is still a long run-in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.100" style="s2"> The battle of the gods described by Mircea Iliad</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.100" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2"> If interested</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:22.700" style="s2"> You can read &quot;History of Religious Thought&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.825" end="00:37:24.050" style="s2"> I recommend you to read</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.050" end="00:37:25.075" style="s2"> This book has three volumes</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.175" end="00:37:27.950" style="s2"> Relatively easy to understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.950" end="00:37:29.400" style="s2"> For religious books</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.750" end="00:37:33.875" style="s2"> Eliade developed polytheism to monotheism</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.225" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2"> The process and reasons are explained clearly</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:38.300" style="s2"> Even in polytheism</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.375" end="00:37:42.300" style="s2"> The gods are also very inclined to build their own hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.300" end="00:37:44.025" style="s2"> And promoted a supreme god in power</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.550" end="00:37:46.900" style="s2"> In a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.900" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2"> Except for the most powerful god</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:50.350" style="s2"> The other gods are gone with time</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.875" end="00:37:52.600" style="s2"> But even in the polytheistic essay</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.600" end="00:37:54.775" style="s2"> There is also a hierarchy of power among the gods</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:58.650" style="s2"> The first chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot; is newer than the second chapter</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.650" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2"> The story I want to parse today</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:02.325" style="s2"> Longer than the one I said before</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.325" end="00:38:06.250" style="s2"> Although their order was reversed by the editor</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.250" end="00:38:07.550" style="s2"> This editor is hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.550" end="00:38:08.500" style="s2"> Maybe a group of editors</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.500" end="00:38:09.750" style="s2"> They collected these stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.750" end="00:38:14.750" style="s2"> I think it’s unlikely that there is only one person who knows</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.300" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2"> We still don’t know why these stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:21.375" style="s2"> Are arranged in this order</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.825" end="00:38:25.525" style="s2"> But we can infer this arrangement order</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.525" end="00:38:28.050" style="s2"> Is a reasonable order considered by the editor</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.050" end="00:38:29.500" style="s2"> This is the editor’s job</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.500" end="00:38:33.650" style="s2"> Edited different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.650" end="00:38:35.700" style="s2"> Arrange in a reasonable order</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.975" end="00:38:37.950" style="s2"> Reasonable order means</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.950" end="00:38:39.025" style="s2"> You can tell people these thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.025" end="00:38:40.675" style="s2"> Keep them interested</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.850" end="00:38:43.775" style="s2"> And let them remember these points</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.200" end="00:38:47.225" style="s2"> This is also one of the reasonable standards for determining your argument</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.250" end="00:38:50.250" style="s2"> Because your argument is communicable, understandable and memorable</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.650" end="00:38:55.025" style="s2"> We can say it is driven by intuition</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.025" end="00:38:57.850" style="s2"> This person arranges these stories in this order</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.050" end="00:39:04.450" style="s2"> The Jehovah Document contains</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.450" end="00:39:06.625" style="s2"> The classic story of the Torah</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.625" end="00:39:08.900" style="s2"> &quot;Genesis&quot; &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;Leviticus&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.900" end="00:39:10.225" style="s2"> &quot;Numbers&quot; &quot;Deuteronomy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.900" end="00:39:13.975" style="s2"> I hope that in these 12 lectures we can all talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.975" end="00:39:15.275" style="s2"> Let&#39;s watch while walking</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.275" end="00:39:16.700" style="s2"> There are many personifications in the Jehovah literature</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.125" end="00:39:18.925" style="s2"> So the God in Jehovah’s documents</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.050" end="00:39:21.550" style="s2"> In a sense, it’s a &quot;yuan man&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.075" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2"> I read a little bit last week</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2"> People tend to think this is imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.075" end="00:39:29.900" style="s2"> But you think so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.250" end="00:39:33.950" style="s2"> Mind is the foundation of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.500" end="00:39:36.500" style="s2"> Is the most complicated thing we know</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.375" end="00:39:39.400" style="s2"> Then imagine this most complicated thing like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.400" end="00:39:42.425" style="s2"> Not so perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.425" end="00:39:43.850" style="s2"> At least this is people&#39;s exhaustion of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.850" end="00:39:44.850" style="s2"> The best result you can get</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.625" end="00:39:51.175" style="s2"> So i don&#39;t think it is imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.375" end="00:39:52.250" style="s2"> It can be inferred from this</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.050" end="00:39:54.375" style="s2"> Very practically</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.375" end="00:39:56.025" style="s2"> The following ideas are also very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.050" end="00:39:58.200" style="s2"> That the Father is from</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.200" end="00:40:03.100" style="s2"> The spirit that rises from the crowd and continues into the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2"> When we discuss the concept of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.850" end="00:40:07.775" style="s2"> Involved some</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.025" end="00:40:09.325" style="s2"> Or we will talk about this later</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.575" end="00:40:11.350" style="s2"> You will sacrifice the present</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.350" end="00:40:13.175" style="s2"> Let yourself be more satisfied in the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.525" end="00:40:14.393" style="s2"> But the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.393" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2"> What kind of future will satisfy you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.175" end="00:40:20.675" style="s2"> The answer is the spirit of all mankind</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.675" end="00:40:22.450" style="s2"> This is what you negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.525" end="00:40:24.050" style="s2"> You can make an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.150" end="00:40:26.325" style="s2"> If you sacrifice willful play</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.325" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2"> Go all out to get a medical degree</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.025" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2"> Ten years later when you become a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.600" end="00:40:36.425" style="s2"> Human society will respect your dedication and commitment</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.425" end="00:40:37.825" style="s2"> And open the door to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.875" end="00:40:41.250" style="s2"> You not only treat the future as an independent being</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.250" end="00:40:45.325" style="s2"> Treat it as a compassionate judge</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.350" end="00:40:46.850" style="s2"> You are putting it into practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.950" end="00:40:52.475" style="s2"> Maybe before we start to understand that there is a future</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.475" end="00:40:55.125" style="s2"> You have to imagine God as an ununderstood form</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.175" end="00:40:58.100" style="s2"> Maybe think of God as such a form</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.125" end="00:41:00.625" style="s2"> We can make things concrete and deal with them</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.650" end="00:41:02.975" style="s2"> We can learn how to use sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.975" end="00:41:04.825" style="s2"> To understand how to guide us into the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.875" end="00:41:07.475" style="s2"> Sacrifice is a contract with the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.475" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2"> Not a contract with a specific person</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.625" end="00:41:14.625" style="s2"> Is a contract with all mankind</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.625" end="00:41:16.450" style="s2"> When you think in this way</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.450" end="00:41:19.225" style="s2"> It will give you an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.250" end="00:41:21.400" style="s2"> Because this is a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.425" end="00:41:24.050" style="s2"> Allows you to bargain with the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.050" end="00:41:25.825" style="s2"> This idea is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.350" end="00:41:29.625" style="s2"> It’s the most important idea for us as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:31.575" style="s2"> What to do if we suffer</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.575" end="00:41:33.425" style="s2"> We have to figure out how to discuss with the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.425" end="00:41:36.125" style="s2"> And use this method to minimize our suffering</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.200" end="00:41:38.150" style="s2"> No other animal can do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.275" end="00:41:39.925" style="s2"> The lion only has what to eat</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.925" end="00:41:43.475" style="s2"> A wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.475" end="00:41:45.250" style="s2"> Eat as long as there is meat</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:48.200" style="s2"> I won’t say save some mammoth for tomorrow.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.875" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2"> Wolves won’t do this, but humans will</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.925" end="00:41:54.775" style="s2"> That means you may be starving today</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.775" end="00:41:59.007" style="s2"> Imagine you are a farmer 6000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.075" end="00:42:01.725" style="s2"> At the beginning of the farming civilization, you were about to starve to death</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.725" end="00:42:03.425" style="s2"> Looking forward to spring ploughing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.425" end="00:42:06.325" style="s2"> You know you better not touch those seeds</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.525" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2"> This ability is very important to control the present self</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:11.575" style="s2"> Let the future come true</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.575" end="00:42:13.650" style="s2"> And postpone what you can enjoy now</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.650" end="00:42:15.400" style="s2"> Instead of using it on impulse</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.425" end="00:42:17.550" style="s2"> Maybe your child is starving to death</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.550" end="00:42:21.575" style="s2"> You still can’t touch the seeds you will use in the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.575" end="00:42:23.600" style="s2"> For mankind to realize that there is a future</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.600" end="00:42:26.150" style="s2"> And the ability to plan for the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.200" end="00:42:29.175" style="s2"> This is too important i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:32.225" style="s2"> In fact, at least part of the story in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.225" end="00:42:35.425" style="s2"> Describes the birth process of this ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.425" end="00:42:39.325" style="s2"> Jehovah&#39;s documentation begins in chapter 2 section 4 of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.425" end="00:42:41.650" style="s2"> &quot;This is how the world was created&quot; (Genesis 2:4)</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.650" end="00:42:44.325" style="s2"> There are two true creation stories at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.325" end="00:42:45.900" style="s2"> The later one is the first one</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.900" end="00:42:47.850" style="s2"> The longer one is the second</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.975" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2"> The Jiuyuan Edition starts with Chapter 2 of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.575" style="s2"> Which is what we are going to talk about next</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:56.037" style="s2"> Including Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.037" end="00:42:57.825" style="s2"> Noah Babel</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.450" end="00:43:00.150" style="s2"> Chapters in Jehovah&#39;s Documents</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:01.450" style="s2"> &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;Numbers&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.450" end="00:43:03.375" style="s2"> There are also some priest documents</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.375" end="00:43:04.875" style="s2"> The Ten Commandments are also included</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.075" end="00:43:10.650" style="s2"> There are many vivid descriptions of heaven</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.825" end="00:43:15.350" style="s2"> This is &quot;The Paradise on Earth&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.375" end="00:43:16.725" style="s2"> I forgot what the author was called</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.975" end="00:43:18.950" style="s2"> Boss</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.950" end="00:43:20.375" style="s2"> To Jeronimos Boss</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.375" end="00:43:21.050" style="s2"> A madman</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.075" end="00:43:26.475" style="s2"> I can&#39;t understand why he was not burned to death on the stake</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.550" end="00:43:31.044" style="s2"> Most of you know Salvador Dali</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.100" end="00:43:33.700" style="s2"> He is insignificant compared to Boss</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.750" end="00:43:44.050" style="s2"> You might spend a whole month</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.075" end="00:43:45.475" style="s2"> Observe this painting with a weird and outrageous feeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.500" end="00:43:47.175" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what happened to Boss</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.175" end="00:43:50.325" style="s2"> But he is the kind of creature that only appears once in history</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.350" end="00:43:52.025" style="s2"> This may be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.275" end="00:43:57.909" style="s2"> There have always been many expressions about heaven</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.925" end="00:43:59.525" style="s2"> God knows what heaven means in this painting</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.325" end="00:44:04.175" style="s2"> I can only guess at best but I won’t do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.100" end="00:44:09.100" style="s2"> There is a lion lying among the sheep</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.100" end="00:44:10.275" style="s2"> Here is such a concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.275" end="00:44:13.750" style="s2"> Reflects the past</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.750" end="00:44:14.975" style="s2"> Or maybe at some point in the future</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.975" end="00:44:17.225" style="s2"> Fear of survival</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.225" end="00:44:20.375" style="s2"> There is no need for life itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.125" end="00:44:23.800" style="s2"> And the scary thing about life is of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.800" end="00:44:25.175" style="s2"> It&#39;s the eclipse of everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:27.675" style="s2"> All things perish and all things are reborn</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.675" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2"> The whole land is a morgue</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.025" end="00:44:32.250" style="s2"> Full of disasters from beginning to end</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.325" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2"> This fantasy is the exact opposite of the previous one</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:38.775" style="s2"> Have a very deep thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.775" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2"> This idea is also implicit in one of the alchemy ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:45.525" style="s2"> I think it is also one of the ideas implicit in the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.100" end="00:44:49.750" style="s2"> Interact with reality with this thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.750" end="00:44:53.125" style="s2"> Humans can reduce tragedy and depravity</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.125" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2"> To be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:44:58.925" style="s2"> This is obviously imagist</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.925" end="00:45:00.600" style="s2"> Maybe we can get closer to the place transformed by this thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.625" end="00:45:03.075" style="s2"> Where we enjoy the benefits of actual existence</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.075" end="00:45:06.375" style="s2"> Without any disaster</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.375" end="00:45:11.325" style="s2"> When Jung wrote that science begins with alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.325" end="00:45:14.100" style="s2"> He believes that science is driven by dreams</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.100" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2"> For Jung, dream is the embodiment of instinct</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2"> It exists at the boundary between instinct and mind</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.475" end="00:45:24.525" style="s2"> Dream is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.525" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2"> If we are fully focused and sincere</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:29.575" style="s2"> To observe the structure of physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.625" end="00:45:33.650" style="s2"> Can understand material reality and reduce suffering</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.550" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2"> May let us find such a theme</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.225" end="00:45:56.075" style="s2"> Or put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.125" end="00:45:59.250" style="s2"> To provide the driving force for the development of science</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.300" end="00:46:01.900" style="s2"> Jung put the power of development</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.900" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2"> Going back more than 1,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.750" end="00:46:05.850" style="s2"> If you are interested in reading his book about alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.850" end="00:46:07.450" style="s2"> Those books are extremely difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.500" end="00:46:09.125" style="s2"> It also confirms the profound knowledge of Jung</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.125" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2"> Because his books are hard to read</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:14.125" style="s2"> It can be said that books on alchemy have taken a quantum leap</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.125" end="00:46:15.625" style="s2"> That seems to be a &quot;small&quot; leap</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.625" end="00:46:16.775" style="s2"> I shouldn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.775" end="00:46:18.850" style="s2"> It should be said that these books have taken a big step</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.850" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2"> Stepped into a completely different complex latitude</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:22.350" style="s2"> But this is also the latitude Jung tried to step into</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.350" end="00:46:25.375" style="s2"> He reinterpreted alchemy literature</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.375" end="00:46:28.075" style="s2"> As if they are dreams established by science</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.075" end="00:46:30.250" style="s2"> By the way, Newton was also an alchemist</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.350" end="00:46:35.625" style="s2"> The hypothesis put forward by Jung is well confirmed by history</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.650" end="00:46:37.350" style="s2"> The birth of science really began with alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.350" end="00:46:39.725" style="s2"> The question is what does alchemy do</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.725" end="00:46:41.650" style="s2"> They try to refine the sage stone</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.650" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2"> This is also the panacea pursued by human pathology</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:47.250" style="s2"> Jung felt that what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.275" end="00:46:50.350" style="s2"> Christianity promised to stop suffering</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.350" end="00:46:51.775" style="s2"> Said it for more than 1,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.775" end="00:46:53.825" style="s2"> The pain has not been abated yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:55.675" style="s2"> Simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.675" end="00:46:59.300" style="s2"> Christianity tried to really value spiritual construction</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.325" end="00:47:02.075" style="s2"> For example, at the expense of material development</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.075" end="00:47:05.425" style="s2"> Treat it as something similar to sin</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.425" end="00:47:08.150" style="s2"> Try to restrain impulse</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.150" end="00:47:11.750" style="s2"> All of these are accompanied by the existence of a twin</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.775" end="00:47:12.975" style="s2"> There is a reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.975" end="00:47:17.914" style="s2"> European minds around 1000 AD</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.925" end="00:47:19.950" style="s2"> Got some education</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.950" end="00:47:22.125" style="s2"> And be able to focus on a single point</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.125" end="00:47:26.575" style="s2"> Maybe because of long and intensive religious training</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.575" end="00:47:31.150" style="s2"> Pull down religious dreams from the unexplored material world</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.175" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2"> Europeans think about it then</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.450" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2"> The spiritual salvation we have been pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:36.575" style="s2"> Does not seem to make promises and expected results</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.575" end="00:47:37.850" style="s2"> Achieved</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.850" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2"> Maybe we should seek answers in another place</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.025" style="s2"> And the answer lies in the cursed world of material desire</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.025" end="00:47:45.600" style="s2"> that place</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.600" end="00:47:48.650" style="s2"> At least based on the traditional perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.650" end="00:47:50.675" style="s2"> Just a place to create demons</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:54.075" style="s2"> What i want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.100" end="00:47:57.875" style="s2"> People have many motivations, it’s hard to underestimate their number</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.875" end="00:48:02.225" style="s2"> These motives are deeply rooted in people&#39;s attempts to relieve pain</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.225" end="00:48:03.850" style="s2"> People try to eradicate the disease</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2"> Help others lead a healthy life</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:10.875" style="s2"> Reduce disease health and longevity</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.900" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2"> Do things in a peaceful manner as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:14.750" style="s2"> You can say that the world does not speak morality, justice and self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.750" end="00:48:16.875" style="s2"> You can also say that they are all driven by power</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.875" end="00:48:17.775" style="s2"> Corruption</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.800" end="00:48:19.900" style="s2"> All these things are right</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.900" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2"> But you shouldn’t totally deny human beings for this flaw</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.425" end="00:48:25.150" style="s2"> Because we worked hard for a long time to get things right</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.150" end="00:48:28.100" style="s2"> What we have achieved today is already very good</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.100" end="00:48:30.125" style="s2"> For our half-hungry state of madness</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.125" end="00:48:31.375" style="s2"> Insect-ridden</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.375" end="00:48:34.675" style="s2"> And for chimpanzees with a life span of only 50 to 70 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.975" end="00:48:37.525" style="s2"> For the status of human beings today</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.525" end="00:48:38.700" style="s2"> We deserve a little sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.700" end="00:48:39.975" style="s2"> What you want me to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.625" end="00:48:50.575" style="s2"> Some other explanations about heaven</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.575" end="00:48:51.550" style="s2"> I like this picture</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.550" end="00:48:52.525" style="s2"> This one on the left</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.525" end="00:48:54.975" style="s2"> Heaven is a garden in a trap</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.975" end="00:48:56.125" style="s2"> The meaning of heaven is the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.125" end="00:48:58.025" style="s2"> From the word &quot;parádeisos&quot; it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.175" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2"> Don&#39;t remember what language it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.925" end="00:49:02.950" style="s2"> Anyway related to Persian</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.100" end="00:49:05.025" style="s2"> &quot;Parádeisos&quot; means garden</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.025" end="00:49:06.700" style="s2"> Why is it a garden?</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.700" end="00:49:08.325" style="s2"> We have to go back to the concept of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.325" end="00:49:09.100" style="s2"> After creation</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.125" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2"> God put men and women in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2"> Entrapment means culture and order, garden means nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:18.225" style="s2"> Illustrates a place suitable for human habitation</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.225" end="00:49:20.100" style="s2"> Is a place where nature and civilization strike a balance</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.100" end="00:49:21.925" style="s2"> We like the garden why</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:24.900" style="s2"> Because the garden is not completely covered by weeds and mosquitoes</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.900" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2"> Covered by flies, right</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.425" end="00:49:28.100" style="s2"> So the garden is more or less civilized</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.100" end="00:49:30.275" style="s2"> But in this civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.450" end="00:49:34.350" style="s2"> Nature thrives with a more kind and benevolent attitude</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.350" end="00:49:36.450" style="s2"> People think this idea is full of life</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.600" end="00:49:39.825" style="s2"> I feel &quot;Heaven, a livable place for humans</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.825" end="00:49:41.800" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s a garden&quot; This idea is good</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.800" end="00:49:44.575" style="s2"> There is a wall because you want to block something out</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.575" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2"> For example raccoon</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:48.850" style="s2"> You want to keep it out even if it’s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.825" end="00:49:52.957" style="s2"> There must be various things</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.957" end="00:49:54.475" style="s2"> You don’t want them to appear in the garden like snakes</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.550" end="00:49:57.150" style="s2"> If you want to come in, the wall doesn&#39;t seem to be able to stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.150" end="00:50:00.900" style="s2"> But the idea that &quot;heaven is a garden&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.175" end="00:50:07.025" style="s2"> Echoes the concept of chaos and order at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.025" end="00:50:10.200" style="s2"> The wall is the civilized garden is the nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.250" end="00:50:14.650" style="s2"> The ideal human habitat is like a well-tended garden</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.650" end="00:50:21.375" style="s2"> Radical leftist anti-theist environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.700" end="00:50:23.275" style="s2"> Tend to prove</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.300" end="00:50:28.350" style="s2"> The plunder of Western capitalism is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.375" end="00:50:30.475" style="s2"> The consequences of humans following an instruction</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.475" end="00:50:34.875" style="s2"> In &quot;Genesis&quot;, God gave mankind</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.875" end="00:50:37.800" style="s2"> The command is to go out and dominate the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.825" end="00:50:40.750" style="s2"> David Suzuki also talked a lot about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.475" end="00:50:45.400" style="s2"> They believe this statement makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.475" end="00:50:49.600" style="s2"> We wished</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.600" end="00:50:52.450" style="s2"> The right to control the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.450" end="00:50:56.975" style="s2"> This statement turned humans into terrible carnivorous monsters</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.975" end="00:51:00.450" style="s2"> Sometimes humans are described as tumors on the surface of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.450" end="00:51:03.425" style="s2"> Or viruses that parasitize the entire ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.425" end="00:51:05.950" style="s2"> Not only did not build on the earth, but also wandered around all day</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.950" end="00:51:08.650" style="s2"> Mess everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.650" end="00:51:14.050" style="s2"> This is another perspective on human nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.075" end="00:51:17.150" style="s2"> But I think it must be strongly condemned</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.150" end="00:51:21.425" style="s2"> If you look at the history</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.425" end="00:51:22.300" style="s2"> You will find</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.300" end="00:51:27.350" style="s2"> By the end of the 19th century Thomas Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.350" end="00:51:28.775" style="s2"> Grandpa of Aldous Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:30.875" style="s2"> Darwin&#39;s big supporter</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.875" end="00:51:35.750" style="s2"> Wrote a report to the British government for the sustainability of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.750" end="00:51:39.100" style="s2"> The conclusion he gave is to fish as much as you like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.175" end="00:51:41.425" style="s2"> There are thousands of fish in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.425" end="00:51:43.150" style="s2"> The resources of the ocean are inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.150" end="00:51:47.025" style="s2"> No matter how many years humans try their best to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.075" end="00:51:50.050" style="s2"> Have an impact on marine ecology</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.100" end="00:51:51.375" style="s2"> The possibility can only be zero</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.400" end="00:51:53.950" style="s2"> Now things prove Huxley wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.950" end="00:51:57.125" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t expect that the population would surge like a magic</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.125" end="00:51:59.250" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that we have become richer</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.300" end="00:52:02.625" style="s2"> The newborn will never be like before</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.650" end="00:52:04.025" style="s2"> The infant mortality rate is as high as 60% before reaching their first birthday</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.050" end="00:52:07.075" style="s2"> Even if only a few people</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.075" end="00:52:08.025" style="s2"> We can thrive</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.050" end="00:52:11.488" style="s2"> We only realized in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.500" end="00:52:12.375" style="s2"> We have too much population</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.375" end="00:52:14.100" style="s2"> Must start paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.175" end="00:52:15.700" style="s2"> What we do to the earth</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.700" end="00:52:17.900" style="s2"> This is 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.900" end="00:52:21.275" style="s2"> We just started to develop technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.275" end="00:52:22.200" style="s2"> And the necessary technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.200" end="00:52:26.325" style="s2"> To understand that the whole world should be considered a garden</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.325" end="00:52:33.325" style="s2"> We have to find the balance between civilization and chaos inside</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.725" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2"> before this</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.325" style="s2"> We just tried our best to survive</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.475" end="00:52:40.725" style="s2"> And usually fail</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.925" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2"> So I don’t agree with this interpretation of the beginning of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:50.325" style="s2"> I do not believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.325" end="00:52:51.900" style="s2"> Human beings are empowered on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.925" end="00:52:54.325" style="s2"> To act as a super predator</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.325" end="00:52:55.425" style="s2"> On the contrary I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.425" end="00:52:58.075" style="s2"> Compare the garden to a suitable habitat for humans</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.075" end="00:53:00.125" style="s2"> Is quite appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.125" end="00:53:01.825" style="s2"> People&#39;s role</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.825" end="00:53:04.475" style="s2"> It is also clearly stated in the second story</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.475" end="00:53:06.325" style="s2"> Adam and Eve are looking after the garden</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.425" end="00:53:09.325" style="s2"> Illustrate the appropriate choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.325" end="00:53:11.800" style="s2"> Let everything thrive and thrive</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.800" end="00:53:15.825" style="s2"> Not only good for other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.825" end="00:53:17.425" style="s2"> Good for humans too</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.475" end="00:53:19.950" style="s2"> I think now we at least</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.950" end="00:53:23.925" style="s2"> Can notice what is commonly proposed today</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.925" end="00:53:26.825" style="s2"> Compared to the final cynical interpretation of this story</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.825" end="00:53:28.975" style="s2"> This is just a slightly different angle of interpretation of the story</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.050" end="00:53:34.125" style="s2"> There are several trees in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.125" end="00:53:37.350" style="s2"> There are Adam and Eve, some animals and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.350" end="00:53:40.241" style="s2"> Unfortunately this tree happened to be entangled by a snake</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.241" end="00:53:41.575" style="s2"> This is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.575" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2"> Next we will have a lot of discussion about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.925" end="00:53:47.025" style="s2"> Snakes are unusual in both pictures</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.025" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2"> It has a human head</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2"> The one in the other picture also has a human head</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.075" end="00:53:52.200" style="s2"> No matter what kind of snake it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.250" end="00:53:56.769" style="s2"> Don’t look at it from a religious perspective</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.875" end="00:53:58.950" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t do it, imagine you are a anthropologist</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.950" end="00:54:00.575" style="s2"> You have never seen this painting</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.600" end="00:54:01.925" style="s2"> What do you see at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.925" end="00:54:06.350" style="s2"> You see the wall and a very comfortable enclosed space</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.350" end="00:54:07.550" style="s2"> Then you see a tree</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.550" end="00:54:08.900" style="s2"> People are eating from the tree</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.900" end="00:54:11.050" style="s2"> There is a snake with a human head on the tree</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.050" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2"> You might wonder why this snake has a human head</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:15.850" style="s2"> Then you will think</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.925" end="00:54:17.025" style="s2"> This is half snake and half human</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.025" end="00:54:19.875" style="s2"> This hardly reveals anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.900" end="00:54:20.775" style="s2"> It speaks for itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.825" end="00:54:22.275" style="s2"> So no matter what it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.275" end="00:54:23.125" style="s2"> Anyway, it&#39;s not just a snake</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:24.850" style="s2"> It is a snake and a human</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.900" end="00:54:29.025" style="s2"> Or a snake but some of the characteristics of a human</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.025" end="00:54:31.600" style="s2"> This is very important we will analyze next</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.600" end="00:54:33.275" style="s2"> Here you see the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.475" end="00:54:36.775" style="s2"> In this picture you can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.775" end="00:54:38.175" style="s2"> There is a head there</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.175" end="00:54:39.850" style="s2"> This snake has two wings</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.900" end="00:54:42.825" style="s2"> This is a snake with wings a bit like a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.875" end="00:54:45.275" style="s2"> Can crawl on the ground like a reptile</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.275" end="00:54:48.166" style="s2"> It has a flying animal side or a spiritual side</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.166" end="00:54:51.875" style="s2"> This snake is like the lowest form of reptile life</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.900" end="00:54:53.325" style="s2"> Is something crawling on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.325" end="00:54:56.375" style="s2"> It&#39;s a human body and a spirit body</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.375" end="00:54:58.150" style="s2"> It perches on this tree</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.175" end="00:55:00.475" style="s2"> This tree looks a lot like hallucinogenic mushrooms by the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.475" end="00:55:03.925" style="s2"> If you want to know, you can check</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.925" end="00:55:06.150" style="s2"> This theme is also unique</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.150" end="00:55:07.475" style="s2"> If you are curious about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.475" end="00:55:09.825" style="s2"> But there is another thought here</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.825" end="00:55:12.650" style="s2"> That is, there was such a thing in the garden at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.675" end="00:55:14.650" style="s2"> This thing is like a snake and a person</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.650" end="00:55:17.900" style="s2"> This thing has wings and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.900" end="00:55:20.741" style="s2"> So it is a combination of spiritual humans and reptiles</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.741" end="00:55:24.350" style="s2"> It is also the vivid spirit of this tree</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.450" end="00:55:26.525" style="s2"> Well remember this</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.725" end="00:55:29.950" style="s2"> &quot;Heaven and earth are made&quot; (Genesis 2:1)</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.975" end="00:55:31.775" style="s2"> This is related to the first chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.850" end="00:55:32.950" style="s2"> &quot;All things are made together&quot; (Genesis 2:1)</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.950" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2"> &quot;By the seventh day</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.250" end="00:55:36.900" style="s2"> &quot;Just stopped all his work on the seventh day</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.900" end="00:55:38.325" style="s2"> &quot;Rest in peace</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.325" end="00:55:39.875" style="s2"> &quot;God bless the seventh day</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.875" end="00:55:40.575" style="s2"> &quot;Sacred Day</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.675" end="00:55:43.350" style="s2"> &quot;Because on this day God stopped all the work of creation</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.350" end="00:55:44.575" style="s2"> &quot;Rest in peace&quot; (Gen 2:3)</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.575" end="00:55:47.450" style="s2"> The concept of the Sabbath is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.450" end="00:55:52.025" style="s2"> I have worked with a lot of people who work too hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.025" end="00:55:54.275" style="s2"> The problem with overly serious people is</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.275" end="00:55:55.875" style="s2"> They will work till they die</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.025" end="00:55:57.575" style="s2"> This actually does not make them highly efficient</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.600" end="00:55:59.525" style="s2"> Because they can&#39;t work if they die</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.600" end="00:56:02.475" style="s2"> What you have to do to them is you have to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.475" end="00:56:04.225" style="s2"> I know you don&#39;t want to do anything except work</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.250" end="00:56:06.475" style="s2"> Maybe when you are not working</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.475" end="00:56:07.600" style="s2"> You will sink into guilt</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.600" end="00:56:09.175" style="s2"> But first figure out what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.175" end="00:56:11.000" style="s2"> What you are doing is doing everything possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.000" end="00:56:14.875" style="s2"> Try with least doubt</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.875" end="00:56:16.425" style="s2"> Use the longest sustainable time</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.425" end="00:56:17.800" style="s2"> Possible ways to work efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.800" end="00:56:19.850" style="s2"> That may mean you need to rest</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.475" end="00:56:23.225" style="s2"> I used to work with lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.225" end="00:56:26.100" style="s2"> They have risen to the top of a large law firm</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.100" end="00:56:27.975" style="s2"> Are the kind of people who work super efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.975" end="00:56:29.803" style="s2"> They often try to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.825" end="00:56:32.125" style="s2"> Their impossible annual working hour quota</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.425" end="00:56:35.875" style="s2"> In the end, I made myself burnt</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.875" end="00:56:37.700" style="s2"> One of our actions for this situation is</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.725" end="00:56:40.700" style="s2"> It won’t work for them to reduce the number of working days</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.750" end="00:56:43.125" style="s2"> But we will let them extend their rest time</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.150" end="00:56:45.425" style="s2"> For example, take a four-day weekend every two months</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.500" end="00:56:47.975" style="s2"> Help them plan their work and rest schedule</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.975" end="00:56:49.775" style="s2"> We will track and study their charging time</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.775" end="00:56:51.375" style="s2"> Because this is their productivity</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.375" end="00:56:52.500" style="s2"> The result is that their charging time has really improved</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.500" end="00:56:55.100" style="s2"> This is great because you can tell workaholics</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.150" end="00:56:57.975" style="s2"> Rest</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.975" end="00:56:58.975" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.075" end="00:57:02.175" style="s2"> Because it will make your work more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.225" end="00:57:03.725" style="s2"> No this is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.775" end="00:57:05.375" style="s2"> I should always try my best to work</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.375" end="00:57:06.694" style="s2"> Then test it</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.694" end="00:57:07.900" style="s2"> You take a break every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:10.275" style="s2"> As a result, their work efficiency has increased</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.275" end="00:57:11.650" style="s2"> Usually 10%</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.650" end="00:57:14.325" style="s2"> So resting is also a kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.275" end="00:57:18.600" style="s2"> This is the end of Chapter One</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.600" end="00:57:19.425" style="s2"> Foreshadowing the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.425" end="00:57:22.350" style="s2"> You have self-awareness, you explore the future</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.350" end="00:57:23.575" style="s2"> You have to work</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.575" end="00:57:25.754" style="s2"> The question is how much do you have to work</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.754" end="00:57:26.850" style="s2"> One answer is</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.850" end="00:57:28.425" style="s2"> You better work hard all the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.425" end="00:57:30.000" style="s2"> Because no matter how much you work</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.000" end="00:57:31.650" style="s2"> You can&#39;t solve your problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.875" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2"> Problems will always come</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:35.025" style="s2"> You can save a bunch of money you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.025" end="00:57:36.425" style="s2"> You can save a bunch of whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.425" end="00:57:38.775" style="s2"> But in the end none of these things can protect you</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.775" end="00:57:40.750" style="s2"> So you&#39;d better keep your feet on the ground and work hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.750" end="00:57:42.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s best to do your best all the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.450" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2"> What will happen if you do</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:45.175" style="s2"> You will die</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.175" end="00:57:47.375" style="s2"> That&#39;s not a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.375" end="00:57:48.650" style="s2"> So maybe you should rest</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.650" end="00:57:52.025" style="s2"> How to put rest into practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.700" end="00:57:55.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to say but there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.775" end="00:57:56.950" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk about it conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.950" end="00:58:00.050" style="s2"> Even God has to take one day off every week</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.050" end="00:58:03.050" style="s2"> So you don’t have to assume that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.100" end="00:58:05.075" style="s2"> If God had to take one day off every week</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.075" end="00:58:13.175" style="s2"> Then you have to work non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.300" end="00:58:16.194" style="s2"> I think our culture has been in a rather dangerous way</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.200" end="00:58:17.675" style="s2"> Embarked on this astray</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.725" end="00:58:19.225" style="s2"> Every place is open all day long</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.225" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2"> But like you guys, I also find it very convenient</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.050" end="00:58:25.475" style="s2"> It’s weird to talk to modern people</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.475" end="00:58:27.475" style="s2"> The one thing they tell you most is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.485" end="00:58:28.225" style="s2"> We asked &quot;how are you&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.225" end="00:58:29.275" style="s2"> What do they often say</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.300" end="00:58:30.900" style="s2"> They don’t say “good” or “bad”</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.900" end="00:58:32.125" style="s2"> They will say &quot;busy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.125" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2"> Speechless</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.125" end="00:58:39.225" style="s2"> Well, the second chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot; starts here</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.225" end="00:58:40.600" style="s2"> Finally here</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.600" end="00:58:43.300" style="s2"> &quot;The origin of the creation of heaven and earth</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.875" end="00:58:45.025" style="s2"> &quot;On the day when the Lord God made the heavens and the earth</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.025" end="00:58:47.375" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s it&quot; (Genesis 2:4)</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.975" end="01:00:01.725" style="s2"> This is especially meaningful</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.950" end="01:00:10.950" style="s2"> This garden is the Paradise of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.950" end="01:00:12.500" style="s2"> Where there is sufficient water</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.500" end="01:00:14.600" style="s2"> Water has the characteristics of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.650" end="01:00:16.950" style="s2"> We learned early in the first chapter of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.000" end="01:00:19.950" style="s2"> The underlying chaos is usually considered similar to water</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.950" end="01:00:21.475" style="s2"> Is a symbol of water</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.825" end="01:00:23.725" style="s2"> The same idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.725" end="01:00:26.450" style="s2"> A certain amount of chaos must transform it into order</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.450" end="01:00:27.525" style="s2"> So that chaos can become fruitful</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.525" end="01:00:31.275" style="s2"> You know that all the fruits are nourished by water</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.275" end="01:00:34.600" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground</p>

<p begin="01:00:41.700" end="01:00:44.475" style="s2"> So these two trees are divided</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.475" end="01:00:46.325" style="s2"> Among them is the tree of life</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.325" end="01:00:48.825" style="s2"> And the tree of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.875" end="01:00:52.350" style="s2"> When you are reading this kind of stuff, if you think</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.350" end="01:00:54.350" style="s2"> You enter the category of metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.350" end="01:00:56.725" style="s2"> We have to be cautious about metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.725" end="01:00:58.275" style="s2"> Because i can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.275" end="01:00:58.875" style="s2"> I did say</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.900" end="01:01:01.800" style="s2"> The idea of ​​chaos and order is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.850" end="01:01:04.025" style="s2"> I also said to think carefully</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.025" end="01:01:04.800" style="s2"> Although this is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.800" end="01:01:06.775" style="s2"> But this is also a way of thinking that your brain adapts to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.775" end="01:01:09.400" style="s2"> Let&#39;s stop playing tricks in this way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.400" end="01:01:11.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s just a metaphor and nothing more</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.225" end="01:01:14.325" style="s2"> The same thing happened here</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.325" end="01:01:15.875" style="s2"> These are metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.875" end="01:01:19.500" style="s2"> The tree of life can distinguish good from evil</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.525" end="01:01:23.175" style="s2"> They are not just metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.175" end="01:01:26.350" style="s2"> Sometimes like I said before</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.350" end="01:01:28.575" style="s2"> If you are in a series of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.575" end="01:01:31.150" style="s2"> Use abstract thinking to propose a common factor</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.150" end="01:01:32.625" style="s2"> You can have enough confidence to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.625" end="01:01:34.200" style="s2"> The ratio of common factors extracted by abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.200" end="01:01:36.425" style="s2"> This series of things is more real</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.425" end="01:01:38.325" style="s2"> This is the practicality of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.350" end="01:01:39.725" style="s2"> Otherwise, why would you bother about it?</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.725" end="01:01:41.800" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t list these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.800" end="01:01:44.325" style="s2"> Cite this series of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.325" end="01:01:46.675" style="s2"> Commonality more important than differences</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.675" end="01:01:48.300" style="s2"> Then you don’t need abstract ability</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.375" end="01:01:51.000" style="s2"> The tree of life and the tree that distinguishes good from evil</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.000" end="01:01:52.175" style="s2"> Is the result of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.175" end="01:01:54.550" style="s2"> Now there is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.550" end="01:01:55.850" style="s2"> Hard question</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.850" end="01:01:58.050" style="s2"> I thought about it for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.050" end="01:02:01.300" style="s2"> Why a fruit or something you eat</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.325" end="01:02:05.250" style="s2"> Can be related to psychological changes</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.250" end="01:02:07.500" style="s2"> It happened in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.500" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2"> Why something you eat</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:11.625" style="s2"> Student of Eric Newman Jung</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.625" end="01:02:13.025" style="s2"> Have studied this on this</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.025" end="01:02:14.500" style="s2"> He gave a more appropriate explanation</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.500" end="01:02:19.500" style="s2"> He said we always know the act of eating</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.500" end="01:02:21.700" style="s2"> Especially when you are hungry or need food urgently</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.700" end="01:02:24.750" style="s2"> Can produce a quick mental change</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.750" end="01:02:26.775" style="s2"> This is worth noting some of you</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.775" end="01:02:29.475" style="s2"> Probably have had a grumpy partner or child</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.475" end="01:02:30.750" style="s2"> Everyone has experienced</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.750" end="01:02:35.497" style="s2"> When their temperament becomes erratic</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.497" end="01:02:38.761" style="s2"> Inexplicably cloudy and sunny</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.761" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2"> You just give them some food</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2"> Really I tell you it works very well</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:44.675" style="s2"> I often do this to my patients</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.675" end="01:02:46.225" style="s2"> They told me</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.225" end="01:02:47.900" style="s2"> They will get furious about a little bit of something</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.900" end="01:02:49.775" style="s2"> Well, let me say try this method for a week</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.775" end="01:02:51.475" style="s2"> When your temper becomes unreasonable</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.475" end="01:02:54.225" style="s2"> Eat a small cheese or peanut butter sandwich</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.225" end="01:02:56.825" style="s2"> Eat some high-protein and high-fat foods</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.825" end="01:02:59.250" style="s2"> Then wait ten minutes to see if you are normal</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.275" end="01:03:03.325" style="s2"> You will find that sanity comes back after eating</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.325" end="01:03:04.775" style="s2"> You can&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.775" end="01:03:06.600" style="s2"> How crazy people would be when hungry</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.600" end="01:03:10.600" style="s2"> This is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.600" end="01:03:15.225" style="s2"> Try if you skip breakfast</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.225" end="01:03:17.075" style="s2"> Your life will change</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.075" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2"> Here are some useful information</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:24.775" style="s2"> For those who are dissatisfied with society and ended up in prison</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.775" end="01:03:30.600" style="s2"> If you are in jail you want to get parole</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.600" end="01:03:32.500" style="s2"> You have to go to the judge</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.500" end="01:03:34.300" style="s2"> Tell him why you won&#39;t do it again</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.300" end="01:03:36.125" style="s2"> Here is a trick</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.125" end="01:03:37.975" style="s2"> What you have done is not that important</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:40.575" style="s2"> The promise you made is not important</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.600" end="01:03:41.535" style="s2"> The important thing is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.535" end="01:03:44.650" style="s2"> Did you see the judge before he had lunch or after lunch</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.650" end="01:03:46.875" style="s2"> If it was after the judge had lunch,</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.875" end="01:03:50.375" style="s2"> Your chances of getting parole will increase by 60%</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:53.275" style="s2"> Yes that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.300" end="01:03:56.250" style="s2"> So never when you are hungry</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.250" end="01:03:56.975" style="s2"> Argue with your partner</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.000" end="01:03:57.825" style="s2"> Or when they are hungry</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.825" end="01:03:59.700" style="s2"> Especially when you want something from them</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.700" end="01:04:01.217" style="s2"> Best to come here and have a sandwich</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.250" end="01:04:04.600" style="s2"> They will eat it and you are at your disposal</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.625" end="01:04:07.700" style="s2"> Don&#39;t think about it before they eat</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.675" end="01:04:14.525" style="s2"> So this idea is not unreasonable</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.525" end="01:04:17.625" style="s2"> There is a certain spirit in the food that can make you refreshed</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.675" end="01:04:19.275" style="s2"> Not only to refresh your body</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.275" end="01:04:20.825" style="s2"> Mentally too</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.825" end="01:04:23.350" style="s2"> Of course, other things can also achieve this effect</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.350" end="01:04:24.750" style="s2"> But they are not like food</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.750" end="01:04:27.050" style="s2"> Has a great influence on our spirit</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.050" end="01:04:28.600" style="s2"> Take alcohol for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.600" end="01:04:32.250" style="s2"> Dionysus</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.275" end="01:04:33.750" style="s2"> He is Bacchus</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.750" end="01:04:35.450" style="s2"> Bacchus takes over your body</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.450" end="01:04:38.525" style="s2"> And let you do all kinds of funny things that alcohol brings you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.525" end="01:04:40.700" style="s2"> An act that will make you regret it when you wake up the next day</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.700" end="01:04:44.950" style="s2"> So it has such a spiritual element</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.950" end="01:04:47.675" style="s2"> But going deeper</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.675" end="01:04:51.000" style="s2"> It connects food and information, which is great</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.000" end="01:04:54.625" style="s2"> The story of Adam and Eve shows</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.625" end="01:04:58.325" style="s2"> Fruits make psychological changes</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.350" end="01:05:01.125" style="s2"> So the tree of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.150" end="01:05:03.350" style="s2"> Is an abstract summary of all trees</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.400" end="01:05:06.675" style="s2"> It tries to tell you that there are commonalities between trees and trees</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.675" end="01:05:09.275" style="s2"> Fruit is the commonality of trees</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.275" end="01:05:11.475" style="s2"> Probably like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.475" end="01:05:15.800" style="s2"> You might call this commonality food</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.875" end="01:05:17.625" style="s2"> Although it&#39;s only a rough generalization, it doesn&#39;t lose sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.625" end="01:05:19.450" style="s2"> What’s cooler is in the whole food field</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.450" end="01:05:25.950" style="s2"> The most stable element is not food</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.000" end="01:05:28.625" style="s2"> But the information it contains</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.625" end="01:05:32.300" style="s2"> We use the same brain circuit to search for information</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.300" end="01:05:34.150" style="s2"> The brain circuit of squirrel searching for food is the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.150" end="01:05:35.850" style="s2"> It’s the same brain circuit as animals searching for food</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.850" end="01:05:37.950" style="s2"> Why is it the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.950" end="01:05:38.775" style="s2"> Because we understand</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.775" end="01:05:43.250" style="s2"> Knowing where to have food is more important than having food</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.250" end="01:05:47.475" style="s2"> Knowing where the food is the primary form of food</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.475" end="01:05:50.125" style="s2"> Information is meta food</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.125" end="01:05:52.900" style="s2"> This is why we are the collectors of information</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.150" end="01:05:54.975" style="s2"> Once you catch this point</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.975" end="01:05:58.775" style="s2"> This idea is rooted in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.775" end="01:05:59.916" style="s2"> No matter what the food form inside</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.916" end="01:06:01.741" style="s2"> What they eat is meta food</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.741" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2"> Some kind of information</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:06.304" style="s2"> We will exchange information with food, right</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.325" end="01:06:08.625" style="s2"> Imagine you are trapped by the highway</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.675" end="01:06:11.075" style="s2"> You open the hood</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.100" end="01:06:15.250" style="s2"> Found your car turned into a pile of scrap iron</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.250" end="01:06:16.500" style="s2"> You have no idea about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.525" end="01:06:18.675" style="s2"> Suddenly someone stopped next to you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.675" end="01:06:20.100" style="s2"> They are mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.100" end="01:06:21.516" style="s2"> They pointed to a device and said</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.516" end="01:06:22.666" style="s2"> You just put that wire back there</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.666" end="01:06:24.550" style="s2"> You will give him a sandwich right away, right</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.550" end="01:06:27.000" style="s2"> Or something else in return</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.000" end="01:06:28.625" style="s2"> You know what I mean because they provide you</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.625" end="01:06:30.425" style="s2"> Valuable information</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.425" end="01:06:33.100" style="s2"> Information is valuable because it gives you motivation</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.100" end="01:06:34.750" style="s2"> Information can power you</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.850" end="01:06:36.775" style="s2"> Otherwise, why would we bother about it?</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.800" end="01:06:39.600" style="s2"> So it’s the same with food providing power information</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.775" end="01:06:42.400" style="s2"> Food philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.500" end="01:06:44.525" style="s2"> That you can get from all the things you can eat</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.525" end="01:06:48.125" style="s2"> Furthermore, you can get from all sources of food</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.125" end="01:06:50.025" style="s2"> What is abstracted out is information</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.025" end="01:06:54.350" style="s2"> The tree in the story of Adam and Eve is the meta form of the tree</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.350" end="01:06:56.525" style="s2"> Not the normality of the tree</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.525" end="01:06:58.600" style="s2"> It’s like heaven is not a specific ordinary place</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.600" end="01:07:00.925" style="s2"> Just like Adam and Eve are not ordinary people</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.925" end="01:07:04.025" style="s2"> Like the logos used by God at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.025" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2"> Not just concepts</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.650" end="01:07:08.050" style="s2"> They are not just metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.050" end="01:07:09.650" style="s2"> Something deeper than metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.650" end="01:07:12.733" style="s2"> I think this is surreal</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.775" end="01:07:14.425" style="s2"> They are more real than what you see</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.425" end="01:07:16.950" style="s2"> More real than what you see</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.000" end="01:07:18.325" style="s2"> Many things are like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.325" end="01:07:19.850" style="s2"> The numbers are like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.850" end="01:07:22.625" style="s2"> Just because there is something more real than seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.625" end="01:07:25.175" style="s2"> Then you will think and do abstract refinement</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.375" end="01:07:27.675" style="s2"> So what is the real thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.675" end="01:07:29.775" style="s2"> This is also part of what we want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.025" end="01:07:32.475" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.475" end="01:07:33.525" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s pleasing to the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.925" end="01:07:34.725" style="s2"> &quot;The fruit on it is good for food</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.350" end="01:07:37.725" style="s2"> &quot;There is another tree of life in the garden</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.400" end="01:07:39.650" style="s2"> &quot;The Tree of Separation of Good and Evil&quot; (Genesis 2:9)</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.675" end="01:07:41.550" style="s2"> &quot;A river flows from Eden to nourish the garden</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.550" end="01:07:44.125" style="s2"> &quot;Divided into four paths from there&quot; (Gen 2:10)</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.525" end="01:07:46.975" style="s2"> There are a lot of conjectures here</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.650" end="01:07:50.700" style="s2"> Eden is also a holy city</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.850" end="01:07:52.250" style="s2"> This is another way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.250" end="01:07:53.000" style="s2"> Or Jerusalem</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.325" end="01:07:56.250" style="s2"> Or an ideal country may also be an ideal city</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.250" end="01:07:57.675" style="s2"> It may also be the ideal state of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.675" end="01:07:59.125" style="s2"> Or ideal mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.375" end="01:08:01.475" style="s2"> It&#39;s all of them superimposed together</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.925" end="01:08:07.675" style="s2"> This is an imaginary mandala form</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:10.375" style="s2"> Make up the structure of heaven</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.425" end="01:08:12.175" style="s2"> You will notice that it has this cross pattern</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.500" end="01:08:13.850" style="s2"> This is the Garden of Eden itself</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.850" end="01:08:16.225" style="s2"> This is the center of the Garden of Eden, this is the river</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.525" end="01:08:17.725" style="s2"> Those on the left are rivers, not snakes</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.750" end="01:08:19.050" style="s2"> Those are the rivers that flow from the garden</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.350" end="01:08:21.150" style="s2"> And they were transformed into representatives that Jung described as me</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.175" end="01:08:23.850" style="s2"> These mandala images</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.900" end="01:08:26.575" style="s2"> Will be the core element of the conscious being</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.575" end="01:08:30.250" style="s2"> Jung combined it with divinity</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.250" end="01:08:32.275" style="s2"> And the concept of holy city</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.175" end="01:08:35.200" style="s2"> I show you this</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.200" end="01:08:38.175" style="s2"> To present the concept of imaginary heaven</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.300" end="01:08:43.050" style="s2"> &quot;The first one is named Bisson</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.050" end="01:08:46.250" style="s2"> &quot;It surrounds the whole land of Havilah</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.250" end="01:08:46.925" style="s2"> &quot;There is gold&quot; (Genesis 2:11)</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.950" end="01:08:48.250" style="s2"> &quot;And the gold there is good</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.475" end="01:08:50.250" style="s2"> &quot;There are pearls and red agates there&quot; (Gen 2:12)</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.600" end="01:08:52.075" style="s2"> &quot;The name of the second river is Gihon</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.075" end="01:08:54.700" style="s2"> &quot;It surrounds the whole land of Cush&quot; (Gen 2:13)</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.950" end="01:08:56.700" style="s2"> &quot;The name of the third river is Tigris</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.800" end="01:09:01.400" style="s2"> &quot;It flows east of Assyria</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.425" end="01:09:02.800" style="s2"> &quot;The fourth river is the Euphrates&quot; (Gen 2:14)</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.525" end="01:09:06.625" style="s2"> There’s something weird about geography</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.000" end="01:09:08.200" style="s2"> Hybrid with mythical geography</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.600" end="01:09:10.675" style="s2"> You will find this often appears in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.425" end="01:09:12.750" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God will</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.250" end="01:09:14.525" style="s2"> &quot;Placed in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.050" end="01:09:16.225" style="s2"> &quot;Make him repair the guard&quot; (Gen 2.15)</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.775" end="01:09:18.950" style="s2"> This is a good command</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.950" end="01:09:19.800" style="s2"> That&#39;s what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.325" end="01:09:21.350" style="s2"> Manage these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.800" end="01:09:22.775" style="s2"> There is a lot of work to be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.775" end="01:09:25.350" style="s2"> It took a whole week</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.625" end="01:09:29.650" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God told him to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.725" end="01:09:31.050" style="s2"> &quot;The fruits of all the trees in the garden</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.250" end="01:09:32.575" style="s2"> &quot;You can eat whatever you want&quot; (Gen 2:16)</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.475" end="01:09:35.200" style="s2"> &quot;Just the fruit on the tree of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.550" end="01:09:36.675" style="s2"> &quot;You must not eat</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.875" end="01:09:40.525" style="s2"> &quot;Because you must die the day you eat&quot; (Gen 2:17)</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.550" end="01:09:43.300" style="s2"> There are a bunch of problems here</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.650" end="01:09:47.825" style="s2"> People have been confused about this for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.200" end="01:09:51.450" style="s2"> God is a weird character in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.475" end="01:09:53.575" style="s2"> If we can&#39;t eat this</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.575" end="01:09:55.175" style="s2"> Why did you put it in the garden at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.225" end="01:09:56.450" style="s2"> This will be a problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.000" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2"> You created us and you told us not to eat it</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.050" end="01:10:00.850" style="s2"> Obviously very clear</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.875" end="01:10:02.650" style="s2"> The first thing we will do is eat it</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.650" end="01:10:05.250" style="s2"> Because people are so natural</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.250" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2"> If you tell these</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:09.025" style="s2"> People with insatiable curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.550" end="01:10:11.475" style="s2"> Said &quot;It&#39;s all good here</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.475" end="01:10:13.500" style="s2"> &quot;And there is a place you can never see&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.525" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2"> Then you leave here</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:17.050" style="s2"> And everyone was there trying to figure out what it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.200" end="01:10:18.575" style="s2"> In a blink of an eye, right</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.825" end="01:10:21.700" style="s2"> We are very curious creatures</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.225" end="01:10:24.825" style="s2"> So you want to know what God’s intention is here</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.075" end="01:10:26.800" style="s2"> There is a Gnostic conjecture</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.250" end="01:10:28.775" style="s2"> The first god</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.775" end="01:10:30.100" style="s2"> Not a good god</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.125" end="01:10:32.275" style="s2"> He is a somewhat unconscious evil god</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.725" end="01:10:34.775" style="s2"> He hopes his creation has no consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.150" end="01:10:37.150" style="s2"> So as to prevent them from developing awareness</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.150" end="01:10:39.400" style="s2"> And here again a higher-level god appeared</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.400" end="01:10:40.675" style="s2"> He may be in the image of a poisonous snake</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.675" end="01:10:42.975" style="s2"> The god who lures people to consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.325" end="01:10:46.975" style="s2"> This concept was eliminated by classical Christianity very early</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.975" end="01:10:48.925" style="s2"> Although it has some interesting things</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.125" end="01:10:50.450" style="s2"> And it takes various forms</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.650" end="01:10:53.225" style="s2"> Remnants left in the story</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.650" end="01:10:56.525" style="s2"> For example, think &quot;fallen&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.250" end="01:10:59.050" style="s2"> Is a completely tragic point of view</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.400" end="01:11:00.500" style="s2"> But on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.850" end="01:11:03.300" style="s2"> It is a prerequisite for the greatest event in history</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.300" end="01:11:05.150" style="s2"> Which is the birth of Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.175" end="01:11:06.425" style="s2"> Salvation with mankind</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.425" end="01:11:07.025" style="s2"> so</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.925" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2"> Put it this way, it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:11.225" style="s2"> Only God knows what he is going to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.225" end="01:11:15.250" style="s2"> This is a good example of that ambivalence</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.525" end="01:11:16.350" style="s2"> to me</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.425" end="01:11:19.950" style="s2"> This again shows how smart the people who integrate these stories are</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.075" end="01:11:22.075" style="s2"> I still think this is almost a miracle</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.075" end="01:11:22.850" style="s2"> Because you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.875" end="01:11:24.500" style="s2"> If you are just a promoter</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.375" end="01:11:27.450" style="s2"> You won&#39;t keep such complicated things in the text</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.850" end="01:11:29.075" style="s2"> You will just lose it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.150" end="01:11:30.375" style="s2"> Because if you are a promoter</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.375" end="01:11:33.375" style="s2"> Everything should make sense on the ideological level</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.600" end="01:11:34.975" style="s2"> God should be good here</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.075" end="01:11:37.000" style="s2"> So we better delete this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.150" end="01:11:38.825" style="s2"> Because something goes in and out of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.825" end="01:11:40.175" style="s2"> And it&#39;s not obvious what it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.175" end="01:11:41.250" style="s2"> But people didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.250" end="01:11:44.250" style="s2"> To me it shows that people are doing two things</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.275" end="01:11:47.775" style="s2"> That they try to</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.575" end="01:11:51.000" style="s2"> Not careless</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.300" end="01:11:54.650" style="s2"> They are risking contact with them</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.650" end="01:11:55.725" style="s2"> And they are very careful about tradition</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.850" end="01:11:58.250" style="s2"> And trying to figure out what happened</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.550" end="01:11:59.825" style="s2"> Because otherwise, why should I record these?</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.850" end="01:12:00.950" style="s2"> Why not simplify them</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.975" end="01:12:02.600" style="s2"> Or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.600" end="01:12:03.875" style="s2"> Attribute these simply to the devil</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.875" end="01:12:05.225" style="s2"> It’s better than letting God do these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.225" end="01:12:06.175" style="s2"> Much simpler</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.025" end="01:12:09.075" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God says</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.425" end="01:12:10.875" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not good for that person to live alone</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.975" end="01:12:19.300" style="s2"> &quot;Look at his name</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.975" end="01:12:36.125" style="s2"> Here are a few things to guess</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.500" end="01:12:38.775" style="s2"> First why does God care</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:40.000" style="s2"> What did Adam call these animals</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.750" end="01:12:43.500" style="s2"> Again the answer seems</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.500" end="01:12:44.575" style="s2"> Is related to the magic of words</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.075" end="01:12:47.725" style="s2"> According to the story we know</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.750" end="01:12:48.850" style="s2"> Humans have</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.200" end="01:12:50.500" style="s2"> Was created in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.525" end="01:12:52.175" style="s2"> And God uses language</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.200" end="01:12:53.600" style="s2"> To summon order from chaos</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.625" end="01:12:56.175" style="s2"> Human beings were created in that image</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.375" end="01:12:57.925" style="s2"> So there is a resonance here</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.925" end="01:12:59.450" style="s2"> Although it comes from an independent tradition</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.450" end="01:13:00.700" style="s2"> This resonance is</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.725" end="01:13:02.475" style="s2"> Things are not real enough before you name it</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.325" end="01:13:05.400" style="s2"> This is an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.400" end="01:13:08.550" style="s2"> And we don’t know exactly where this will extend</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.675" end="01:13:09.775" style="s2"> The usual situation is</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.100" end="01:13:15.750" style="s2"> Things often exist in a peculiar underlying form</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.750" end="01:13:16.650" style="s2"> Form of internal connection</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.650" end="01:13:19.200" style="s2"> Everything in it is very confusing</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.525" end="01:13:21.375" style="s2"> Until you point it out and name it</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.850" end="01:13:24.500" style="s2"> What exactly happened when you named it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.050" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2"> It opened itself up from the potential chaos</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.600" end="01:13:29.450" style="s2"> And turn yourself into</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.650" end="01:13:32.425" style="s2"> Tangible entities you can oppose</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:33.725" style="s2"> Of course you might say</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.725" end="01:13:35.175" style="s2"> It&#39;s real before you name it</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.750" end="01:13:39.900" style="s2"> &quot;It was real before you named it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.900" end="01:13:41.425" style="s2"> And &quot;things exist before no one observes&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.425" end="01:13:43.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.950" end="01:13:46.575" style="s2"> When you are not observing things</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.000" end="01:13:48.150" style="s2"> It is not clear whether things exist</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.275" end="01:13:50.450" style="s2"> I want to tell you about the weird side of perception</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.450" end="01:13:52.150" style="s2"> You can find it here in John Wheeler</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.175" end="01:13:53.325" style="s2"> John Wheeler is a physicist</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.375" end="01:13:54.775" style="s2"> The cool thing is</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.950" end="01:13:56.850" style="s2"> If you go out at night</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.850" end="01:13:58.500" style="s2"> Then I looked up and saw the stars</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.200" end="01:14:02.375" style="s2"> The photons from this star reach your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.250" end="01:14:06.600" style="s2"> This photon may have been roaming for 30 million years</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.250" end="01:14:08.075" style="s2"> Do you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.575" end="01:14:10.725" style="s2"> This photon from that star</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.725" end="01:14:12.275" style="s2"> If your eyes don’t receive it here and now</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.300" end="01:14:15.200" style="s2"> May not be sent</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.975" end="01:14:17.625" style="s2"> You might think how is this possible</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.625" end="01:14:18.875" style="s2"> Because this happened 20 million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.425" end="01:14:21.475" style="s2"> Actually I don’t know how this is possible</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.825" end="01:14:23.100" style="s2"> But I know John Wheeler</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.100" end="01:14:25.175" style="s2"> Do a lot of work to describe in detail</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.175" end="01:14:27.575" style="s2"> Why this is necessarily true</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.975" end="01:14:30.050" style="s2"> Wheeler still developed</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.225" end="01:14:32.250" style="s2"> Physicist with the concept of &quot;Everything comes from bits&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.575" end="01:14:33.775" style="s2"> He believes</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.200" end="01:14:38.575" style="s2"> Potential part of the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.575" end="01:14:40.375" style="s2"> Best to be analyzed as a place for potential information</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.525" end="01:14:47.025" style="s2"> The role of consciousness is to transform potential information into</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.150" end="01:14:48.475" style="s2"> Something similar to concrete reality</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.725" end="01:14:50.425" style="s2"> He is not just making an analogy</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.650" end="01:14:53.075" style="s2"> One of the basis given by him</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.100" end="01:14:54.350" style="s2"> The story I told you just now</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.350" end="01:14:56.775" style="s2"> If the photon doesn’t have a destination</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.925" end="01:14:58.700" style="s2"> It is impossible to leave where it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.500" end="01:15:02.275" style="s2"> This is complicated and puzzling</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.300" end="01:15:05.050" style="s2"> Because from the perspective of a beam of light originating from photons</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.100" end="01:15:06.025" style="s2"> There is no time</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.025" end="01:15:07.775" style="s2"> There is no distance from one place to another</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.575" end="01:15:10.800" style="s2"> Of course this seems completely incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.100" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2"> But from the perspective of a photon</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:14.275" style="s2"> The universe is completely flat</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.450" end="01:15:17.275" style="s2"> Perpendicular to the direction of photon travel</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.500" end="01:15:19.375" style="s2"> It exists everywhere at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.900" end="01:15:20.850" style="s2"> Not for us</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.850" end="01:15:22.200" style="s2"> It was 20 million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.475" end="01:15:24.325" style="s2"> But for photon, it is everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.575" end="01:15:28.075" style="s2"> Anyway, the reason I tell you this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.225" end="01:15:30.775" style="s2"> The relationship between consciousness and reality</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.775" end="01:15:32.375" style="s2"> Definitely not clear</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.600" end="01:15:34.825" style="s2"> It&#39;s not clear at all</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.175" end="01:15:37.650" style="s2"> Physicists also argue</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:40.900" style="s2"> The relationship between consciousness and reality</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.925" end="01:15:42.200" style="s2"> They also argue</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.500" end="01:15:45.050" style="s2"> What does the phenomenon I just described mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.075" end="01:15:47.350" style="s2"> I really don&#39;t have the right to join this argument</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.375" end="01:15:48.375" style="s2"> Because i am not a physicist</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.650" end="01:15:50.875" style="s2"> But I read quite Wheeler’s philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.900" end="01:15:52.475" style="s2"> As far as I can understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.725" end="01:15:55.150" style="s2"> I also at least understand that this is what he claims</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.550" end="01:16:00.125" style="s2"> I also know that this assertion is capable of understanding Wheeler’s</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.125" end="01:16:03.575" style="s2"> Physicists are taken seriously</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:05.750" style="s2"> This is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.875" end="01:16:07.775" style="s2"> Anyway, there is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.800" end="01:16:10.600" style="s2"> Emphasis on the importance of making things real</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.850" end="01:16:13.600" style="s2"> You know sometimes people don’t name things</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.600" end="01:16:15.425" style="s2"> Just for them not to become reality</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.300" end="01:16:18.650" style="s2"> If you have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.700" end="01:16:19.750" style="s2"> Obviously you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.750" end="01:16:20.650" style="s2"> It will have problems</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.675" end="01:16:21.850" style="s2"> Obviously it will</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.075" end="01:16:22.875" style="s2"> You actually know</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.875" end="01:16:25.000" style="s2"> Many times there are things that nobody wants to name</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.000" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2"> Is hidden</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.175" end="01:16:27.300" style="s2"> Everyone is thinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.325" end="01:16:29.125" style="s2"> As long as we don’t give it a name, it’s not there</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.350" end="01:16:31.100" style="s2"> To some extent it is indeed not there</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.125" end="01:16:32.775" style="s2"> Because you can pretend it&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:34.550" style="s2"> Then get away with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.550" end="01:16:35.700" style="s2"> At least in the short term</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.725" end="01:16:36.975" style="s2"> But once you give it a name</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.975" end="01:16:39.850" style="s2"> You gave it the form and no one can ignore it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.100" end="01:16:42.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s irritating because then you have to deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.350" end="01:16:44.275" style="s2"> Or face the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.900" end="01:16:46.450" style="s2"> The reason I tell you this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.475" end="01:16:49.825" style="s2"> We have an intuition</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.950" end="01:16:52.575" style="s2"> Can make things non-existent by not naming things</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.025" end="01:16:56.150" style="s2"> You name it and it appears very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.400" end="01:16:59.425" style="s2"> This is not to say that naming is the only thing that makes it a reality</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.450" end="01:17:02.225" style="s2"> But it sharpens things and brings it into focus</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.225" end="01:17:05.550" style="s2"> And gave it boundaries and scope</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.825" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2"> Whatever God wants to say to Adam</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:09.675" style="s2"> Have enough interest</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.675" end="01:17:11.525" style="s2"> He asked Adam to name all the animals</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.525" end="01:17:13.325" style="s2"> This makes them into animals to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.425" end="01:17:16.450" style="s2"> There is more important than this for this language story</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.075" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2"> Roger Brown</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:21.800" style="s2"> Studied this interesting phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.150" end="01:17:26.000" style="s2"> It is related to the relationship between perception and action</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.275" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2"> Do you know how the child treats</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.375" end="01:17:29.675" style="s2"> Is a specific animal called a cat</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.150" end="01:17:33.100" style="s2"> The word cat is as short as the word dog</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.525" end="01:17:40.375" style="s2"> We can think of cats as multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.500" end="01:17:41.525" style="s2"> Because we can see the cells</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.550" end="01:17:43.950" style="s2"> We can see the molecules we can see the atoms</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.700" end="01:17:47.450" style="s2"> We can also see the ecosystem that cats belong to</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.850" end="01:17:52.700" style="s2"> Or broader classification of mammals it belongs to</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.850" end="01:17:55.200" style="s2"> We can think of it as a unit of perception</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.525" end="01:17:56.225" style="s2"> But we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.475" end="01:17:58.525" style="s2"> We observe things at the level of cats</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.575" end="01:18:01.525" style="s2"> You can tell what people can perceive naturally</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.950" end="01:18:03.825" style="s2"> Perceptual level</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.125" end="01:18:06.350" style="s2"> By the way this anyway</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.350" end="01:18:07.775" style="s2"> It&#39;s not determined by social culture</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.975" end="01:18:09.475" style="s2"> Because these words are usually short</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.800" end="01:18:11.775" style="s2"> Easy to remember and learned very early</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.050" end="01:18:14.700" style="s2"> Analysis on this level</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.500" end="01:18:17.425" style="s2"> It exists in this world</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.425" end="01:18:18.750" style="s2"> In every possible level of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.150" end="01:18:22.225" style="s2"> We perceive it with a specific level of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.225" end="01:18:24.075" style="s2"> And the analysis at this level seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.075" end="01:18:27.575" style="s2"> At that level, the world is related to our functional utility</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.975" end="01:18:29.675" style="s2"> Perception at that level</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.700" end="01:18:30.800" style="s2"> And the naming of that level</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.250" end="01:18:33.375" style="s2"> Make things at that level a reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.775" end="01:18:36.200" style="s2"> The characteristics of things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.225" end="01:18:38.525" style="s2"> They are not easily separated from other things</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.575" end="01:18:41.000" style="s2"> They are entangled in all sorts of strange ways</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.250" end="01:18:46.100" style="s2"> But when we cast our eyes and use language</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.250" end="01:18:47.725" style="s2"> To point one&#39;s direction in the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.875" end="01:18:49.900" style="s2"> We divide things into what we can use</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.150" end="01:18:52.825" style="s2"> Distinguishable things</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.850" end="01:18:53.925" style="s2"> Something about this</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.275" end="01:18:55.825" style="s2"> Somehow make them</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.825" end="01:18:59.125" style="s2"> Than they were before</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.125" end="01:19:00.525" style="s2"> The potential to connect with each other is more real</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.150" end="01:19:03.425" style="s2"> At least this is not the same type of reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.450" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2"> I think even more untrue</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.825" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2"> I think this is the right way to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.575" end="01:19:08.125" style="s2"> Even if it is not completely untrue</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.275" end="01:19:10.275" style="s2"> It is a resonance</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.625" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2"> Adam is a little god at this moment</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.550" end="01:19:13.850" style="s2"> Little God Little Father</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.050" end="01:19:15.350" style="s2"> And God has done the basic work well</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.350" end="01:19:16.875" style="s2"> But Adam needs to show up and say</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.875" end="01:19:17.900" style="s2"> This is a cat</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.900" end="01:19:20.700" style="s2"> No matter what it is now it is a cat</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.700" end="01:19:22.425" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a dog, that&#39;s a sheep</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.375" end="01:19:26.650" style="s2"> This gives them something similar to actual form</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.550" end="01:19:30.675" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s just that the man didn&#39;t meet his spouse to help him&quot; (Genesis 2:20)</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.700" end="01:19:35.775" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God made him fall asleep and he fell asleep</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.100" end="01:19:37.425" style="s2"> &quot;So he took off one of his ribs</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.425" end="01:19:39.250" style="s2"> &quot;Put the flesh together again&quot; (Gen 2:21)</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.250" end="01:19:41.450" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God used the ribs taken from the man</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.725" end="01:19:43.500" style="s2"> &quot;Cause a woman to lead her to that man&quot; (Gen 2:22)</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.950" end="01:19:46.875" style="s2"> &quot;The man said, &quot;This is the flesh of my bones</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.275" end="01:19:48.425" style="s2"> &quot;『You can call her a woman</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.450" end="01:19:49.775" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Because she was taken out of a man&#39;&quot; (Gen 2:23)</p>

<p begin="01:19:55.950" end="01:19:59.025" style="s2"> The last three sentences have a powerful expression</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.500" end="01:20:01.775" style="s2"> The word &quot;therefore&quot; seems surprising</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.825" end="01:20:03.225" style="s2"> But here is a command</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.450" end="01:20:05.075" style="s2"> This is a good command</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.400" end="01:20:07.475" style="s2"> Because people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.900" end="01:20:09.450" style="s2"> Will spend a very painful time in marriage</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.900" end="01:20:11.850" style="s2"> If you are married or plan to get married</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.850" end="01:20:13.250" style="s2"> Then you should know this</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.825" end="01:20:20.275" style="s2"> We tend to fall to our parents for many reasons</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.500" end="01:20:22.725" style="s2"> The command here is</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.000" end="01:20:25.575" style="s2"> Once you get married, other things are second-rate</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.825" end="01:20:29.700" style="s2"> And failing to do this order will make your marriage fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.325" end="01:20:33.100" style="s2"> And to me it collapsed, you deserve it</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.100" end="01:20:35.875" style="s2"> Because it reflects your pathological immaturity</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.200" end="01:20:37.900" style="s2"> And you are</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.925" end="01:20:40.550" style="s2"> Unwillingness to escape from parental control</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.550" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2"> These parents are too in a position of interference</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.100" end="01:20:43.925" style="s2"> But this command</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.925" end="01:20:45.400" style="s2"> There is a very profound command</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.675" end="01:20:47.000" style="s2"> It&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.350" end="01:20:52.172" style="s2"> There is a view that Adam was not originally a man</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.286" end="01:20:54.353" style="s2"> Not a single man</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.700" end="01:20:56.525" style="s2"> He is more like an androgynous being</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.800" end="01:20:58.325" style="s2"> In this hermaphrodite being</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.325" end="01:21:00.700" style="s2"> There are species divided into males and females</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.025" end="01:21:03.525" style="s2"> Undifferentiated perfection</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.700" end="01:21:07.275" style="s2"> Part of humanity’s goal is to reunite the two</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.500" end="01:21:11.450" style="s2"> Restore the original perfect individual</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.825" end="01:21:14.625" style="s2"> This is actually the spiritual goal of marriage</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.775" end="01:21:16.325" style="s2"> You can read something from Jung</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.350" end="01:21:17.775" style="s2"> Jung wrote a lot about this point of view</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.800" end="01:21:19.525" style="s2"> What a great point of view</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.425" end="01:21:23.500" style="s2"> I have a couple who went to Sweden to get married</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.725" end="01:21:25.375" style="s2"> They are from North Alberta</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.400" end="01:21:28.400" style="s2"> But they inherited the Swedish tradition</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.975" end="01:21:32.425" style="s2"> They did a cool thing at the wedding</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.425" end="01:21:33.975" style="s2"> Just when they are about to get married</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.275" end="01:21:35.975" style="s2"> They put a candle between each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.675" end="01:21:37.875" style="s2"> When they got married</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.875" end="01:21:39.925" style="s2"> You would think what a candle is</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.000" end="01:21:42.050" style="s2"> It is the source of light</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.400" end="01:21:43.350" style="s2"> It is the source of lighting</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.400" end="01:21:45.300" style="s2"> It is the source of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.625" end="01:21:48.350" style="s2"> It is the candle you put on the Christmas tree in Europe</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.000" end="01:21:51.475" style="s2"> It is the light that emerges from the darkness in the cold winter</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.950" end="01:21:53.975" style="s2"> It is a sign of life in the dark</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.425" end="01:21:58.850" style="s2"> It is the reappearance of the sun at the darkest and coldest time of the year</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.850" end="01:22:01.375" style="s2"> This is also symbolic for various complicated reasons</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.375" end="01:22:04.350" style="s2"> Related to the birth of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.725" end="01:22:05.925" style="s2"> So candles are all this</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.350" end="01:22:08.600" style="s2"> The next question is why do you hold it over the top</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.350" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2"> Because what is higher than you is what is lower than you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.250" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2"> It symbolizes something transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.750" end="01:22:16.200" style="s2"> For example, why do you hold it tightly together</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.625" end="01:22:19.875" style="s2"> Because you should all hold onto the light tightly, right</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.150" end="01:22:22.500" style="s2"> You should obey the light</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.900" end="01:22:25.075" style="s2"> You will ask who is leading the marriage</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.425" end="01:22:26.200" style="s2"> Is light</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.775" end="01:22:27.775" style="s2"> That&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.775" end="01:22:29.250" style="s2"> You become one together</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.250" end="01:22:30.675" style="s2"> You are no longer both</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.925" end="01:22:33.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s not about what is good for you or your wife</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.775" end="01:22:35.425" style="s2"> This is good for marriage</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.425" end="01:22:37.900" style="s2"> Marriage-related beings</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.900" end="01:22:39.775" style="s2"> At the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.975" end="01:22:44.925" style="s2"> Reorganization of the presence of hermaphrodite</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.575" end="01:22:46.400" style="s2"> That&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.700" end="01:22:49.250" style="s2"> And all meanings are included in four sentences</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.725" end="01:22:52.975" style="s2"> All sentences are</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.000" end="01:22:55.900" style="s2"> Associated with a lot of historical interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.900" end="01:22:59.075" style="s2"> It&#39;s endless and it&#39;s just some of them</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.300" end="01:23:04.050" style="s2"> It also corrected since the woman was taken from the man</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.050" end="01:23:06.900" style="s2"> This is also the opposite of the biological process</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.275" end="01:23:09.675" style="s2"> And subordinate women to men</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.675" end="01:23:11.375" style="s2"> This is not the meaning of this passage</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.400" end="01:23:13.750" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think this is the meaning of this passage at all</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.300" end="01:23:16.500" style="s2"> There are other links in this passage</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.500" end="01:23:17.600" style="s2"> There is a view that</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.475" end="01:23:25.800" style="s2"> The princess sleeps in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.350" end="01:23:28.225" style="s2"> And the reason she fell asleep was</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.400" end="01:23:29.950" style="s2"> You must remember what happened</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.750" end="01:23:32.375" style="s2"> She has a pair of older parents</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.675" end="01:23:34.100" style="s2"> Anxious for a child</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.400" end="01:23:36.000" style="s2"> Like many people now</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.325" end="01:23:37.325" style="s2"> They only have one child</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:38.950" style="s2"> Like many people now</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.425" end="01:23:41.675" style="s2"> They don’t want anything bad to happen to their children</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.100" end="01:23:43.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s like this is a miracle</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.900" end="01:23:45.075" style="s2"> And only one</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.100" end="01:23:47.475" style="s2"> And she is a princess</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.475" end="01:23:50.100" style="s2"> So we don&#39;t let anything approach her</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.225" end="01:23:51.725" style="s2"> They held a baptism ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.000" end="01:23:52.950" style="s2"> They invited everyone</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.750" end="01:23:55.800" style="s2"> But they did not invite Mel Fiscent</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.575" end="01:23:58.375" style="s2"> Melficent is the mother of fear</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.375" end="01:23:59.125" style="s2"> She is nature itself</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.650" end="01:24:01.750" style="s2"> She is something that suddenly entered the night</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.750" end="01:24:04.250" style="s2"> In other words, she is the devil himself</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.550" end="01:24:06.975" style="s2"> She is everything you don&#39;t want your child to meet</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.225" end="01:24:08.175" style="s2"> So the king and queen said</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:10.075" style="s2"> Then let&#39;s not invite her to the baptism ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.075" end="01:24:11.675" style="s2"> Want to be beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.225" end="01:24:13.500" style="s2"> This is an Oedipus story, right</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.500" end="01:24:15.100" style="s2"> Oedipus’ mother is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.125" end="01:24:19.225" style="s2"> Ruined their mother by overprotecting her children</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.650" end="01:24:21.725" style="s2"> So instead of the children</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.725" end="01:24:23.550" style="s2"> Become stronger by touching this world</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.150" end="01:24:26.150" style="s2"> Was weakened by excessive protection</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.175" end="01:24:27.675" style="s2"> In this way, when they are put into the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.825" end="01:24:28.700" style="s2"> They cannot survive</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.700" end="01:24:31.225" style="s2"> This is the story of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.250" end="01:24:32.650" style="s2"> This is what the king and queen did</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.925" end="01:24:36.675" style="s2"> They apologized to Melficent when she showed up</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.200" end="01:24:39.525" style="s2"> They have a bunch of stupid</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.525" end="01:24:41.250" style="s2"> Why didn’t you ask her an excuse &quot;We forgot&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.675" end="01:24:45.475" style="s2"> I don’t think you will forget this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.850" end="01:24:47.350" style="s2"> And she seems to have explained</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.750" end="01:24:49.400" style="s2"> The horror of life</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.800" end="01:24:51.550" style="s2"> You can’t forget it when you have a child</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.250" end="01:24:53.850" style="s2"> You might want it to be controlled</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.850" end="01:24:54.950" style="s2"> But you won&#39;t forget it</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.175" end="01:24:57.175" style="s2"> The key is whether you invite it to the party</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.400" end="01:24:59.450" style="s2"> The answer is that it all depends on</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.475" end="01:25:01.425" style="s2"> How ignorant you want your child to become</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.975" end="01:25:03.975" style="s2"> If you want your child to be ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.975" end="01:25:06.450" style="s2"> Then you get the added benefit that they won’t leave home</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.800" end="01:25:09.525" style="s2"> You can use them for the rest of your tragic life</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.525" end="01:25:11.925" style="s2"> Instead of leaving them to find something to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.775" end="01:25:16.475" style="s2"> Of course you can retaliate against them</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.475" end="01:25:18.300" style="s2"> Whenever they have a little bit of you 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.300" end="01:25:20.150" style="s2"> The impulse to pursue courage</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.175" end="01:25:21.175" style="s2"> And as soon as you see it develop in your child</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.175" end="01:25:23.050" style="s2"> Just want to destroy it</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.250" end="01:25:25.050" style="s2"> This is another interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.650" end="01:25:27.575" style="s2"> This is the story in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.100" end="01:25:29.875" style="s2"> These are all unpleasant</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.900" end="01:25:31.800" style="s2"> Everything that happened in the story is unpleasant</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.200" end="01:25:33.775" style="s2"> Sleeping Beauty is terribly naive</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.775" end="01:25:34.875" style="s2"> Her parents settled her in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.875" end="01:25:38.000" style="s2"> Let the three have no real ability and strength</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.000" end="01:25:41.850" style="s2"> The hypocritical good old fairy raised her</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.100" end="01:25:44.000" style="s2"> They are harmless</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.400" end="01:25:46.625" style="s2"> Then she and the first idiot prince who passed by</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.625" end="01:25:47.950" style="s2"> Too deep in love</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.950" end="01:25:49.775" style="s2"> So that when he rode away</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.800" end="01:25:51.275" style="s2"> She has post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.525" end="01:25:53.525" style="s2"> That&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.075" end="01:25:57.275" style="s2"> Then she walked into the castle extremely excited</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.275" end="01:25:58.750" style="s2"> Because she and her love in this life</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.775" end="01:26:00.675" style="s2"> See you for about five minutes, my God</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.925" end="01:26:02.850" style="s2"> This is the spinning wheel</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.850" end="01:26:04.500" style="s2"> Which is when the wheel of fortune appears</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.500" end="01:26:05.500" style="s2"> Stabbed her finger</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.650" end="01:26:10.675" style="s2"> They tried to get rid of the wheel of fortune and their spikes</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.950" end="01:26:12.850" style="s2"> But she found it and poked her finger</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.875" end="01:26:14.950" style="s2"> Fell down unconsciously</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.225" end="01:26:17.850" style="s2"> But she hopes that she is not surprised at all</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.125" end="01:26:19.475" style="s2"> She was protected all her life</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.875" end="01:26:20.800" style="s2"> And very naive</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.825" end="01:26:22.650" style="s2"> So that her first love relationship was almost fatal</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.950" end="01:26:24.700" style="s2"> She hopes to sleep and never wake up</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.025" end="01:26:26.350" style="s2"> This is exactly what actually happened</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.800" end="01:26:29.225" style="s2"> So she had to wait for the prince to save her</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.525" end="01:26:31.775" style="s2"> How sexist do you think this story is</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.150" end="01:26:34.450" style="s2"> Seriously because this is the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.450" end="01:26:36.775" style="s2"> Will interpret it</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.800" end="01:26:39.075" style="s2"> She doesn&#39;t need a prince to save her</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.250" end="01:26:40.725" style="s2"> This is why Disney filmed &quot;Frozen&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.750" end="01:26:42.950" style="s2"> This movie is really shocking trash</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.850" end="01:26:55.500" style="s2"> You can say that the princess does not need the prince to save</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.775" end="01:26:58.525" style="s2"> But this is a stupid way of looking at the story</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.525" end="01:27:01.825" style="s2"> Because the prince is not just a man who goes to save a woman</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.875" end="01:27:03.550" style="s2"> Believe me he has his own problems</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.575" end="01:27:05.650" style="s2"> There is a whole dragon that needs him to fight</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.425" end="01:27:10.825" style="s2"> The prince also represents women&#39;s own consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.975" end="01:27:15.400" style="s2"> Consciousness is often expressed as a masculine symbol in stories</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.400" end="01:27:16.975" style="s2"> Logos’s point of view is the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.975" end="01:27:17.875" style="s2"> This view refers to</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.025" end="01:27:22.050" style="s2"> There is no forward brave consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:25.300" style="s2"> Women themselves fall into unconsciousness and fear</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.650" end="01:27:27.125" style="s2"> You can understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.400" end="01:27:30.200" style="s2"> A sleeping woman needs a man to wake up</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.200" end="01:27:32.750" style="s2"> Of course just as men need women to wake up</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.775" end="01:27:35.550" style="s2"> This is the same as the Dragon Slaying in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.025" end="01:27:39.025" style="s2"> But it also means that if she is not conscious</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.050" end="01:27:41.150" style="s2"> She can only lie there to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.200" end="01:27:43.650" style="s2"> Like the naive and the cursed</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.950" end="01:27:45.875" style="s2"> She must wake herself</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.900" end="01:27:51.175" style="s2"> And pushed her masculine consciousness to the forefront</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.175" end="01:27:52.650" style="s2"> So that she can survive in the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.950" end="01:27:54.925" style="s2"> Obviously women are doing their best</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.275" end="01:27:57.525" style="s2"> But this story only shows part</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.875" end="01:28:00.525" style="s2"> This is also implied by the following view</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.525" end="01:28:04.275" style="s2"> Ie unless the female is separated from the male</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.300" end="01:28:07.325" style="s2"> Otherwise she is not a human, she is just a creature</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.825" end="01:28:10.725" style="s2"> This is part of the story rooted in this</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.225" end="01:28:13.250" style="s2"> So you don’t want to understand it as patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.425" end="01:28:18.375" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want to understand everything in this way</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.400" end="01:28:21.125" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to repeat</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.200" end="01:28:23.050" style="s2"> But really we can do better than this</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.575" end="01:28:25.675" style="s2"> &quot;So people have to leave their parents</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.700" end="01:28:27.900" style="s2"> &quot;Combine with your wife, and the two will become one&quot; (Gen 2:24)</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.700" end="01:28:32.325" style="s2"> Another career about marriage is worth knowing</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.350" end="01:28:35.100" style="s2"> I learned partly from Jung</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.125" end="01:28:36.500" style="s2"> What did you do when you got married</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.925" end="01:28:37.625" style="s2"> Very simple</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.675" end="01:28:41.350" style="s2"> You find someone as bad as yourself</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.200" end="01:28:44.300" style="s2"> Then torture yourself with this person</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.400" end="01:28:48.525" style="s2"> Then said we will never leave</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.100" end="01:28:50.375" style="s2"> No matter what happens</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.050" end="01:28:54.025" style="s2"> This is great because then you won&#39;t run away</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.550" end="01:28:57.075" style="s2"> The truth is if you can escape</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.075" end="01:28:58.450" style="s2"> You can&#39;t tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.100" end="01:29:01.950" style="s2"> If you tell the truth to others and they don’t run away</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.125" end="01:29:02.900" style="s2"> Then they are not listening</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.625" end="01:29:06.025" style="s2"> If there is no one by your side who can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.025" end="01:29:07.300" style="s2"> You can&#39;t tell the truth to them</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.950" end="01:29:09.675" style="s2"> This is also one of the purposes of marriage</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.675" end="01:29:12.525" style="s2"> I bet on you you bet on me</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.550" end="01:29:14.425" style="s2"> We all know this is a failed bet</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.950" end="01:29:16.400" style="s2"> But considering the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.400" end="01:29:18.875" style="s2"> We are unlikely to find better people</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.575" end="01:29:26.125" style="s2"> Two things can be drawn here</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.125" end="01:29:29.475" style="s2"> One is that people always wait to meet the right person</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.050" end="01:29:32.375" style="s2"> You can think about it so you know it</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.925" end="01:29:34.825" style="s2"> If you go to a party to find Prince Charming</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.075" end="01:29:37.025" style="s2"> And he saw you running away without screaming</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.150" end="01:29:39.825" style="s2"> This means he is not a prince charming at all</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.275" end="01:29:42.800" style="s2"> It&#39;s like an old Nietzsche joke</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.000" end="01:29:44.925" style="s2"> &quot;If someone loves you</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.925" end="01:29:46.750" style="s2"> &quot;He will immediately lose his charm in your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.450" end="01:29:50.475" style="s2"> Or Woody Allen-style jokes</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.525" end="01:29:53.100" style="s2"> &quot;I will never join a club that will allow me to join&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.825" end="01:29:58.125" style="s2"> This is something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.700" end="01:30:01.750" style="s2"> You will treat yourself to someone who is as imperfect as you</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.225" end="01:30:04.450" style="s2"> Tied together</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.775" end="01:30:11.125" style="s2"> This way you may enter a situation where you can really negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.850" end="01:30:15.075" style="s2"> You may think you have some problems</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.475" end="01:30:17.350" style="s2"> I also have some questions</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.675" end="01:30:19.575" style="s2"> Regardless of the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.600" end="01:30:20.750" style="s2"> We are all grasshoppers tied to a rope for the next 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.300" end="01:30:23.550" style="s2"> We can either solve these things</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.175" end="01:30:26.650" style="s2"> Or suffer 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.050" end="01:30:28.825" style="s2"> People belong to the kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.825" end="01:30:30.500" style="s2"> Not aware of the severity of this matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.525" end="01:30:32.525" style="s2"> Then these problems will not be solved</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.800" end="01:30:33.975" style="s2"> You don’t name those things and choose to ignore them</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.150" end="01:30:35.225" style="s2"> Because you always have a way out</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.850" end="01:30:37.800" style="s2"> Living with someone else is one thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.075" end="01:30:40.325" style="s2"> Cohabitation before marriage</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.350" end="01:30:42.100" style="s2"> More likely to divorce than vice versa</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.450" end="01:30:43.450" style="s2"> the reason is</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.525" end="01:30:46.200" style="s2"> What are your intentions when you live with someone</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.775" end="01:30:47.625" style="s2"> Just think about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.300" end="01:30:51.050" style="s2"> So far</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.550" end="01:30:55.525" style="s2"> You are the best person i can fool</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.325" end="01:31:01.075" style="s2"> But I want to reserve the right to replace you at any time</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.350" end="01:31:09.100" style="s2"> If a better person happens to hit me</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.400" end="01:31:20.325" style="s2"> How can anyone not be offended by this proposal</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.700" end="01:31:22.025" style="s2"> They will be willing to cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.025" end="01:31:23.550" style="s2"> Because they will treat you the same way</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.150" end="01:31:26.050" style="s2"> That&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.150" end="01:31:27.600" style="s2"> I know you won&#39;t promise me</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.600" end="01:31:29.150" style="s2"> It means you don&#39;t take me</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.175" end="01:31:30.900" style="s2"> Or our relationship is at the highest position</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.375" end="01:31:33.375" style="s2"> But as long as I can leave when I want</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.375" end="01:31:34.600" style="s2"> I would also play with you</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.675" end="01:31:37.075" style="s2"> This is incredible, you might think</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.125" end="01:31:39.600" style="s2"> It’s too stupid to tie yourself to someone else</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.950" end="01:31:41.875" style="s2"> Really stupid, no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.125" end="01:31:45.200" style="s2"> But it’s better than other options</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.525" end="01:31:49.950" style="s2"> There are some things you&#39;ll never learn without this restraint</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.225" end="01:31:52.600" style="s2"> Because you can avoid it, you always have a way out</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.925" end="01:31:55.025" style="s2"> If you can leave, you don&#39;t have to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.475" end="01:31:57.100" style="s2"> It&#39;s that simple, you can leave directly</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.375" end="01:31:59.300" style="s2"> So you don’t have anyone who can be honest with you</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.253" end="01:32:09.343" style="s2"> These pictures are all representations of &quot;origin&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.343" end="01:32:11.044" style="s2"> These are not all Adam</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.055" end="01:32:13.487" style="s2"> This picture is an ancient Chinese symbol</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.497" end="01:32:15.752" style="s2"> I remember it was called Fuxi and Nuwa</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.752" end="01:32:17.913" style="s2"> I think my pronunciation is not accurate enough</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.913" end="01:32:19.113" style="s2"> But it is really cool</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:20.668" style="s2"> Look at the snake below</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.002" end="01:32:23.163" style="s2"> They are a bit like DNA symbols</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.184" end="01:32:24.906" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.762" end="01:32:28.163" style="s2"> They are the embryonic form of the giant snake in the primitive universe</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.184" end="01:32:30.355" style="s2"> All potential is born from it</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.355" end="01:32:33.195" style="s2"> And there is a division between male and female</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.247" end="01:32:36.065" style="s2"> So it&#39;s like an unknown predator</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.065" end="01:32:37.422" style="s2"> This is a way to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.422" end="01:32:42.192" style="s2"> The most basic concept of mankind is the unknown predator</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.192" end="01:32:44.541" style="s2"> Then there are two</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.562" end="01:32:46.796" style="s2"> The division of basic cognitive elements</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.806" end="01:32:48.080" style="s2"> Positive and negative</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.080" end="01:32:49.656" style="s2"> You can see a similar situation in this picture</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.656" end="01:32:51.232" style="s2"> This picture is from Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.232" end="01:32:52.735" style="s2"> Also very old</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.767" end="01:32:55.731" style="s2"> This giant snake forms the basis of everything</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.028" end="01:33:00.835" style="s2"> It is divided into Isis Queen of the Underworld</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.835" end="01:33:05.387" style="s2"> King of Osiris, King of Swan, Pharaoh, King of Order</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.449" end="01:33:06.441" style="s2"> You are in ancient alchemy symbols</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.441" end="01:33:07.652" style="s2"> Can see the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.652" end="01:33:10.240" style="s2"> I like it because it looks so much like</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.240" end="01:33:12.036" style="s2"> The little things Harry Potter chased</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.046" end="01:33:14.165" style="s2"> This is not accidental</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.165" end="01:33:17.025" style="s2"> Seekers are responsible for chasing this</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.130" end="01:33:19.990" style="s2"> Win if you catch it</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.990" end="01:33:21.451" style="s2"> This is really an old idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.451" end="01:33:24.071" style="s2"> I can’t figure out how J.K. Rowling knew</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.134" end="01:33:27.328" style="s2"> Because this is a very old mysterious symbol</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.328" end="01:33:30.126" style="s2"> It is called &quot;Circular Chaos&quot; on Google</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.147" end="01:33:32.422" style="s2"> I searched for &quot;circular chaos&quot; on Google</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.422" end="01:33:34.541" style="s2"> Only relevant references can be found on my page</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.541" end="01:33:39.113" style="s2"> So I don’t know how Rowling came up with it</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.113" end="01:33:40.783" style="s2"> Although I know she has read a lot of ancient documents</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.825" end="01:33:44.301" style="s2"> &quot;If you catch this thing in the meta game,</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.301" end="01:33:45.554" style="s2"> &quot;You will win all games&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.575" end="01:33:46.451" style="s2"> The above idea is completely correct</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.451" end="01:33:49.844" style="s2"> This is what is called Quidditch&#39;s theme</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.844" end="01:33:51.744" style="s2"> This is &quot;potential&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.744" end="01:33:53.414" style="s2"> God is in this potential</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.414" end="01:33:55.355" style="s2"> Created the world at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.355" end="01:33:57.297" style="s2"> And what emerged from it was a certain</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.297" end="01:33:58.643" style="s2"> Turi, that&#39;s the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.643" end="01:33:59.781" style="s2"> Fighting another dragon</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.781" end="01:34:02.005" style="s2"> This is partly the snake in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.036" end="01:34:06.002" style="s2"> And then it also showed masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.002" end="01:34:10.293" style="s2"> Potential predator unknown positive and negative</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.293" end="01:34:14.865" style="s2"> This is like the evolution history of human cognitive consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.875" end="01:34:16.827" style="s2"> Single manifestation of</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.869" end="01:34:18.080" style="s2"> This is very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.132" end="01:34:20.220" style="s2"> And this is an ideal image</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.251" end="01:34:21.785" style="s2"> This is a union of the sun and the moon</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.785" end="01:34:24.802" style="s2"> A superbiological hermaphrodite</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.813" end="01:34:27.276" style="s2"> This is also Adam and Eve at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.307" end="01:34:29.113" style="s2"> Before the &quot;fall&quot; happened</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.144" end="01:34:30.846" style="s2"> This is also the purpose of marriage</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.005" end="01:34:32.871" style="s2"> This is a sacrament</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.892" end="01:34:34.291" style="s2"> Is shown in all these images</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.291" end="01:34:35.982" style="s2"> The wide range of images that can be included in this concept</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.982" end="01:34:37.913" style="s2"> Is totally incredible</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.969" end="01:34:42.036" style="s2"> These are some more classic forms of expression</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.036" end="01:34:44.364" style="s2"> About Eve being taken out of Adam’s body</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.132" end="01:34:49.604" style="s2"> This is a very cool sentence</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.604" end="01:34:51.149" style="s2"> &quot;At that time, the husband and wife were naked</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.149" end="01:34:52.182" style="s2"> &quot;Not ashamed&quot; (Gen 2:25)</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.142" end="01:34:57.213" style="s2"> I wrote this sentence because someone</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.213" end="01:34:58.946" style="s2"> Surprised that Adam and Eve are not ashamed</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.946" end="01:35:01.013" style="s2"> Otherwise, why would they point it out</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.013" end="01:35:03.706" style="s2"> There are two things implied here</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.706" end="01:35:08.007" style="s2"> For the first time, human beings were naked</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.007" end="01:35:09.343" style="s2"> They are not ashamed</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.343" end="01:35:11.389" style="s2"> The second period is now</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.441" end="01:35:13.643" style="s2"> Humans are ashamed when they are naked</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.852" end="01:35:17.746" style="s2"> The question is how nudity and shame are linked together</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.975" end="01:35:21.003" style="s2"> In the classic interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.023" end="01:35:24.865" style="s2"> The connotative meaning of sex often appears</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.865" end="01:35:27.944" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s related to being naked</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.944" end="01:35:30.073" style="s2"> But I don’t think it’s that simple</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.061" end="01:35:35.042" style="s2"> Right my daughter</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.679" end="01:35:36.754" style="s2"> She might be because of me in this lecture</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.754" end="01:35:38.737" style="s2"> Get angry at revealing it</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.810" end="01:35:41.691" style="s2"> When my daughter was a child</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.691" end="01:35:42.673" style="s2"> Never worry about being naked</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.694" end="01:35:44.750" style="s2"> Whether to wear clothes or not is the same to her</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.813" end="01:35:47.474" style="s2"> But when my son was three years old</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.474" end="01:35:48.936" style="s2"> But has paid great attention to privacy</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.019" end="01:35:51.274" style="s2"> The door of his bedroom is always closed</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.284" end="01:35:52.401" style="s2"> Same for bathroom</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.422" end="01:35:53.643" style="s2"> It’s like saying &quot;Get out&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.654" end="01:35:56.023" style="s2"> These things seem to happen autonomously</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.023" end="01:35:57.099" style="s2"> We have two children</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.099" end="01:35:59.030" style="s2"> One is very privacy-conscious and the other is not</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.030" end="01:35:59.426" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.426" end="01:36:00.679" style="s2"> The occurrence of this situation has a lot to do with us</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.679" end="01:36:03.320" style="s2"> It’s a magical process for my son to become self-aware</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.291" end="01:36:07.822" style="s2"> This kind of self-consciousness does appear in</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.829" end="01:36:09.562" style="s2"> In children around three years old</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.562" end="01:36:11.973" style="s2"> We usually think at this time</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.973" end="01:36:14.353" style="s2"> Maybe let the kids play around naked on the beach</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.353" end="01:36:15.877" style="s2"> Not a very good idea</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.975" end="01:36:20.084" style="s2"> In some cases children are naked in public</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.094" end="01:36:22.088" style="s2"> Usually no problem</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.088" end="01:36:25.773" style="s2"> We would consider it acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.378" end="01:36:27.881" style="s2"> Why i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.184" end="01:36:29.886" style="s2"> Why is nudity gradually becoming unacceptable</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.906" end="01:36:32.631" style="s2"> Obviously it has to do with sex</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.641" end="01:36:34.343" style="s2"> But this is a very complicated phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.343" end="01:36:38.456" style="s2"> Nudity is a very complicated thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.456" end="01:36:40.512" style="s2"> First of all, humans are a bit strange</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.522" end="01:36:43.080" style="s2"> Because compared to most animals</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.080" end="01:36:44.917" style="s2"> We have very little body hair</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.167" end="01:36:47.172" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.172" end="01:36:49.259" style="s2"> Some people think that when humans first wandered in Africa</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.259" end="01:36:52.276" style="s2"> Lost hair</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.328" end="01:36:53.758" style="s2"> Humans are really good at running</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.769" end="01:36:55.209" style="s2"> We can chase animals until they fall</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.220" end="01:36:57.349" style="s2"> A good-sized human</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.370" end="01:36:58.831" style="s2"> Can run a horse to death in a week</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.207" end="01:37:00.648" style="s2"> We really can run</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.648" end="01:37:02.172" style="s2"> There are many of our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.172" end="01:37:04.019" style="s2"> For example, the Kalahari bushmen are still doing this</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.061" end="01:37:07.537" style="s2"> They will chase animals until they are exhausted</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.735" end="01:37:09.322" style="s2"> But these bushmen are safe and sound</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.332" end="01:37:11.827" style="s2"> They sometimes use poisonous arrows to kill animals</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.827" end="01:37:13.174" style="s2"> But they can exhaust them just by chasing them</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.174" end="01:37:15.042" style="s2"> We have great endurance</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.042" end="01:37:17.474" style="s2"> If you want to run around in the desert</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.474" end="01:37:18.529" style="s2"> Then we need to be able to dissipate heat in time</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.539" end="01:37:21.337" style="s2"> So we don’t have any hair. This is an explanation</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.347" end="01:37:23.810" style="s2"> Buckminster Fowler has an interesting explanation for this</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.810" end="01:37:26.274" style="s2"> He believed that at some point in our evolution,</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.326" end="01:37:28.069" style="s2"> We have been by the water for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.069" end="01:37:30.439" style="s2"> We are like &quot;fish apes&quot; like fish apes</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.491" end="01:37:31.911" style="s2"> We like to stay on the beach</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.911" end="01:37:33.456" style="s2"> A lot of food there</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.456" end="01:37:34.207" style="s2"> We also like swimming</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.207" end="01:37:35.000" style="s2"> Us as land animals</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.000" end="01:37:35.992" style="s2"> Really good at swimming</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.170" end="01:37:38.727" style="s2"> And we are the same as some marine life</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.748" end="01:37:40.700" style="s2"> The tears you shed when you cry are salty</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.700" end="01:37:42.579" style="s2"> Women have a layer of subcutaneous fat</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.579" end="01:37:44.541" style="s2"> This is the same as some marine life</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.345" end="01:37:47.391" style="s2"> It&#39;s weird that our feet</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.401" end="01:37:49.833" style="s2"> Good at slapping in the water</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.833" end="01:37:51.566" style="s2"> Although we can also walk with them</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.577" end="01:37:52.714" style="s2"> So he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.714" end="01:37:56.984" style="s2"> Maybe this adaptation is to live in the water</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.984" end="01:37:58.195" style="s2"> Just like seals and other animals</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.195" end="01:38:00.470" style="s2"> We are kind of alive back to the ocean but not quite so</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.005" end="01:38:05.126" style="s2"> Anyway, it’s interesting to have Mao gone</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.126" end="01:38:08.132" style="s2"> It does expose us to the environment</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.132" end="01:38:10.700" style="s2"> But animals with fur are not like this</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.034" end="01:38:12.140" style="s2"> And we are upright</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.527" end="01:38:14.938" style="s2"> This is strange because most animals are not</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.938" end="01:38:15.867" style="s2"> They are all on all fours</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.929" end="01:38:17.944" style="s2"> Make their fragile parts</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.944" end="01:38:21.201" style="s2"> Are protected and not exposed to sight</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.222" end="01:38:23.174" style="s2"> Of course when you stand naked</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.261" end="01:38:30.449" style="s2"> Your physical and mental qualities are being painfully displayed</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.159" end="01:38:33.424" style="s2"> People often complain about this</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.456" end="01:38:35.397" style="s2"> If you look at the feminist strategy</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.397" end="01:38:36.598" style="s2"> For example, they make a fuss about the concept of &quot;beauty&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.598" end="01:38:41.368" style="s2"> Women suffering from eating disorders can be directly attributed to</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.368" end="01:38:43.403" style="s2"> On the cover of the magazine</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.403" end="01:38:44.656" style="s2"> Too many beauties printed</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.909" end="01:38:48.184" style="s2"> Even if the people buying these magazines are women</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.184" end="01:38:49.113" style="s2"> They are attracted by these magazines</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.124" end="01:38:50.950" style="s2"> They feel good when they buy</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.307" end="01:38:54.562" style="s2"> If the stimulus is negative</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.562" end="01:38:55.783" style="s2"> That women would avoid these magazines</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.794" end="01:38:56.587" style="s2"> Instead of buying them</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.587" end="01:38:57.464" style="s2"> So as a theory</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.464" end="01:38:58.884" style="s2"> It&#39;s very bad</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.925" end="01:39:02.558" style="s2"> But it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.923" end="01:39:05.942" style="s2"> Examples of &quot;beauty standards make people feel ashamed&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.389" end="01:39:07.986" style="s2"> Even if you are not ugly now</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.007" end="01:39:09.698" style="s2"> It will definitely become ugly at some stage in the future</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.099" end="01:39:14.061" style="s2"> This is a difficult thing to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.061" end="01:39:16.785" style="s2"> Knowing that I can be the perfect look</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.900" end="01:39:19.781" style="s2"> Even I used to be perfect</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.781" end="01:39:21.076" style="s2"> But this state will not last long</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.076" end="01:39:25.394" style="s2"> Or never become perfect is a painful thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.394" end="01:39:27.186" style="s2"> I think it is more painful for women</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.193" end="01:39:29.040" style="s2"> Because women are more often men</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.040" end="01:39:32.850" style="s2"> Comment on age and fertility</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.871" end="01:39:35.710" style="s2"> This is the result of discussion from the perspective of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.783" end="01:39:36.754" style="s2"> Men are more often women</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.765" end="01:39:38.821" style="s2"> Evaluate in terms of socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.821" end="01:39:40.209" style="s2"> Both situations are harsh</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.710" end="01:39:46.250" style="s2"> No matter how you know that you are exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.420" end="01:39:50.825" style="s2"> To all aspects of your life</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.825" end="01:39:53.925" style="s2"> Before the harshest judges</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.925" end="01:39:54.896" style="s2"> Is a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.896" end="01:39:56.942" style="s2"> And if you are not wearing clothes</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.942" end="01:39:58.341" style="s2"> This judgment will be further amplified</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.393" end="01:40:00.178" style="s2"> To a certain extent clothing plays a protective role</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.178" end="01:40:03.038" style="s2"> But the bigger role of clothing is just to prevent others</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.048" end="01:40:06.253" style="s2"> Have always been harsh on you</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.253" end="01:40:07.506" style="s2"> It can have such an impact</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.758" end="01:40:15.367" style="s2"> So this story proves</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.376" end="01:40:17.266" style="s2"> We were not like that at a certain time</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.276" end="01:40:18.497" style="s2"> Animals are not like that</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.497" end="01:40:20.220" style="s2"> So the inference that &quot;we are not like that&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.220" end="01:40:21.932" style="s2"> Seems reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.932" end="01:40:22.756" style="s2"> But in a certain period</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.756" end="01:40:23.706" style="s2"> This situation has changed</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.061" end="01:40:26.013" style="s2"> &quot;At that time, the husband and wife were naked</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.013" end="01:40:27.109" style="s2"> &quot;Not ashamed&quot; (Gen 2:25)</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.061" end="01:40:31.723" style="s2"> &quot;The Jehovah God made</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.723" end="01:40:33.257" style="s2"> &quot;Only snakes are more cunning than all the living creatures in the field</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.393" end="01:40:36.044" style="s2"> &quot;The snake said to the woman, &quot;Does God really say</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.044" end="01:40:37.182" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;You are not allowed to eat</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.182" end="01:40:38.320" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Are the fruits on all the trees in the garden?&quot; (Genesis 3:1)</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.320" end="01:40:39.113" style="s2"> I like this print</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.211" end="01:40:43.268" style="s2"> I can&#39;t remember who painted this</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.268" end="01:40:43.737" style="s2"> Who is it</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.249" end="01:40:45.231" style="s2"> Doray is right</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.231" end="01:40:45.251" style="s2"> It was Duo Lei who made the engraving illustrations for &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.251" end="01:40:48.884" style="s2"> It was Duo Lei who made the engraving illustrations for &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.904" end="01:40:50.293" style="s2"> Really beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.355" end="01:40:52.756" style="s2"> This side is Satan and this side is a snake</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.808" end="01:40:54.969" style="s2"> Of course in the &quot;Genesis&quot; story</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.969" end="01:40:57.109" style="s2"> Satan and the snake are strangely linked</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.109" end="01:41:01.441" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to clarify</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.587" end="01:41:03.372" style="s2"> In the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.372" end="01:41:04.886" style="s2"> There is no indication</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.927" end="01:41:08.748" style="s2"> The snake that tempted Eve is also Satan</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.748" end="01:41:10.512" style="s2"> Is the initiator of all evil</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.512" end="01:41:13.393" style="s2"> As for how these two stories are tangled together</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.393" end="01:41:15.543" style="s2"> I think i know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.543" end="01:41:17.151" style="s2"> I will reveal it for you tonight</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.151" end="01:41:19.176" style="s2"> But it really took me a long time to figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.197" end="01:41:21.389" style="s2"> It&#39;s really wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.389" end="01:41:23.476" style="s2"> I can&#39;t believe people figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.476" end="01:41:27.360" style="s2"> It&#39;s incredibly colorful</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.370" end="01:41:30.303" style="s2"> This is a hint to this idea, right</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.314" end="01:41:32.589" style="s2"> There is a close relationship between these two things</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.351" end="01:41:36.399" style="s2"> In short, snakes are more cunning than all creatures in the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.399" end="01:41:37.840" style="s2"> Cunning is a funny word</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.840" end="01:41:39.938" style="s2"> This is the explanation in the Oxford English Dictionary</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.938" end="01:41:42.516" style="s2"> We will enlarge the word slightly</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.516" end="01:41:44.813" style="s2"> This is exactly what you did in the analysis of Jung’s dream</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.272" end="01:41:46.973" style="s2"> You will pay attention to dreams</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.984" end="01:41:49.948" style="s2"> Implied meaning of some concepts</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.948" end="01:41:53.059" style="s2"> Cunning &quot;Describes the actions of humans or animals, etc.</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.059" end="01:41:55.470" style="s2"> &quot;Cunning, cunning, cunning, unfaithful&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.470" end="01:41:57.433" style="s2"> This is very mysterious and low-key, right</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.433" end="01:41:59.980" style="s2"> It is not easy to find</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.084" end="01:42:03.612" style="s2"> &quot;Describe the appearance or gaze is cunning, sneaky and sneaky&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.633" end="01:42:06.817" style="s2"> &quot;Describe people who are experienced to be professional and smart&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.827" end="01:42:08.967" style="s2"> &quot;Describe a piece of art, machinery, etc.</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.967" end="01:42:11.065" style="s2"> &quot;Ingenious, unique and sophisticated production or design&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.065" end="01:42:15.457" style="s2"> I think until now</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.457" end="01:42:17.401" style="s2"> These terms are derived from snake</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.412" end="01:42:19.270" style="s2"> I think they are very cool</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.312" end="01:42:20.992" style="s2"> And the physiological structure is very clever</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.992" end="01:42:22.151" style="s2"> They are eye-catching</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.151" end="01:42:23.362" style="s2"> But at the same time it’s not easy to detect</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.499" end="01:42:26.128" style="s2"> &quot;Describe one that contains</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.149" end="01:42:28.560" style="s2"> &quot;The nature of obscure distinctions or subtle ideas</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.560" end="01:42:32.172" style="s2"> &quot;Profound and hard to understand&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.019" end="01:42:42.057" style="s2"> &quot;Describe a person’s mental and intellectual activities</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.078" end="01:42:44.051" style="s2"> &quot;Characterized by wisdom and insight</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.051" end="01:42:45.742" style="s2"> &quot;He has the ability to discern and is very shrewd&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.742" end="01:42:46.399" style="s2"> This is really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.399" end="01:42:50.345" style="s2"> Because Milton’s Satan is very intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.836" end="01:42:52.662" style="s2"> And this happens often</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.662" end="01:42:55.575" style="s2"> Bad guys are often evil scientists</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.765" end="01:42:59.416" style="s2"> You see the same in the Lion King</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.583" end="01:43:00.846" style="s2"> Scar is a smart character</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.856" end="01:43:02.600" style="s2"> An arrogant and deceitful but intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.610" end="01:43:04.698" style="s2"> It&#39;s not stupid at all</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.698" end="01:43:07.735" style="s2"> It is not a wise man but it is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.756" end="01:43:09.468" style="s2"> The evil voice that always whispers in the ears of the lion king</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.541" end="01:43:12.245" style="s2"> This is related to the inner pride of the wise</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.245" end="01:43:15.115" style="s2"> Catholics have been warning mankind for centuries</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.115" end="01:43:17.714" style="s2"> Don&#39;t be proud of human wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.746" end="01:43:20.387" style="s2"> This partly caused</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.387" end="01:43:21.869" style="s2"> The split between Catholicism and science</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.869" end="01:43:23.195" style="s2"> Although if you look at the history</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.195" end="01:43:24.760" style="s2"> You will find that the Catholic idea is exaggerated</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.157" end="01:43:26.368" style="s2"> The idea is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.368" end="01:43:31.097" style="s2"> Talented people have a special ability</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.117" end="01:43:33.664" style="s2"> And it is the highest angel in the kingdom of God</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.664" end="01:43:35.366" style="s2"> This is how Milton describes it</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.387" end="01:43:38.080" style="s2"> But it can also be bad</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.854" end="01:43:43.195" style="s2"> Because intellect can be because of own existence</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.195" end="01:43:44.259" style="s2"> And achievement and become conceited</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.270" end="01:43:46.399" style="s2"> It will fall in love with its own results</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.399" end="01:43:47.350" style="s2"> When you are occupied by ideology</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.360" end="01:43:48.873" style="s2"> This happens too</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.873" end="01:43:52.735" style="s2"> Because what you end up with is the dogma created by humans</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.746" end="01:43:54.082" style="s2"> In the words of Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.113" end="01:43:55.595" style="s2"> &quot;You are completely controlled by it</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.595" end="01:43:59.083" style="s2"> &quot;You believe it is 100% correct&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.083" end="01:44:02.255" style="s2"> It ends all transcendental things</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.255" end="01:44:06.504" style="s2"> So this is an implicit factor of intellect</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.504" end="01:44:09.385" style="s2"> Symbolically linked with the snake in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.199" end="01:44:13.038" style="s2"> &quot;Describes keen insight such as sense, touch, etc.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.038" end="01:44:15.034" style="s2"> &quot;Including that you can feel subtle or subtle differences</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.188" end="01:44:18.497" style="s2"> &quot;Especially those differences that are too subtle to distinguish or analyze</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.497" end="01:44:21.149" style="s2"> &quot;Also almost imperceptible and elusive.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.295" end="01:44:24.593" style="s2"> &quot;Describe the thickness or width is very thin and thin&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.656" end="01:44:28.497" style="s2"> &quot;Subtle things and scarce things&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.497" end="01:44:29.687" style="s2"> This kind of thing hardly exists</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.408" end="01:44:32.370" style="s2"> &quot;The woman said to the snake</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.610" end="01:44:34.938" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;We can eat the fruit from the trees in the garden (Genesis 3:2)</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.938" end="01:44:37.130" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Only the fruit of the tree in the garden</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.130" end="01:44:38.602" style="s2"> &quot;『God once said</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.602" end="01:44:41.305" style="s2"> &quot;『You must not eat or touch</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.305" end="01:44:42.307" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Lest you die&quot;&quot; (Genesis 3:3)</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.307" end="01:44:46.316" style="s2"> &quot;The snake said to the woman, &quot;You don&#39;t necessarily die (Genesis 3:4)</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.326" end="01:44:48.967" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Because God knows the day you eat</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.988" end="01:44:51.608" style="s2"> &quot;『The eyes are bright</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.608" end="01:44:52.902" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;As God can know good and evil&quot; (Genesis 3:5)</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.330" end="01:44:56.378" style="s2"> Cunning, subtle, is this a good story?</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.424" end="01:45:00.679" style="s2"> In this way it immediately hints</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.836" end="01:45:02.777" style="s2"> &quot;You can&#39;t believe in God&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.975" end="01:45:04.238" style="s2"> It&#39;s cunning</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.238" end="01:45:07.683" style="s2"> Then it said &quot;and God is trying to deceive you&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.683" end="01:45:10.481" style="s2"> &quot;And God did this out of jealousy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.481" end="01:45:12.923" style="s2"> &quot;And God doesn&#39;t want you to know what he knows</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.923" end="01:45:14.165" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not good to let you know.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.197" end="01:45:15.595" style="s2"> &quot;And God is lying to you</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.595" end="01:45:17.401" style="s2"> &quot;Because you won&#39;t die anyway.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.401" end="01:45:21.305" style="s2"> &quot;If you eat it is contrary to what was warned before</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.347" end="01:45:24.218" style="s2"> &quot;Your eyes will brighten and nothing more</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.218" end="01:45:26.003" style="s2"> &quot;You will become like God, knowing good and evil.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.003" end="01:45:27.527" style="s2"> This sounds really good</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.975" end="01:45:30.742" style="s2"> And what does Eve know?</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.961" end="01:45:35.115" style="s2"> No wonder she is so easily affected by rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.115" end="01:45:36.253" style="s2"> It&#39;s also fun</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.264" end="01:45:38.184" style="s2"> Because God warned Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.184" end="01:45:39.479" style="s2"> Don&#39;t eat that damn fruit</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.479" end="01:45:41.337" style="s2"> But they never promised that they would not eat</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.714" end="01:45:44.896" style="s2"> They did not guarantee that they were just warned</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.896" end="01:45:46.472" style="s2"> Should they obey</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.472" end="01:45:48.758" style="s2"> How obedient do you want your child to be</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.758" end="01:45:50.261" style="s2"> You hope they are submissive enough</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.261" end="01:45:51.190" style="s2"> So as not to get hurt</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.190" end="01:45:52.161" style="s2"> But not obedient enough</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.161" end="01:45:53.226" style="s2"> So that they can break into the sky</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.226" end="01:45:54.708" style="s2"> Do something brave</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.708" end="01:45:55.846" style="s2"> Break some rules</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.846" end="01:45:56.869" style="s2"> Learn something</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.130" end="01:46:00.282" style="s2"> This is a very contradictory story</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.439" end="01:46:03.445" style="s2"> Anyway, the snake won this round</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.445" end="01:46:06.660" style="s2"> Eve listened to what the snake said</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.815" end="01:46:13.612" style="s2"> The same set of pictures</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.696" end="01:46:15.637" style="s2"> We have Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.731" end="01:46:18.560" style="s2"> We have this tree we have this weird snake</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.570" end="01:46:21.389" style="s2"> It appears as a dragon like a sphinx</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.451" end="01:46:23.038" style="s2"> And is associated with the tree</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.038" end="01:46:25.846" style="s2"> The snake is always associated with the tree</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.330" end="01:46:31.274" style="s2"> God knows we have done this for tens of millions of years</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.316" end="01:46:33.696" style="s2"> Arboreal primates</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.758" end="01:46:38.602" style="s2"> There are three main types of our main natural enemies</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.124" end="01:46:43.007" style="s2"> Snake, raptor, big cat</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.717" end="01:46:45.669" style="s2"> So the snake is related to the tree</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.669" end="01:46:47.255" style="s2"> It&#39;s been a long long time</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.537" end="01:46:49.385" style="s2"> The lesson the snake teaches people is</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.562" end="01:46:51.107" style="s2"> You better be alert</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.284" end="01:46:53.090" style="s2"> Otherwise the things you don&#39;t like will hurt you</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.236" end="01:46:57.360" style="s2"> So who is the easiest to follow snakes?</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.360" end="01:46:58.644" style="s2"> That will be eve</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.727" end="01:47:02.433" style="s2"> The reason is that Eve has offspring</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.433" end="01:47:06.232" style="s2"> And for snakes there is nothing more delicious than children</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.587" end="01:47:09.907" style="s2"> Eve&#39;s uneasiness and neuroticism are completely justified</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.907" end="01:47:12.318" style="s2"> They are more likely to have these qualities than men and women</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.318" end="01:47:13.706" style="s2"> And the difference is very obvious</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.769" end="01:47:15.522" style="s2"> This exists in many cultures</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.522" end="01:47:17.088" style="s2"> And first appeared in puberty</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.088" end="01:47:19.541" style="s2"> According to our current understanding</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.552" end="01:47:21.838" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that women are more vulnerable to sexual assault</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.859" end="01:47:23.226" style="s2"> Women are also smaller</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.727" end="01:47:24.865" style="s2"> In case of physical conflict</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.865" end="01:47:26.441" style="s2"> Body size to urinate can be a weakness</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.441" end="01:47:31.994" style="s2"> More importantly, why do we assume</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.046" end="01:47:33.831" style="s2"> The human female’s nervous system changes</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.831" end="01:47:36.744" style="s2"> To adapt to her health</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.827" end="01:47:38.424" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t we assume</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.424" end="01:47:39.596" style="s2"> Changes in the nervous system of human women</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.596" end="01:47:42.756" style="s2"> To adapt to the parent-child relationship between her and her child</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.132" end="01:47:45.470" style="s2"> Because if it weren&#39;t the case, the babies would die</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.627" end="01:47:46.890" style="s2"> You might think</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.890" end="01:47:48.184" style="s2"> Are more prone than men and women</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.184" end="01:47:50.063" style="s2"> Depression and anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.063" end="01:47:51.754" style="s2"> This is an unimaginable heavy burden</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.785" end="01:47:53.831" style="s2"> By the way, this also exists in a cross-cultural environment</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.831" end="01:47:55.220" style="s2"> This also appeared at the beginning of adolescence</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.397" end="01:47:57.735" style="s2"> The most noticeable difference is in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.735" end="01:47:59.573" style="s2"> Some people think that these characteristics are formed by social culture</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.583" end="01:48:00.794" style="s2"> But in fact, it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.514" end="01:48:04.771" style="s2"> But this is for a reason, also in puberty</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.771" end="01:48:08.497" style="s2"> Sexual differences between men and women began to appear</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.591" end="01:48:11.326" style="s2"> Men&#39;s upper body is more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.347" end="01:48:13.341" style="s2"> Much stronger than women</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.351" end="01:48:15.251" style="s2"> So this makes men much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.251" end="01:48:19.030" style="s2"> Human’s instinctive defense mechanism is boxing</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.030" end="01:48:20.554" style="s2"> Like a kangaroo</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.575" end="01:48:22.923" style="s2"> There are other animals that can also punch</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.944" end="01:48:24.938" style="s2"> Chimpanzees can too</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.938" end="01:48:27.631" style="s2"> But when humans strike, their power is concentrated on the upper body and shoulders</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.714" end="01:48:29.875" style="s2"> So women cannot compete with men in the battle</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.875" end="01:48:31.525" style="s2"> She has every reason to be nervous</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.525" end="01:48:35.001" style="s2"> Especially when women are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.074" end="01:48:38.132" style="s2"> And she must be in a long time</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.132" end="01:48:41.305" style="s2"> Take care of a fragile baby who is extremely dependent on her</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.347" end="01:48:44.854" style="s2"> In addition, women are more nervous and uncomfortable than men</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.948" end="01:48:46.785" style="s2"> The empirical literature on this point is clear</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.785" end="01:48:48.581" style="s2"> It is associated with emotional instability</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.602" end="01:48:51.243" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s actually an unpleasant emotion</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.295" end="01:48:53.174" style="s2"> Who wants to be uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.289" end="01:48:55.449" style="s2"> If I am very afraid of making a fool of myself when I talk to you on stage</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.449" end="01:48:57.255" style="s2"> Then suddenly I won’t be able to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.255" end="01:48:58.800" style="s2"> What I will do is always think about myself</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.800" end="01:49:00.157" style="s2"> And all my shortcomings and mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.178" end="01:49:01.462" style="s2"> Fall into one&#39;s heart</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.026" end="01:49:04.447" style="s2"> Although this personality trait is a great talent</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.447" end="01:49:05.940" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not pleasant</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.940" end="01:49:08.216" style="s2"> It is mainly associated with anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.180" end="01:49:14.520" style="s2"> So Eve has every reason to pay attention to snakes.</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.802" end="01:49:16.211" style="s2"> I read a story this week</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.211" end="01:49:19.781" style="s2"> The bad thing is that I don’t remember which tribe it was about</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.781" end="01:49:21.921" style="s2"> But I added a footnote about this in my new book</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.842" end="01:49:28.163" style="s2"> These are people living in jungle tribes</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.205" end="01:49:31.347" style="s2"> 5% of adults have been attacked by pythons</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.378" end="01:49:33.925" style="s2"> And a large number of children were killed by pythons</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.967" end="01:49:36.806" style="s2"> Snake predation is no joke</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.806" end="01:49:38.946" style="s2"> It shapes our past in evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.946" end="01:49:41.232" style="s2"> And it still happens frequently in many areas</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.232" end="01:49:43.049" style="s2"> We have adapted to the existence of snakes</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.049" end="01:49:46.796" style="s2"> Anthropologist Lynn Isbel points out</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.088" end="01:49:50.324" style="s2"> We are very good at spotting camouflage patterns on snakes</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.324" end="01:49:53.424" style="s2"> Especially in the lower half of our vision</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.385" end="01:49:56.076" style="s2"> There is evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.076" end="01:49:58.174" style="s2"> Humans have such a keen vision</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.539" end="01:50:00.648" style="s2"> In other words, our eyes become brighter</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.898" end="01:50:03.393" style="s2"> Partly because we have co-evolved with snakes</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.424" end="01:50:04.499" style="s2"> We learn to recognize them</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.094" end="01:50:08.226" style="s2"> At the expense of our brains grow up together</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.226" end="01:50:10.188" style="s2"> You need a lot of brain capacity to see</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.397" end="01:50:12.109" style="s2"> The result of human brain growth is</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.109" end="01:50:14.270" style="s2"> One day we woke up and found the future</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.270" end="01:50:16.702" style="s2"> The future is where all snakes may live</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.765" end="01:50:18.581" style="s2"> Instead of where they are now</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.393" end="01:50:26.034" style="s2"> These same images are very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.076" end="01:50:31.149" style="s2"> In this picture, the god of death appears on the tree</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.149" end="01:50:32.036" style="s2"> With snake and fruit</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.078" end="01:50:33.904" style="s2"> The fruit also looks interesting</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.904" end="01:50:36.618" style="s2"> I already said</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.618" end="01:50:38.309" style="s2"> There is a strong correlation between the food you eat and the information</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.685" end="01:50:39.437" style="s2"> This is a conceptual connection</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.468" end="01:50:40.637" style="s2"> Is also an actual connection</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.648" end="01:50:43.236" style="s2"> And we can distinguish colors</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.236" end="01:50:44.719" style="s2"> The question is why</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.729" end="01:50:46.274" style="s2"> The answer is that we have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.274" end="01:50:47.527" style="s2"> You can distinguish ripe fruits with your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.527" end="01:50:51.086" style="s2"> In the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.097" end="01:50:52.339" style="s2"> Humans gain vision through snakes and fruits</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.339" end="01:50:54.823" style="s2"> It turns out to be correct</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.126" end="01:50:56.483" style="s2"> Great, right?</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.483" end="01:50:58.320" style="s2"> So you think that for men</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.320" end="01:50:59.395" style="s2"> What role does a woman play in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.395" end="01:51:01.274" style="s2"> First of all they make men uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.274" end="01:51:02.996" style="s2"> Let us never forget this</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.059" end="01:51:07.182" style="s2"> I want to talk about the main role of women in the relationship with men</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.182" end="01:51:08.320" style="s2"> Just to make them feel uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.362" end="01:51:10.930" style="s2"> Men don&#39;t like that much</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.930" end="01:51:14.218" style="s2"> And nothing is more disturbing than being rejected</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.698" end="01:51:16.733" style="s2"> Why is he rejected</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.733" end="01:51:19.124" style="s2"> Obviously because of mother nature</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.124" end="01:51:21.086" style="s2"> Telling you in the image of that woman</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.086" end="01:51:23.654" style="s2"> &quot;You are pretty good to be friends</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.654" end="01:51:25.804" style="s2"> &quot;But there is no special reason for your genetic material</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.804" end="01:51:27.829" style="s2"> &quot;Be spread and continue into the future&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.184" end="01:51:35.596" style="s2"> Men feel uncomfortable with being made by women</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.596" end="01:51:37.913" style="s2"> Not happy at all, right</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.923" end="01:51:40.418" style="s2"> This is between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.418" end="01:51:41.556" style="s2"> The main source of ongoing tension</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.556" end="01:51:42.433" style="s2"> It&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.444" end="01:51:43.477" style="s2"> But there is another situation</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.477" end="01:51:45.867" style="s2"> It’s pretty cool and very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.796" end="01:51:56.191" style="s2"> We and the chimpanzee were around 600 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.191" end="01:51:58.863" style="s2"> Differences appeared after the common ancestor advanced</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.863" end="01:52:00.616" style="s2"> Here are the reasons at least to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.689" end="01:52:03.477" style="s2"> Female chimpanzees are treated equally when it comes to mating</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.477" end="01:52:06.869" style="s2"> They mate with any male chimpanzee when in heat</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.879" end="01:52:09.249" style="s2"> Human women would not</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.499" end="01:52:11.013" style="s2"> When a female chimpanzee is in heat</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.013" end="01:52:13.925" style="s2"> Any male has a chance</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.113" end="01:52:16.859" style="s2"> High-status male chimpanzees drive away competitors</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.859" end="01:52:17.923" style="s2"> So the male chimpanzee with the highest status</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.923" end="01:52:19.343" style="s2"> Will be more likely to leave offspring</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.343" end="01:52:21.065" style="s2"> But it’s not the female chimpanzee’s choice</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.097" end="01:52:22.506" style="s2"> Humans are not like this</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.631" end="01:52:25.042" style="s2"> Human women often &quot;marry high&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.178" end="01:52:28.049" style="s2"> This also exists in different cultural regions</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.090" end="01:52:32.902" style="s2"> This is also widespread in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.923" end="01:52:34.677" style="s2"> There is a little attenuation but not much attenuation</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.677" end="01:52:37.287" style="s2"> Women usually marry men at a higher level of dominance</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.287" end="01:52:39.541" style="s2"> And men will marry women at a lower level of dominance</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.552" end="01:52:41.191" style="s2"> Must be like this</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.191" end="01:52:46.128" style="s2"> Because it has to be like this. If one goes up and the other goes down</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.232" end="01:52:50.804" style="s2"> The socioeconomic status of a woman</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.804" end="01:52:53.915" style="s2"> Has little effect on her attractiveness to men</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.009" end="01:52:56.232" style="s2"> The socioeconomic status of a man</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.232" end="01:52:59.051" style="s2"> Is the main determinant of his attractiveness to women</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.051" end="01:53:00.408" style="s2"> And it doesn’t mean his wealth</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.408" end="01:53:01.953" style="s2"> This has been proven</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.067" end="01:53:06.201" style="s2"> But refers to his ability to produce and share</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.222" end="01:53:07.944" style="s2"> This is much better than wealth</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.955" end="01:53:11.744" style="s2"> Wealth will disappear but this ability to produce and share</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.744" end="01:53:14.729" style="s2"> Is a more important factor</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.729" end="01:53:16.786" style="s2"> Then why not choose on this basis</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.786" end="01:53:18.518" style="s2"> Especially when women have to have babies</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.518" end="01:53:20.877" style="s2"> And babies make women more dependent</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.877" end="01:53:23.925" style="s2"> Women are only from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.925" end="01:53:25.689" style="s2"> Look at it logically</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.689" end="01:53:28.644" style="s2"> Who has the ability to reach out for help at critical moments</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.126" end="01:53:32.725" style="s2"> It’s no surprise that women make strong demands on men</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.725" end="01:53:37.443" style="s2"> The problem is that women are more &quot;high-married&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.443" end="01:53:39.802" style="s2"> Humans evolved more quickly than chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.802" end="01:53:43.090" style="s2"> This selection pressure exerted by women on men</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.090" end="01:53:44.729" style="s2"> Affected the development of our entire species</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.729" end="01:53:47.109" style="s2"> Two things happened as far as I know</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.109" end="01:53:49.687" style="s2"> Men compete for ability</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.969" end="01:53:52.673" style="s2"> So the male hierarchy is a mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.683" end="01:53:54.562" style="s2"> Push the best people to the top</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.562" end="01:53:55.804" style="s2"> Is indeed the same as the meaning of the system itself</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.888" end="01:53:59.802" style="s2"> Then its effect will be due to</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.802" end="01:54:02.099" style="s2"> Women marry to the top of the ranks and doubly significant</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.099" end="01:54:05.494" style="s2"> The most capable men are more likely to leave offspring</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.494" end="01:54:10.230" style="s2"> This seems to be the reason for the expansion of our cortex</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.230" end="01:54:11.431" style="s2"> This kind of expansion during the evolutionary period</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.431" end="01:54:13.372" style="s2"> Happened very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.692" end="01:54:19.124" style="s2"> &quot;So the woman saw that the fruit of that tree was good for food</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.124" end="01:54:20.502" style="s2"> &quot;Also pleasing to the eyes and lovable</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.502" end="01:54:23.988" style="s2"> &quot;It can make people wise</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.105" end="01:54:26.994" style="s2"> &quot;Just pick the fruit and eat it</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.994" end="01:54:29.458" style="s2"> &quot;Give it to her husband and her husband to eat too&quot; (Gen 3:6)</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.458" end="01:54:31.337" style="s2"> Oh yes, women share food</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.723" end="01:54:33.393" style="s2"> This is a very strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.393" end="01:54:36.679" style="s2"> Because most creatures don’t share food</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.679" end="01:54:37.829" style="s2"> If you are a wolf</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.829" end="01:54:39.353" style="s2"> And gain something from the hunt</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.385" end="01:54:40.470" style="s2"> You will fill yourself</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.470" end="01:54:42.579" style="s2"> The leading animal will eat first</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.579" end="01:54:43.988" style="s2"> If there is left</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.988" end="01:54:45.355" style="s2"> Subordinate animals can also eat</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.355" end="01:54:46.483" style="s2"> But humans are not like this</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.483" end="01:54:48.080" style="s2"> We share food</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.080" end="01:54:49.823" style="s2"> And you can imagine how this behavior evolved</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.886" end="01:54:53.445" style="s2"> Many females share food with their children</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.727" end="01:54:55.658" style="s2"> Understanding from the perspective of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.658" end="01:54:57.057" style="s2"> It&#39;s not difficult</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.057" end="01:54:59.802" style="s2"> Knowing that you are not just sharing food with your kids</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.802" end="01:55:01.243" style="s2"> Like sharing with your partner</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.243" end="01:55:03.591" style="s2"> This is another way for you to attract a spouse</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.591" end="01:55:06.086" style="s2"> It’s like saying that we will be together better than living alone</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.117" end="01:55:07.871" style="s2"> This is the part of sharing fruits</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.871" end="01:55:09.667" style="s2"> What about the uncomfortable part</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.667" end="01:55:11.587" style="s2"> This is part of the bargaining</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.587" end="01:55:13.664" style="s2"> I will wake you up</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.664" end="01:55:16.441" style="s2"> Partly because you need to be woken up</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.441" end="01:55:18.842" style="s2"> Partly because I have a baby that needs to be taken care of</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.842" end="01:55:20.554" style="s2"> So you better wake up</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.585" end="01:55:24.654" style="s2"> In exchange I will give you some food</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.654" end="01:55:26.879" style="s2"> In response we will form a team</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.879" end="01:55:29.886" style="s2"> This is the agreement between people</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.886" end="01:55:31.577" style="s2"> This is why we will more or less</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.577" end="01:55:32.443" style="s2"> Practice monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.443" end="01:55:33.905" style="s2"> Which is why we will more or less</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.925" end="01:55:34.781" style="s2"> Pair and combine</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.781" end="01:55:37.026" style="s2"> This is why this kind of marriage-like thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.026" end="01:55:38.341" style="s2"> Universal to humans</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.550" end="01:55:39.740" style="s2"> This exists in different cultural regions</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.740" end="01:55:41.984" style="s2"> You can find exceptions but who cares</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.944" end="01:55:44.781" style="s2"> Who really cares</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.802" end="01:55:47.829" style="s2"> Look at this huge model</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.030" end="01:55:49.980" style="s2"> Well, the result of having a bigger brain is</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.032" end="01:55:52.328" style="s2"> We become very dependent</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.328" end="01:55:54.353" style="s2"> And it took us a long time to adapt</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.353" end="01:55:57.537" style="s2"> Because we need a relatively stable family bond</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.537" end="01:55:59.593" style="s2"> This is basically what we have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.593" end="01:56:02.568" style="s2"> It is impossible to achieve this without disturbing men</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.568" end="01:56:03.978" style="s2"> For male creatures</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.978" end="01:56:05.982" style="s2"> Why not let the female get pregnant and go away</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.982" end="01:56:09.667" style="s2"> Really why</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.667" end="01:56:10.919" style="s2"> This is what we need to consider</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.950" end="01:56:13.591" style="s2"> Men abandon their children</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.591" end="01:56:14.228" style="s2"> Not something difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.312" end="01:56:17.652" style="s2"> But the man insisted on staying</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.652" end="01:56:18.852" style="s2"> This is incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.852" end="01:56:21.149" style="s2"> You just need to look at the animal kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.149" end="01:56:24.207" style="s2"> The easiest and easiest thing</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.207" end="01:56:26.577" style="s2"> Always the most likely to happen</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.942" end="01:56:30.804" style="s2"> So those exceptional long-term commitments need to be explained</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.454" end="01:56:33.905" style="s2"> &quot;Just pick the fruit and eat it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.905" end="01:56:36.159" style="s2"> &quot;Give it to her husband and her husband to eat too&quot; (Genesis 3:6)</p>

<p begin="01:56:46.942" end="01:56:47.955" style="s2"> Their eyes opened</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.320" end="01:56:49.907" style="s2"> This shows that they are different from the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.907" end="01:56:51.483" style="s2"> No matter what kind of people God created</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.556" end="01:56:52.370" style="s2"> They were blind at first</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.111" end="01:56:54.938" style="s2"> The blindness mentioned here is not blind in the usual sense</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.938" end="01:56:56.973" style="s2"> They are not walking around in the Garden of Eden</p>

<p begin="01:56:58.424" end="01:57:00.512" style="s2"> But refers to &quot;blindness&quot; in the abstract sense</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.512" end="01:57:03.132" style="s2"> This &quot;blindness&quot; is eliminated by what just happened</p>

<p begin="01:57:04.458" end="01:57:06.243" style="s2"> At the same time make them aware that they are naked</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.629" end="01:57:08.696" style="s2"> What does &quot;bright eyes&quot; mean</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.009" end="01:57:11.149" style="s2"> What does it mean to know that you are naked?</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.203" end="01:57:14.072" style="s2"> It means you realize that you are vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.823" end="01:57:16.107" style="s2"> What people found is this</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.243" end="01:57:17.464" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.819" end="01:57:18.518" style="s2"> We might get hurt like this</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.998" end="01:57:21.671" style="s2"> It’s like you are one of a group of zebras</p>

<p begin="01:57:28.633" end="01:57:30.209" style="s2"> The lying lion is not a problem for you</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.522" end="01:57:31.232" style="s2"> When he stands up</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.232" end="01:57:32.600" style="s2"> It becomes a big problem when you are ready to hunt</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.829" end="01:57:33.936" style="s2"> You are not smart enough to tell</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.936" end="01:57:35.564" style="s2"> When the Lions lie down</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.564" end="01:57:37.172" style="s2"> Stand up and start hunting</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.433" end="01:57:40.616" style="s2"> So you didn’t build a fortress to keep the lion out</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.867" end="01:57:42.694" style="s2"> You are just eating grass carelessly</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.007" end="01:57:43.957" style="s2"> You are not alert</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.406" end="01:57:45.950" style="s2"> But humans are different</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.950" end="01:57:47.224" style="s2"> Humans awakened and they found</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.558" end="01:57:48.268" style="s2"> I am vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.529" end="01:57:50.877" style="s2"> And it will always be so fragile and will follow you</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.120" end="01:57:56.097" style="s2"> Human beings realize that their vulnerability is eternal</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.472" end="01:57:57.109" style="s2"> What happened after</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.203" end="01:57:58.769" style="s2"> The first thing they do is put on clothes</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.113" end="01:58:01.117" style="s2"> When you are naked</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.117" end="01:58:02.537" style="s2"> What do you do when you want to protect yourself from various threats</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.537" end="01:58:04.834" style="s2"> Obviously look around you are all wearing clothes</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.825" end="01:58:06.504" style="s2"> why?</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.078" end="01:58:10.418" style="s2"> We did this for a long, long time</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.418" end="01:58:12.276" style="s2"> At least since tens of thousands of years ago</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.028" end="01:58:14.374" style="s2"> In fact, how much you can track</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.458" end="01:58:15.940" style="s2"> When did clothing develop</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.940" end="01:58:18.299" style="s2"> Because you can attach it to clothes instead of hair</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.299" end="01:58:20.021" style="s2"> Of lice do DNA test</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.021" end="01:58:23.403" style="s2"> We have a clear understanding of when clothing will appear</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.675" end="01:58:25.011" style="s2"> Also know that there are different types of clothing</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.230" end="01:58:26.097" style="s2"> This is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.097" end="01:58:27.746" style="s2"> But the point is that Adam and Eve was naked at first</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.746" end="01:58:29.353" style="s2"> It&#39;s not so good for them to think of this</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.635" end="01:58:30.335" style="s2"> Because we are fragile</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.335" end="01:58:31.577" style="s2"> Their eyes are already bright</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.577" end="01:58:32.871" style="s2"> So they have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.289" end="01:58:34.698" style="s2"> They found their vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.698" end="01:58:35.606" style="s2"> The first thing they did</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.606" end="01:58:37.109" style="s2"> Took the first step of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.443" end="01:58:39.781" style="s2"> Protect yourself with things that already exist in the world</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.084" end="01:58:41.660" style="s2"> You protect yourself from the dangerous world</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.660" end="01:58:43.236" style="s2"> Stay away from prying eyes</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.917" end="01:58:46.337" style="s2"> This is Lynn Isbel&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.431" end="01:58:47.412" style="s2"> A passage from &quot;Why We See So Clear&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.216" end="01:58:49.458" style="s2"> &quot;Temptation from Eve</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.479" end="01:58:51.285" style="s2"> &quot;To the mighty Thor was killed by the snake venom</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.285" end="01:58:52.026" style="s2"> &quot;The snake&#39;s figure always runs through</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.026" end="01:58:53.174" style="s2"> &quot;Over time and various cultures</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.174" end="01:58:55.105" style="s2"> &quot;It is considered a symbol of disaster and pain&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.700" end="01:58:57.193" style="s2"> &quot;Snakes are notorious all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.193" end="01:58:58.685" style="s2"> &quot;Whether in religious mythology or folklore</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.685" end="01:59:00.616" style="s2"> &quot;All highlight our connection with snakes</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.971" end="01:59:01.504" style="s2"> &quot;But why</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.817" end="01:59:02.735" style="s2"> &quot;Since there are only a few of us</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.735" end="01:59:03.727" style="s2"> &quot;I have encountered a snake myself&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.021" end="01:59:07.088" style="s2"> &quot;This book gives a surprising answer</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.088" end="01:59:10.742" style="s2"> &quot;The answer lies in the unique influence of snakes on the evolution of primates.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.107" end="01:59:12.495" style="s2"> &quot;Isbel told us</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.495" end="01:59:13.518" style="s2"> &quot;The predation pressure of snakes on us</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.518" end="01:59:14.990" style="s2"> &quot;It makes us sharper vision and bigger brain</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.990" end="01:59:17.245" style="s2"> &quot;The ultimate reason</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.433" end="01:59:19.322" style="s2"> &quot;This may be the evolution of primates and humans</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.322" end="01:59:20.491" style="s2"> &quot;A crucial step&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.815" end="01:59:22.078" style="s2"> This has been proven recently</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.579" end="01:59:24.353" style="s2"> Psychologists have known for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.353" end="01:59:26.232" style="s2"> People’s fear of snakes can be acquired</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.378" end="01:59:29.280" style="s2"> But they found that a group of primate neurons</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.416" end="01:59:30.742" style="s2"> Thalamic-occipital neuron</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.086" end="01:59:32.767" style="s2"> Has a special purpose</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.934" end="01:59:35.742" style="s2"> This is a very old sensory system</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.034" end="01:59:37.485" style="s2"> &quot;The thalamus-occipital neuron group is neurobiologically confirmed</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.485" end="01:59:40.815" style="s2"> &quot;Our past evolution is to find snakes quickly&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.815" end="01:59:42.433" style="s2"> This is a 2013 study</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.882" end="01:59:45.209" style="s2"> So the snake did wake us up</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.443" end="01:59:50.324" style="s2"> Color vision is evolved by primates in order to adapt to eating fruits</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.971" end="01:59:53.602" style="s2"> It seems that women want to attract men</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.602" end="01:59:56.973" style="s2"> And it’s no coincidence to dress yourself up like a ripe fruit</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.683" end="02:00:00.293" style="s2"> And this is not because of social culture</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.226" end="02:00:04.625" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s a cool breeze, the Lord God is walking in the garden</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.625" end="02:00:06.483" style="s2"> &quot;The man and his wife heard the voice of God</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.817" end="02:00:09.614" style="s2"> &quot;Hidden in the trees in the garden</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.614" end="02:00:10.857" style="s2"> &quot;Hide from the face of the Lord God&quot; (Genesis 3:8)</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.191" end="02:00:12.099" style="s2"> This passage is very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.278" end="02:00:14.280" style="s2"> What is the meaning</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.896" end="02:00:16.639" style="s2"> Before humanity awakens</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.817" end="02:00:19.844" style="s2"> Before I found myself naked and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.679" end="02:00:23.623" style="s2"> There is no need for humans to avoid God</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.769" end="02:00:24.948" style="s2"> Are they now avoiding God?</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.470" end="02:00:27.715" style="s2"> Are they naked and fragile</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.871" end="02:00:29.228" style="s2"> Let&#39;s think about it</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.353" end="02:00:30.449" style="s2"> Think about it</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.067" end="02:00:34.270" style="s2"> Imagine you have the ability to live</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.479" end="02:00:37.193" style="s2"> Sincere, brave and frank</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.339" end="02:00:38.080" style="s2"> Let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.122" end="02:00:40.543" style="s2"> Then think about why you wouldn’t do that</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.264" end="02:00:43.581" style="s2"> Is it because of fear and shame</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.581" end="02:00:44.437" style="s2"> How they stop you</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.065" end="02:00:47.976" style="s2"> Imagine we have been to a</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.976" end="02:00:51.754" style="s2"> The idea of ​​being sincere, brave and frank is a bit similar to</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.765" end="02:00:53.727" style="s2"> We already know from the story</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.727" end="02:00:55.324" style="s2"> Walk with God in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.679" end="02:00:56.994" style="s2"> What prevents people from doing this</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.994" end="02:00:58.310" style="s2"> What prevents people from hiding</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.967" end="02:01:01.608" style="s2"> Because they found their shortcomings</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.608" end="02:01:02.902" style="s2"> They looked at and felt</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.414" end="02:01:06.399" style="s2"> If everything around me is a mess</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.859" end="02:01:09.677" style="s2"> So a creature like me</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.729" end="02:01:11.650" style="s2"> How to survive in this world</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.328" end="02:01:13.383" style="s2"> Think about what you are avoiding</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.581" end="02:01:16.191" style="s2"> You go home and sit on your own bed for five minutes</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.191" end="02:01:18.383" style="s2"> Ask yourself what you are avoiding</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.821" end="02:01:22.078" style="s2"> God will gradually appear in your mind</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.078" end="02:01:23.362" style="s2"> Thousands of answers</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.019" end="02:01:25.439" style="s2"> Now let&#39;s see why you are running away</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.763" end="02:01:27.224" style="s2"> No doubt you are running away</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.892" end="02:01:29.343" style="s2"> People are running away from this is nothing new</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.583" end="02:01:31.733" style="s2"> This is the horror of this story</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.193" end="02:01:33.153" style="s2"> Every morning we wake up and think</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.153" end="02:01:34.719" style="s2"> Gosh look at this place</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.719" end="02:01:37.589" style="s2"> There are many tricky troubles</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.589" end="02:01:38.644" style="s2"> And we ourselves are in trouble</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.644" end="02:01:39.938" style="s2"> And we failed to live what we should be</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.449" end="02:01:41.692" style="s2"> So we hid</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.078" end="02:01:43.257" style="s2"> This is what this story is about</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.383" end="02:01:45.209" style="s2"> People wake up with self-awareness</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.533" end="02:01:47.130" style="s2"> Found his own vulnerability</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.401" end="02:01:49.113" style="s2"> This vulnerability keeps them in hiding</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.385" end="02:01:51.911" style="s2"> In order to escape from fulfilling his sacred destiny</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.255" end="02:01:53.623" style="s2"> Completely correct</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.999" end="02:01:55.846" style="s2"> I really like this part of the story</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.514" end="02:01:57.099" style="s2"> This part is very interesting,</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.685" end="02:02:00.272" style="s2"> We can use this part to relax</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.316" end="02:02:03.623" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah God called the man to say</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.842" end="02:02:04.614" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Where are you&quot;&quot; (Genesis 3:9)</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.449" end="02:02:09.092" style="s2"> &quot;He said, &quot;I heard your voice in the garden</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.865" end="02:02:11.003" style="s2"> &quot;『I’m scared</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.441" end="02:02:12.735" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Because I am naked&quot;&quot; (Genesis 3:10)</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.944" end="02:02:15.262" style="s2"> There is no doubt that this is why he hid</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.825" end="02:02:16.775" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;I hid&quot;&quot; (Genesis 3:10)</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.280" end="02:02:27.276" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord said,&#39;Who told you that you were naked</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.508" end="02:02:29.761" style="s2"> &quot;『Can you eat it?</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.917" end="02:02:30.909" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I told you not to eat</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.264" end="02:02:32.182" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;The fruit on the tree?&quot; (Genesis 3:11)</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.122" end="02:02:38.049" style="s2"> This is the glorious moment of Adam after the &quot;fall&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.191" end="02:02:43.310" style="s2"> &quot;The man said, &quot;That woman</p>

<p begin="02:02:54.698" end="02:02:55.951" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;She gave me the fruit from that tree,</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.951" end="02:02:56.566" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I&#39;ll eat it&quot;&#39; (Genesis 3:12)</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.848" end="02:02:58.487" style="s2"> This is the sad man</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.316" end="02:03:04.228" style="s2"> In addition, some modern feminists think</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.614" end="02:03:07.297" style="s2"> The story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.297" end="02:03:11.556" style="s2"> Portray Eve as a villain against humanity</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.932" end="02:03:14.500" style="s2"> Because she ate the forbidden fruit against the will of God</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.001" end="02:03:16.316" style="s2"> Yes</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.360" end="02:03:18.456" style="s2"> Looks like she fell first</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.030" end="02:03:20.679" style="s2"> Seduced her husband again</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.763" end="02:03:23.257" style="s2"> Make them all worse</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.456" end="02:03:27.005" style="s2"> Of course Adam was so stupid that he ate it immediately</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.015" end="02:03:27.673" style="s2"> This means</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.673" end="02:03:30.063" style="s2"> She was braver than her husband and awakened first</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.815" end="02:03:34.364" style="s2"> I think Adam is really in this story</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.364" end="02:03:35.042" style="s2"> A sad creature</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.335" end="02:03:36.942" style="s2"> Let’s review what he did in a few words</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.456" end="02:03:40.345" style="s2"> First of all this is not what I did, it was given to me by Eve</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.794" end="02:03:42.454" style="s2"> Then he blamed God</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.976" end="02:03:47.266" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s the woman you gave me&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.938" end="02:03:51.702" style="s2"> &quot;She gave me the fruit and I ate it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.702" end="02:03:53.414" style="s2"> It sounds like Adam is completely innocent</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.414" end="02:03:54.186" style="s2"> Except now</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.573" end="02:04:02.266" style="s2"> He is not only naked, rebellious and cowardly shameful</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.767" end="02:04:06.796" style="s2"> He is still a crying slander behind his back</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.276" end="02:04:10.397" style="s2"> He turned his back on Eve without hesitation</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.481" end="02:04:11.775" style="s2"> I blamed God</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.140" end="02:04:14.708" style="s2"> This is true</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.875" end="02:04:19.197" style="s2"> You go online to see when men hold resentment against women</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.197" end="02:04:20.898" style="s2"> Comments written on women</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.493" end="02:04:22.996" style="s2"> So funny</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.996" end="02:04:25.345" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not my fault, it&#39;s those little bitches who smashed&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.516" end="02:04:28.633" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s them&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.134" end="02:04:32.631" style="s2"> Not only that, they also blamed others</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.049" end="02:04:36.003" style="s2"> This is exactly the same as the story shows</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.191" end="02:04:38.591" style="s2"> Really sad and contemptible</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.550" end="02:04:50.282" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God said to women</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.439" end="02:04:51.702" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;What are you doing?&#39;</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.702" end="02:04:52.443" style="s2"> &quot;The woman said</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.443" end="02:04:54.040" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;The snake tempted me and I ate it&quot; (Genesis 3:13)</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.040" end="02:04:56.285" style="s2"> Well at least she has an excuse</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.754" end="02:04:57.850" style="s2"> First it is a snake</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.850" end="02:04:58.748" style="s2"> Actually</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.748" end="02:05:00.606" style="s2"> We have already said that snakes are very cunning</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.909" end="02:05:04.019" style="s2"> Secondly, the snake gradually evolved into Satan himself</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.458" end="02:05:05.846" style="s2"> Very insidious and cunning</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.940" end="02:05:10.512" style="s2"> So Eve fell into the snake trap</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.775" end="02:05:13.310" style="s2"> This is indeed blameworthy</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.414" end="02:05:16.211" style="s2"> But Biyadan’s excuse is so good that I don’t know where it is.</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.506" end="02:05:19.207" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord God said to the snake</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.207" end="02:05:20.825" style="s2"> &quot;『Since you did this</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.253" end="02:05:22.537" style="s2"> &quot;『You will be cursed</p>

<p begin="02:05:31.285" end="02:05:32.088" style="s2"> Incidentally</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.088" end="02:05:34.531" style="s2"> A snake is a lizard without legs</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.948" end="02:05:35.825" style="s2"> You should all understand</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.441" end="02:05:38.665" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I want you and the woman to be enemies</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.614" end="02:05:40.877" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Your descendants and women&#39;s descendants are also hostile to each other</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.888" end="02:05:42.464" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;A woman&#39;s descendant will hurt your head</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.464" end="02:05:44.385" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;You will hurt his heel&#39;&quot; (Genesis 3:15)</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.376" end="02:05:46.733" style="s2"> I like these two paintings very much</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.733" end="02:05:47.537" style="s2"> Exquisite</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.621" end="02:05:48.132" style="s2"> By the way</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.249" end="02:05:53.163" style="s2"> Regardless of the religious background</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.581" end="02:05:54.364" style="s2"> What do you see</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.074" end="02:05:56.420" style="s2"> The eternal mother holds her child</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.589" end="02:06:01.441" style="s2"> Protect him from snakes</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.078" end="02:06:02.673" style="s2"> See it right below the picture</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.356" end="02:06:07.464" style="s2"> Crocodile snake</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.124" end="02:06:12.214" style="s2"> These are the animals that have preyed on us for the past 600,000 years</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.809" end="02:06:14.458" style="s2"> It’s the protection of the mother of eternity that keeps us alive today</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.658" end="02:06:16.681" style="s2"> That&#39;s why this is a sacred painting</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.456" end="02:06:19.761" style="s2"> I prefer the picture on the right</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.535" end="02:06:22.913" style="s2"> It looks like the moon below</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.913" end="02:06:26.118" style="s2"> Eve stepped on this reptile</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.118" end="02:06:26.921" style="s2"> This form is very old</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.921" end="02:06:28.205" style="s2"> I may have shown it to you before</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.205" end="02:06:29.374" style="s2"> But I think this is really great</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.687" end="02:06:31.953" style="s2"> She emerged from a ring in the sky</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.955" end="02:06:36.399" style="s2"> This symbolizes eternal reincarnation in her</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.660" end="02:06:37.339" style="s2"> you can say so</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.433" end="02:06:39.134" style="s2"> This eternal reincarnation</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.353" end="02:06:40.074" style="s2"> Is a prototype</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.600" end="02:06:44.166" style="s2"> It implies that she is being born</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.166" end="02:06:45.898" style="s2"> Behind this are some musical instruments</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.608" end="02:06:48.341" style="s2"> What the painter wants to show is</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.696" end="02:06:51.472" style="s2"> The intricacies of the great life forms of life</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.120" end="02:06:56.138" style="s2"> Protect our mother from being born from the background</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.462" end="02:06:58.059" style="s2"> Protect the child forever</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.059" end="02:06:59.406" style="s2"> Keep them from being prey</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.147" end="02:07:02.036" style="s2"> How can this not be a sacred sight</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.464" end="02:07:04.948" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.178" end="02:07:06.608" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s not a matter of painting</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.600" end="02:07:09.228" style="s2"> It&#39;s your problem</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.733" end="02:07:12.850" style="s2"> &quot;To the woman again&quot; (Genesis 3:16)</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.101" end="02:07:15.836" style="s2"> Now God just lists the consequences of stealing the forbidden fruit</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.034" end="02:07:17.850" style="s2"> As if you were asleep</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.850" end="02:07:18.518" style="s2"> After you wake up</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.779" end="02:07:19.865" style="s2"> These things will happen</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.982" end="02:07:23.289" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I will increase your pain of pregnancy</p>

<p begin="02:07:31.180" end="02:07:32.120" style="s2"> God still didn&#39;t say he should</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.090" end="02:07:33.842" style="s2"> But that he is going to</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.763" end="02:07:36.368" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.368" end="02:07:38.195" style="s2"> &quot;You will suffer more when you give birth to children&quot; (Genesis 3:16)</p>

<p begin="02:07:47.861" end="02:07:49.134" style="s2"> And then people created something</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.134" end="02:07:50.533" style="s2"> Something based on faith</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.243" end="02:07:55.387" style="s2"> This can be said to be one of the curses to humans</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.003" end="02:07:59.218" style="s2"> So this is the punishment Eve received for awakening</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.126" end="02:08:00.763" style="s2"> &quot;Said to Adam</p>

<p begin="02:08:14.218" end="02:08:15.095" style="s2"> This is the emergence of the concept of &quot;work&quot;</p>

<p begin="02:08:20.971" end="02:08:22.088" style="s2"> It defines the concept of work</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.631" end="02:08:24.322" style="s2"> What is the difference between human behavior and animals</p>

<p begin="02:08:29.761" end="02:08:30.554" style="s2"> Why people do this</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.971" end="02:08:32.067" style="s2"> Because they are aware of their vulnerability</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.495" end="02:08:33.247" style="s2"> They have awakened</p>

<p begin="02:10:10.429" end="02:10:13.341" style="s2"> Adam and Eve were tempted by a snake</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.372" end="02:10:13.936" style="s2"> So I ate the forbidden fruit</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.988" end="02:10:14.479" style="s2"> Wake them up</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.562" end="02:10:15.314" style="s2"> They realized that they were naked</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.067" end="02:10:18.195" style="s2"> Realize that I am vulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.195" end="02:10:19.218" style="s2"> Aware of the future</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.218" end="02:10:20.293" style="s2"> Realized that I will die</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.387" end="02:10:21.629" style="s2"> Realize that I have to work</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.038" end="02:10:24.896" style="s2"> Realized the difficulty of fertility</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.491" end="02:10:27.965" style="s2"> Ever since lost the subconscious garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.685" end="02:10:30.356" style="s2"> All of this makes sense</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.034" end="02:10:32.673" style="s2"> But what is the perception of good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.633" end="02:10:34.875" style="s2"> What does the knowledge of good and evil mean to them</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.525" end="02:10:37.871" style="s2"> In Mesopotamian mythology</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.955" end="02:10:40.846" style="s2"> Goddess of Chaos, Diamat, according to what she can imagine</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.191" end="02:10:42.276" style="s2"> Worst monster image</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.276" end="02:10:46.723" style="s2"> Created mankind with Jin Gu&#39;s blood</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.151" end="02:10:52.965" style="s2"> Their thoughts are in the deepest part of human nature</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.247" end="02:10:54.447" style="s2"> There are cracks ripped by the devil</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.080" end="02:10:59.186" style="s2"> This is what they think</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.450" end="02:11:02.725" style="s2"> These stories are all born in a similar context</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.665" end="02:11:05.168" style="s2"> So open your eyes</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.168" end="02:11:06.786" style="s2"> Aware of their vulnerability</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.370" end="02:11:08.967" style="s2"> What does it have to do with the knowledge of good and evil?</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.468" end="02:11:11.295" style="s2"> I thought about it very seriously</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.295" end="02:11:12.120" style="s2"> I must say</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.130" end="02:11:13.404" style="s2"> I thought about it for 20 years</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.581" end="02:11:14.667" style="s2"> Because I know there is something in these stories</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.667" end="02:11:15.898" style="s2"> I can&#39;t unify them</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.326" end="02:11:17.255" style="s2"> at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.101" end="02:11:19.072" style="s2"> I am also reading the literature</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.437" end="02:11:21.650" style="s2"> I want to tell you an unfortunate fact</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.130" end="02:11:23.571" style="s2"> If you need high-energy warning</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.571" end="02:11:24.520" style="s2"> I will give you one now</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.439" end="02:11:26.128" style="s2"> Trust me</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.420" end="02:11:28.017" style="s2"> I never give people warning easily</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.915" end="02:11:30.700" style="s2"> The things I want to tell you you will never forget</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.639" end="02:11:34.437" style="s2"> This is what Unit 731 did in China</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.646" end="02:11:36.848" style="s2"> 731 was a Japanese army during World War II</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.882" end="02:11:38.936" style="s2"> What i know is</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.207" end="02:11:40.533" style="s2"> During the Second World War</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.533" end="02:11:42.214" style="s2"> Did something pretty creepy</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.704" end="02:11:43.633" style="s2"> Really outrageous</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.333" end="02:11:45.115" style="s2"> What they do is</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.164" end="02:11:53.508" style="s2"> Gather the prisoners in one place</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.967" end="02:11:55.470" style="s2"> Hold their arms completely</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.817" end="02:11:58.164" style="s2"> Then take the captive out</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.051" end="02:12:00.742" style="s2"> Pour boiling water on the captive&#39;s arm</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.744" end="02:12:04.834" style="s2"> Repeat this until the captive is separated</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.170" end="02:12:07.819" style="s2"> They claim to do this for research</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.779" end="02:12:10.502" style="s2"> &quot;How to heal soldiers&#39; frostbite&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.525" end="02:12:13.153" style="s2"> Unless you want to have a nightmare</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.153" end="02:12:14.134" style="s2"> Don&#39;t care about Unit 731</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.209" end="02:12:16.681" style="s2"> This is Unit 731</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.422" end="02:12:18.299" style="s2"> This is human</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.811" end="02:12:19.855" style="s2"> Someone patted his head and came up with this idea</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.189" end="02:12:21.275" style="s2"> Some people implemented it recklessly</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.176" end="02:12:25.460" style="s2"> What is the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.170" end="02:12:27.903" style="s2"> This is the point</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.594" end="02:12:30.481" style="s2"> You know you are vulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.285" end="02:12:32.412" style="s2"> No other animal knows</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.871" end="02:12:34.186" style="s2"> You know what will hurt you</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.533" end="02:12:38.122" style="s2"> Now that you know you are vulnerable and what will hurt you</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.228" end="02:12:41.441" style="s2"> You know what can hurt others</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.662" end="02:12:44.677" style="s2"> Once you know what can hurt others</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.750" end="02:12:45.919" style="s2"> You can use the method of hurting others</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.462" end="02:12:47.736" style="s2"> Because you can distinguish good from evil</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.717" end="02:12:50.690" style="s2"> Snakes are really tricky</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.690" end="02:12:51.493" style="s2"> Because of something</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.493" end="02:12:53.550" style="s2"> If we know the result in advance</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.852" end="02:12:55.491" style="s2"> We might not want to try</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.170" end="02:12:58.028" style="s2"> But once humans have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.435" end="02:12:59.865" style="s2"> Aware of his nakedness</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.324" end="02:13:01.598" style="s2"> He has the ability to do evil</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.099" end="02:13:05.074" style="s2"> From here on this situation is known to the world</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.366" end="02:13:06.733" style="s2"> The rest of the story is</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.435" end="02:13:09.458" style="s2"> There are already snakes in the world, right</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.458" end="02:13:11.180" style="s2"> If you are a primate living in a tree</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.180" end="02:13:12.182" style="s2"> You know snakes can prey on primates</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.589" end="02:13:13.257" style="s2"> It&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.257" end="02:13:15.564" style="s2"> So you want to stay alert to snakes</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.295" end="02:13:17.913" style="s2"> So your brain grows</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.923" end="02:13:18.529" style="s2"> You can think about it</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.145" end="02:13:20.919" style="s2"> There are more than just snakes on the tree</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.982" end="02:13:21.953" style="s2"> The tree is where the snake lives</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.963" end="02:13:23.602" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t we get down from the tree</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.644" end="02:13:24.740" style="s2"> Hunt them and then</p>
<p begin="02:13:24.740" end="02:13:25.293" style="s2"> Get rid of them</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.752" end="02:13:27.214" style="s2"> They are kind of like potential snakes</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.320" end="02:13:30.084" style="s2"> So the snake becomes a potential snake</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.084" end="02:13:32.944" style="s2"> The loop you use to handle this is the same</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.257" end="02:13:34.416" style="s2"> You have to get rid of the snake</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.677" end="02:13:37.850" style="s2"> Just like St. Patrick drove the snake out of Ireland</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.850" end="02:13:38.529" style="s2"> No more snakes</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.769" end="02:13:39.646" style="s2"> Here is heaven</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.750" end="02:13:41.295" style="s2"> No no no no</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.337" end="02:13:42.903" style="s2"> Things will not develop like this</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.903" end="02:13:44.792" style="s2"> You find someone has become a snake</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.053" end="02:13:45.836" style="s2"> Suppose you live in a tribe</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.055" end="02:13:47.120" style="s2"> You will have hostile tribes</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.454" end="02:13:51.462" style="s2"> You have to protect yourself from them, right</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.546" end="02:13:54.113" style="s2"> Maybe your power has grown</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.113" end="02:13:55.450" style="s2"> You defeated all the enemies</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.086" end="02:13:56.869" style="s2"> What will happen next</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.454" end="02:13:59.458" style="s2"> Snakes will appear from within you</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.523" end="02:14:01.921" style="s2"> Even if you eliminate all external enemies</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.953" end="02:14:03.017" style="s2"> Built a big city</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.247" end="02:14:05.742" style="s2"> The enemy will continue to emerge from within you</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.692" end="02:14:08.257" style="s2"> The snake not only represents the snake in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.257" end="02:14:10.168" style="s2"> Not just a realistic snake</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.512" end="02:14:12.516" style="s2"> Not just your enemy</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.247" end="02:14:14.364" style="s2"> Snake may be your friend</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.201" end="02:14:17.777" style="s2"> Because your friend might betray you</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.143" end="02:14:19.364" style="s2"> There is something worse than this</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.324" end="02:14:21.556" style="s2"> You might betray yourself</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.287" end="02:14:24.218" style="s2"> Even if you get rid of all the snakes outside</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.750" end="02:14:26.055" style="s2"> You yourself are always a snake that cannot be eliminated</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.598" end="02:14:28.226" style="s2"> No one knows why</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.905" end="02:14:31.671" style="s2"> This is why Christians want to put</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.671" end="02:14:33.759" style="s2"> The snake in the Garden of Eden is connected with Satan</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.395" end="02:14:36.295" style="s2"> How clever this is</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.994" end="02:14:38.028" style="s2"> Think about it</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.310" end="02:14:39.176" style="s2"> Who is my enemy</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.948" end="02:14:41.399" style="s2"> Yes it&#39;s a snake</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.130" end="02:14:42.569" style="s2"> But you have to know if you are</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.569" end="02:14:44.312" style="s2"> Primates inhabiting trees are good for you</p>
<p begin="02:14:44.656" end="02:14:46.577" style="s2"> You are one after 6 million years</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.963" end="02:14:49.489" style="s2"> Precision humans born with extra evolution</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.938" end="02:14:51.963" style="s2"> You spent a lot of effort to solve</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.963" end="02:14:55.074" style="s2"> &quot;What is the greatest enemy of mankind?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.804" end="02:14:59.207" style="s2"> Human nature is inherently evil</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.209" end="02:15:01.859" style="s2"> This is the symbol of Satan</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.859" end="02:15:03.195" style="s2"> This symbol means</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.237" end="02:15:04.771" style="s2"> Just like there are logos in the world</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.834" end="02:15:06.013" style="s2"> The truth at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.650" end="02:15:09.938" style="s2"> Summoned from the chaos</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.199" end="02:15:12.287" style="s2"> There is also an opposing spirit in the world</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.923" end="02:15:13.790" style="s2"> An anti-purpose brother</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.988" end="02:15:15.209" style="s2"> Like Cain did to Abel</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.209" end="02:15:16.880" style="s2"> We will talk about this next week</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.255" end="02:15:18.738" style="s2"> It&#39;s all against you</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.072" end="02:15:22.756" style="s2"> This opposing spirit is completely</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.756" end="02:15:25.126" style="s2"> Driven by evil beliefs and desire for destruction</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.481" end="02:15:28.017" style="s2"> It has a reason to act</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.878" end="02:15:33.571" style="s2"> This is the content of the next story</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.571" end="02:15:35.429" style="s2"> The story of Cain and Abel is in a paragraph</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.326" end="02:15:38.435" style="s2"> Except for the weird claims of Christian mystics</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.435" end="02:15:41.702" style="s2"> This opposing spirit began to appear for the first time</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.702" end="02:15:44.928" style="s2"> It and the serpent of eden</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.032" end="02:15:47.527" style="s2"> Have identity with the initiator of all evil</p>
