 The Psychological Significance of the Story of the Bible, Lecture 4 Adam and Eve-Self-awareness of Evil and Death by Jordan B. Peterson
 Hello everyone
 Hope we can today
 Finish the content of the first chapter of "Genesis"
 That's probably what I planned
 I finished my new book yesterday
 It took me three years to finish this book
 It’s a long time for writing
 In short, it's finished
 There is still the final finishing work
 Some copy editing, etc. Hope it will go smoothly
 I have done my best
 I don’t know if it’s perfect
 But I have tried my best anyway
 Then next
 Is the story i want to tell tonight
 I keep thinking about this story just like last week
 I've been thinking about the question last week for a long time
 But this week’s will be longer
 There is one thing I can't understand
 I can’t understand why in such a short story
 Contains so much information
 Especially the story of Cain and Abel
 Whenever i read this story
 I am always at a loss because
 Because this story is only a short paragraph
 Has no meaning
 I think about it repeatedly
 Whenever i think about it
 I have a new understanding of this story
 I can't understand why this happens
 When I describe to you
 The reasonable way is based on this point of view
 That is, there is some wisdom in these stories
 These wisdoms are generated from our interpersonal communication and behavior
 Then show it on the image
 They are in the long history
 It is continuously condensed into clear text
 And then for a long time
 Repeated memory and transmission
 Keep being refined
 This is a good argument
 I am happy to continue in this direction
 But it keeps admiring me
 There is so much information in such a short article
 So we have to analyze it today
 I think the story of Cain and Abel is especially true
 Because it not only works at the individual level
 It has also been confirmed at the family and political levels
 Even at war
 And economically applicable
 It covers too much for one essential story
 You may have to refute but such a story
 You never know what you are reading
 Don't know what this story means
 This is part of the so-called "postmodern dilemma"
 This question is reasonable
 This question really can't find an answer like you can't
 State exactly how you understand the world
 Not completely correct but it is enough
 One answer says
 "Enough" means it is executable
 Nobody else strongly disagrees you won't die because of it
 And nature will not limit you
 The limitations in our lives
 You can be certain of your understanding to some extent
 At least functionally feasible
 This is very important
 I guess you might want to explain these stories
 Apply the same conditions
 It may be good for now
 But I hope you can be on multiple levels
 Find functionally important explanations
 But I think it might be very small
 It’s like finding one at multiple levels at the same time
 Applicable story interpretation
 Then apply one more level
 You stumbled upon a certain
 The probability of accidental events will decrease, right?
 There is a technical term in psychology
 It seems to be called multiple traits and multiple methods
 Is a way to define whether something is accurate
 Its idea is
 The more methods you use to get the same result
 The more you can be sure that you are not
 Use your prior assumptions to deceive yourself
 But in fact it is
 I guess this is another part of this method
 This is also a method I used in my speech
 I will not try to tell people any
 Things that are not personal
 Because you should know why you should teach you something
 You should know what is good
 It is personally good for you at least in a sense
 And when you use it
 It should be good for your family
 Maybe it should be important in a wider social group
 I think this is the so-called "meaning"
 I don’t think the fact that being taught lacks meaning
 is useful
 Because the facts are infinite
 And you can't remember them all
 They must have substantial instrumental meaning
 Because we are creatures that use tools
 These stories happen to have these aspects
 as far as I know
 There is no doubt about this
 These are the stories in the second chapter of "Genesis"
 These stories are very famous
 In fact, everyone is immersed in
 Generally speaking, people in Western culture should have heard these stories
 This is also a very interesting point
 That the story can be so based
 So that everyone has heard
 You can also say
 So are many fairy tales
 Or until now you can at least assume so
 But I think the foundation of the story
 It also means that they must be given
 Even if you don’t respect them, you will at least
 Treat them as extraordinary curiosity
 So why are these stories
 Why are they passed down
 Why everyone has heard
 These questions cannot be answered with imagination
 You can try to use Freud's explanation
 Freud believed that Judaism and Christianity
 Is based on the following viewpoints
 The father in the family sense
 Is extended to the dimension of the universe
 And human beings have the same relationship with the Father of the universe
 Just like the same baby or child
 Relationship with father
 I think this is a reasonable conclusion to some extent
 But it does seem to Freud to be intentional
 Does mean and not only
 Belief that has at its apex
 Anthropomorphic religious people
 It's basically playing a role as a child under care
 I have been thinking about this argument for a long time
 Believe me this is a strong argument
 In Ernest Becker’s "Death Denial"
 This is one of the best books I have ever read
 Just adopted the above argument
 And like the others I’ve seen discussing this argument
 The book has expanded
 Becker tried to give Freud
 Ending the psychoanalysis of religion
 But he didn't do well
 However, although I think this book is full of shortcomings and errors
 But the flaws are not hiding
 Some books are wrong but they are valuable
 These books provide strong arguments
 And take it to the extreme
 But I think Becker ignored Jung’s point of view
 It's as if Freud also ignored
 Becker who wrote this book from the perspective of religious psychoanalysis
 Never quote Jung’s views
 Just mentioned in the introduction
 I think this is the main mistake Becker made
 But Becker adopted an argument
 That is, the hypothesis about God is just a human attempt
 Attempt to recreate an infant-like dependent state
 To be able to rely on an omniscient priest
 Maybe it’s to get back a comfortable feeling
 This feeling is what we experienced when we were young
 There is a father who seems to us to know everything
 Or lucky enough
 Have people who can bring similar feelings
 The more I think about this, the more shocked I am
 I always think it's impossible
 I remember Charles Taylor
 I wrote a book called
 I remember it was called "The Urgency of the Modern Self"
 He is a philosopher of McGill school
 I would not say that he is a fan of classic religion
 But it doesn't matter
 Because he alone made a very interesting point about Christianity
 He believes that if a religion is invented
 It can only provide you with the comfort of infancy
 Then why do you bother to imagine hell
 This seems to be an unnecessary detail in the whole story
 If religion is all about comfort
 So why should people assume
 The consequences of serious mistakes will be endless torture
 It doesn't feel like
 Something that makes you feel comfortable
 When James Joyce wrote this
 Talking about his very bad nightmares when he was a kid
 It comes from the preaching process of the Jesuit priest
 The raging fire in the hell mentioned
 He also wrote down what he remembered
 The content is creepy
 In James Joyce's book
 I remember it was called "A Portrait of a Young Artist"
 The book talks about the Jesuit priest telling him
 Hell is like a prison wall seven miles deep
 Dark and dark
 People locked there
 Will always be burned by the flames in the dark
 Above the flames, their bodies are constantly growing
 Provide fuel for eternal hellfire
 This is what everyone can't figure out
 The reason why the fire of purgatory can never burn
 This is the obvious process
 I don’t think this shows the satisfaction of my childhood wishes
 You may doubt it
 Elaine Pagles who wrote a book about the devil
 Is skeptical of this approach
 She thinks it can be said to be a Christian
 Invented hell as a place to place enemies
 Ok this seems to make sense
 But this is obviously inaccurate
 Although there is a convenient place to put your enemies
 For example, Charles Taylor clearly pointed out
 The modern fear of losing yourself
 Or the loss of self-existence and meaning
 May be roughly similar to the fear of hell in the Middle Ages
 In terms of existential strength
 Hell is not only a
 Where the people you don't care about end up
 it's a
 Where to go if you don't follow the rules
 So I don’t think Freud’s view
 Can stand up in the final analysis
 Marx’s view is that religion is like the opium of the masses
 He made a point similar to Freud
 Just a little earlier
 His view is based on the following assumptions
 That is, religious belief is just a story for the vulnerable group
 The purpose is to appease them
 Such malicious exploiters
 Can continue to exploit and weaken their power
 I think "human institutions are
 The view of "fully driven by power"
 There is a problem to say the least
 Of course every human organization will
 Corrupt for various reasons
 Also because it's especially like cheating
 Corrupt by arrogantly coveting power
 The religious system is not exempt
 But this does not mean
 They can be on these defects
 Show some distinctive characteristics
 Maybe you think they can
 Maybe you can find a convincing reason for it
 But you can’t say that this is generally obvious from preliminary proof
 Treat it as a particularly useful criticism
 I can't agree
 I think people who hold this view are too suspicious
 I think for the people who write these stories
 First of all, what do you plan to do
 You guys want to successfully plan one
 A stunning conspiracy that lasted 3000 years?
 Good luck then
 You can't even plan a plot that lasts a quarter of an hour
 Without being cast aside by everyone
 This is impossible
 No matter what the foundation of the architecture is
 Not only the basis of these stories
 And the dogmatic structure that emerged on this basis
 I think only a single dimension of explanation is used to summarize them
 Really wrong
 In fact I always think
 Any behavior that reduces complex human performance to a single dimension
 Are only done by single-minded thinkers
 I said this after careful consideration
 Because Freud treated religion the same way
 At least to some extent
 Freud is a rigorous thinker
 I think Marx is also a rigorous thinker
 Even though he
 Ok
 He is a
 As long as you have a sense of reason
 You will be dumbfounded at Marx
 Anyway what I want to say is I don’t think
 Can any simple explanation
 Can explain why these stories are so powerful
 I don’t think you can reduce it to a political conspiracy
 There is no doubt about this
 I don’t think you can reduce it to mental naivety
 I think you can think of them like me
 A treasure trove of human collective wisdom
 I received an interesting letter this week
 I have many interesting letters
 I think I can put them in order
 And put it on the website some time
 Of course you have to get their permission
 The letter said he has been listening to my lectures
 And noticed that I was looking for a
 What can be called quasi-organism or evolutionary reason
 Used to study the generation of information contained in the story
 He also said, "How do you know people of different religions
 "Or people with different religious traditions
 "Won't do exactly the same thing"
 I think first
 It is possible to some extent
 Because their religions overlap
 For example, some things I talked about about Taoism
 Taoism treats being as
 Balance between eternal chaos and order
 One thing I didn’t mention I didn’t think about
 I don't know if you know
 There is a neuropsychologist named Eknane Goldberg
 He is a student of Alexander Lulia
 I think Lulia
 Is the greatest neuropsychologist of the 20th century
 He is russian
 He was the first group to be truly sure in general
 One of the functional people of the prefrontal cortex
 Its function has been a mystery for a long time
 Speaking of Goldberg, everyone knows that the human brain has two hemispheres
 Left brain and right brain
 People usually think that the left brain is for right-handed people
 Especially right-handed men
 Because women's neurological functions are more scattered
 This makes women more able to withstand brain damage
 Maybe the male brain function is more concentrated
 This makes the male brain function more specialized
 But more vulnerable
 Closer to home, the human brain has two hemispheres left and right
 But no one knows why
 We know that the left and right brains each have a similar consciousness
 If you separate the corpus callosum connecting the left and right brains
 For example, to treat certain cases of intractable epilepsy
 Every hemisphere can to some extent
 Develop their own consciousness independently
 The right brain is usually nonverbal while the left brain is verbal
 So there is a view that the left brain is a language hemisphere
 The right brain is a nonverbal hemisphere
 But this is not right because obviously animals can’t speak
 But animals also have separate brain hemispheres
 So even if it is true
 Causally has nothing to do with language
 Goldberg proposed another hypothesis
 That is, the left and right brains are respectively specialized in routine and unconventional activities
 Or rather novel and familiar with chaos and order
 This is really a bold idea
 When i first heard this
 I also treat it as a signal
 A so-called
 The verification signal of the structure of the multiple characteristics and multiple methods
 Because i never thought about it
 The brain hemisphere will behave in this way
 And Goldberg put forward this point in the course of history
 This view and any thinking inspired by myth
 All completely different
 Lack of relevance
 In fact it is more subject to materialism
 The advancement of Russian neuropsychology
 The subject is classified as materialism for political reasons
 There are also scientific reasons
 But the core point is that one hemisphere of the human brain
 Can react quickly to things we are not familiar with
 This hemisphere is more imaginative and more distributed
 And it’s more related to negative emotions
 Because negative emotions can be perceived immediately
 When you encounter something you don’t understand
 Negative emotions are actually a way of thinking
 I'm in a state of not knowing how things are going
 The right brain will remind you
 Then the right brain will quickly generate video
 To help you figure out what's in front of you
 Then the left brain takes over
 Use this thing more clearly
 The rigorous explanation allows you to fully understand
 So there is a dynamic balance between the left and right hemispheres
 The left brain tries to establish the order of the world
 Ramachandran
 A very famous neuroscientist in California
 Also developed a theory similar to Goldberg
 He believes that the left brain has established a regular order of the world
 The right brain is responsible for creating novelty
 React to new things and generate novel hypotheses
 He believes that with the support of existing good evidence
 What happens in my sleep is exactly
 Right brain to left brain
 Little by little transmission of information
 Such a novel revelation for the right brain
 So as not to damage the left brain carefully built
 Rigorous structural order
 I also like this theory
 Because it also helps to prove
 The hypothesis I have been expounding for you
 That is, a part of our individual extends self to the whole world
 And trying to understand things we don’t understand
 That part extends itself to behavior
 Emotions and video
 Possibly also poetry and narrative
 With the development process
 We have developed more and more
 Clear expression of emerging knowledge
 So you can map it to neurologists in a good place
 About the neuropsychologist
 What constitutes the presumption of brain hemisphere differentiation
 One more cool thing
 Demonstration about the differentiation of brain hemispheres
 As far as I know, it’s worth thinking about
 Because it's too
 Ned Flanders used one word to describe
 "Staggering"
 I think it probably means this haha
 Anyway we do assume
 We are biologically adapted to reality
 If you are a darwinist
 This is actually an axiomatic definition
 Because by definition natural selection
 This is the natural survival of the fittest
 If natural selection of species with separate brain hemispheres
 Because half of you need to deal with chaos
 The other half of you need to maintain order
 So you can draw conclusions that can stand scrutiny
 The world is born out of chaos and order
 This is something worth thinking about
 if you are willing to
 You can take some time to think about it
 To blame for some reason
 These stories cover a lot of content
 We continue to study some
 Let’s start with the story of Adam and Eve
 You may remember that the Bible is a series of books
 The Bible is actually like a library
 These books are written by different people
 Edited by different people
 Edited countless times in the long river of history
 Not by someone alone, but by a hundred schools of thought
 For a long time there was a default tradition that
 The first book that appeared was written by Moses
 To be honest, this may be incorrect
 Although it may be correct from a dramatic point of view
 Or it is "fairy-tale correctness"
 I don't mean to belittle fairy tales
 These authors
 For now, the way to identify these authors is
 Identify certain stylistic characteristics in different stories
 Use of words
 Such as the term "God"
 Different poetry styles, different themes, etc.
 People spent almost 200 years
 Trying to figure out who wrote which article
 How did these stories piece together
 This is not important for our purposes
 The important thing is that it is a collection of collective narrative traditions
 Or a collection of collective narrative wisdom
 We can not discuss it so deeply
 But at least we can say that it is a collection of narrative traditions
 These traditions are kept and others are abandoned
 There is a reason
 The stories are arranged in a specific order
 There are also complicated reasons
 The Bible as literature
 The very good point is
 It’s really plot-like.
 It involves many levels
 But it has been in thousands of years
 Pieced together by people
 Maybe 4000 years maybe longer
 If you count the previous oral tradition period
 God knows how long
 Part of human collective imagination
 Put together a library with a storyline
 I see the Bible as
 A collective attempt by mankind to solve the most profound problems
 I think these are questions about self-awareness
 About us are not immortal
 The fact that we are going to die and know it well
 This is a unique dilemma for mankind
 Distinguish us from everything
 This is shown in the story of Adam and Eve
 I think what makes us so unique
 Shown in the story of Adam and Eve
 Interestingly
 I realize this is
 After finishing the previous three lectures
 The Bible describes the great changes at the beginning of time
 This great change has given mankind a sense of self
 Cracks in the structure of existence
 This is the correct way to understand
 This has cosmic significance
 You can refute
 Events that happen to humans
 Won't have cosmic meaning
 We are just a fleeting dog-like entity
 Living here like a cancer
 Sojourn in the vast sky
 In the corner of an unknown galaxy
 Rotating on a little planet
 Everything that happens to us is meaningless
 You can stick to this point of view
 I would not recommend you to do this
 Part of the reason is
 This is untrue for whatever purpose
 You can't live well with such thoughts
 In fact, if you really insist on this idea
 If you really think so
 You may lose your life in the end
 This really reminds me
 I have talked to many people with serious suicidal tendencies
 Before they give birth to the idea of ​​ending their lives
 Their conclusions about the utility of life
 And you stick to the conclusion of that idea
 Are highly similar
 If you are interested
 You can read Leo Tolstoy's "Confessions"
 This is a short and powerful book
 Tolstoy described his time in the heyday of fame
 Desire for suicide
 The most famous author in the world
 High-ranking households are world-renowned
 We are admired by thousands of people
 He has everything you can imagine
 He didn't dare to walk into the barn with a rope or gun
 He was afraid he would hang himself or shoot himself
 He finally came out of the shadows
 And what he experienced
 This is a very good book
 The "Bible" story beginning with Adam and Eve
 Tells a different story
 They bring the emergence of human self-consciousness
 Considered as a cosmic change event
 You might ask
 What do we have to do with the universe
 the answer is
 Depends on what you think is the relationship between consciousness and the universe
 Maybe it has nothing to do
 I will choose closely related
 Because in my opinion
 Of course you can disagree
 But if you think
 Consciousness is a force with universal meaning
 Being itself depends on any real meaning
 At least on any empirical meaning
 Then the following assumptions are reasonable
 That is, the complete reconstruction of consciousness can be given
 Some kind of cosmic or metaphysical meaning
 Even from a perspective other than human
 It is still incorrect
 Whatever it means
 It is real from a human perspective
 It's certain
 In a sense this is the first event since the creation of the world
 Catastrophic fall
 The rest of the Bible
 Are trying to figure out how to deal with it
 For example, in the Old Testament story
 What happened next was the establishment of the State of Israel
 Then rise and fall
 Then people started
 Hundreds or even thousands of years of exploration
 Follow this point of view
 In the tragic result of self-consciousness
 Ways to protect yourself
 Is dedicated to the country
 But it turned out that the country itself began to show morbidity
 When these illnesses start to accumulate
 The country began to fall apart
 Then rise again and rebirth
 It collapses and rebirth repeatedly
 So many cycles
 This mainly comes from the explanation of Northrop Frye
 This mainly comes from the explanation of Northrop Frye
 People began to think "the country is the place of salvation"
 Is this idea wrong?
 Is this idea flawed?
 On this basis
 There was a Christian revolution
 And such a hypothesis
 "The country is not a place of salvation"
 The individual's mind is
 And correspondingly appeared the ethical system
 It's also very interesting
 The ethics of salvation after the failure of the “state experiment” is
 "Salvation is presented in the mind of the individual"
 Even in terms of country
 Because of the normal operation of the country
 Depends on the normal operation of the individual
 Fundamentally and not the other way around
 The correct way to redeem individuals is truth
 The truth is in the story of Adam and Eve
 The antidote to the suffering caused by the fall of man
 This echoes the chapter we discussed earlier
 There is a claim in the first chapter of Genesis
 Is the way of truth to create order in chaos
 But more importantly
 This is also when I gave the lecture three weeks before
 Just realized
 When God uses truth to introduce order into existence
 He kept saying
 The being that he introduced into being is good
 Have such a proposition
 Beings that introduce beings through truth are good
 The interesting thing is at the beginning of the story
 Have such a hint
 It’s about the state of being enshrined in Adam and Eve
 Before they fell and gained self-awareness
 They were created in the image of God
 And revealed the following truths
 That is, "the existence itself is reasonably balanced"
 The entire Bible is a re-exploration of this view
 This is a trace to the origin
 This is a classic mythological theme
 Wise people are
 The person who regained what was lost in childhood
 I think this is a Jewish concept
 If I remember correctly
 Is a messianic character
 Is the one who regained what was lost in childhood
 There is back to the original concept
 But you are not falling back to childhood and unconsciousness
 But you return to your childhood fully awake and spontaneously
 Then decided to pass the truth
 To participate in the presentation of reasonable beings
 I study psychology
 I have been teaching personality theory for a long time
 I have a deep understanding of personality theory
 I also know something about philosophy
 Although I don’t know enough
 But what i can tell you is
 In all the theories that I have read and encountered
 I have never seen any theory so profound
 Not only profound but also credible
 As a clinician, I also observed
 I think this is unique to clinical experience
 And was accurately described by outstanding clinicians
 "It is the truth that can heal the pain in treatment."
 The truth is the cure
 There are clinical exposure treatments for what you fear
 There are also escape treatments
 But I think this is a form of practicing the truth
 If you know what you need to do according to your own standards
 But avoid doing it
 Then you are practicing lies
 You did not verbally lie
 You are practicing lies with actions
 No different at all
 So if I can let you face
 Things you know you shouldn't avoid
 We are all involved
 The process of trying to make you show the deepest truth
 This can improve people's lives
 Can completely improve their lives
 Numerous clinical evidence
 We know if you expose people to
 They are afraid and in front of things they avoid
 They can overcome it slowly
 You have to be careful
 Involve them in the process
 But there is one point in all the theories established by clinicians
 This is first of all credible
 Based on deeper consciousness
 That is, clinical experience is redeemable
 It aims to solve the pain
 Because the people involved in this process
 Are telling the truth
 You will think this is obvious
 Because when you have a problem and come to talk to me
 First when you come to talk to me
 You acknowledged the problem
 This is a good start
 Second, if you talk to me
 We know the problem
 If we know the problem
 We can start to list some solutions
 Then you can put it into practice to see if these methods are effective
 But if you don’t admit the problem
 Refused to tell me what the problem was
 And I'm pretending to be mysterious
 Always dominate the conversation
 What's the use
 We are immersed in delusion
 Maybe this will bring short-term comfort
 But it is useless
 If you think about it, it's obvious
 Freud believed that depression is the core of mental pain
 Repression and deception are only the difference in degree
 Nothing more
 Is the difference in degree
 Alfred Adler
 Is one of Freud’s best colleagues
 I think he is underestimated
 He thinks people are in trouble
 Because of practicing the "life lie"
 He put forward the "life lie"
 This is worth studying
 Because Adler is not as attractive as Freud
 But he is very practical
 He did foresee the development of cybernetics
 Jung thinks you can
 Only by making appropriate moral efforts in life
 You can ignore psychotherapy completely
 Carl Rogers thinks
 Candid communication through dialogue
 Can produce salvation results
 Behaviouralists believe that micro-analysis of the problems before them
 And then lead people to face the things they avoid
 All of this seems to me just
 The secular variant of "the truth will set you free"
 This is a very powerful story
 First of all, this story is not easy to ignore
 Secondly, if you ignore it, you are actually taking a risk
 I have seen people who have been deeply hurt
 Mostly hurt by deception
 This is worth thinking about
 Life will hit you head on
 There is no doubt about this
 But I thought for a long time
 People can withstand earthquakes, cancer and even death
 But they can't bear betrayal and can't bear cheating
 They can't bear someone trusted by the one they love
 Deception and betrayal
 This will destroy them
 It makes them sick and painful
 Cause psychological and physical trauma
 Not only that
 Betrayal will make them
 Cynical, bitter, vicious and resentful
 They also started to do evil to the world, forming a vicious circle
 At the beginning of the story
 God uses truth to create good beings
 Then the disaster happened
 Mankind spent thousands of years
 Trying to figure out how to deal with this catastrophe
 The fact that they have self-awareness
 We are indeed self-conscious
 Other animals have no such consciousness
 You will read about chimpanzees as an example
 If you put lipstick on chimps
 This is a strange thing
 I don't want to repeat it
 If you show chimps in the mirror
 It will wipe off the lipstick
 Dolphins seem to be able to distinguish themselves in the mirror
 There is a budding of self-consciousness in other animals
 But put it in the concept of human self-consciousness
 I think
 At least it is not yet formed
 But I also think it is caused by
 Driven by a potential anti-humanist drive
 Human self-awareness has developed very well
 The self-awareness of animals is totally different
 It’s like when the vervet monkey spotted the predator
 Warning call
 Compared with human language
 There are indeed similarities between the two
 Animal calls are also meaningful
 But the call is not language
 The self-consciousness of animals is the original self-consciousness
 There are few self-aware animals
 Incomparable with humans
 They have no idea of ​​the future
 They don’t know their limitations in time and space
 this is very important
 Especially time
 Humans "discovered" time
 When we "discovered" time
 We have discovered the end of each of our beings
 This distinguishes us from animals
 This is the connotation of the story of Adam and Eve
 The first chapter of "Genesis" is from the priest's literature
 God is called in priest literature
 "Ilohim" or "Ilshade"
 There are singular gods and plural gods
 I think the reason is
 If you analyze the history of monotheism
 Monotheism actually developed from polytheism
 As i said before
 I think the gods represent the fundamental power
 These fundamental forces must be organized in hierarchy
 Must have authority
 Otherwise they can only conflict with each other and achieve nothing
 Value must be organized in levels
 Or just one
 Whether it's for the individual
 Still for the country
 If you don’t know what to do next
 You do it all blindly
 This is doomed to nothing
 You have to sort out the priority
 One thing always takes precedence over others
 Arrange according to the hierarchy to avoid chaos
 So the rules of hierarchy appeared in the gods
 Maybe there is still a long run-in
 The battle of the gods described by Mircea Iliad
 If interested
 You can read "History of Religious Thought"
 I recommend you to read
 This book has three volumes
 Relatively easy to understand
 For religious books
 Eliade developed polytheism to monotheism
 The process and reasons are explained clearly
 Even in polytheism
 The gods are also very inclined to build their own hierarchy
 And promoted a supreme god in power
 In a sense
 Except for the most powerful god
 The other gods are gone with time
 But even in the polytheistic essay
 There is also a hierarchy of power among the gods
 The first chapter of "Genesis" is newer than the second chapter
 The story I want to parse today
 Longer than the one I said before
 Although their order was reversed by the editor
 This editor is hypothetical
 Maybe a group of editors
 They collected these stories
 I think it’s unlikely that there is only one person who knows
 We still don’t know why these stories
 Are arranged in this order
 But we can infer this arrangement order
 Is a reasonable order considered by the editor
 This is the editor’s job
 Edited different ideas
 Arrange in a reasonable order
 Reasonable order means
 You can tell people these thoughts
 Keep them interested
 And let them remember these points
 This is also one of the reasonable standards for determining your argument
 Because your argument is communicable, understandable and memorable
 We can say it is driven by intuition
 This person arranges these stories in this order
 The Jehovah Document contains
 The classic story of the Torah
 "Genesis" "Exodus" "Leviticus"
 "Numbers" "Deuteronomy"
 I hope that in these 12 lectures we can all talk about
 Let's watch while walking
 There are many personifications in the Jehovah literature
 So the God in Jehovah’s documents
 In a sense, it’s a "yuan man"
 I read a little bit last week
 People tend to think this is imperfect
 But you think so
 Mind is the foundation of consciousness
 Is the most complicated thing we know
 Then imagine this most complicated thing like this
 Not so perfect
 At least this is people's exhaustion of imagination
 The best result you can get
 So i don't think it is imperfect
 It can be inferred from this
 Very practically
 The following ideas are also very reasonable
 That the Father is from
 The spirit that rises from the crowd and continues into the future
 When we discuss the concept of sacrifice
 Involved some
 Or we will talk about this later
 You will sacrifice the present
 Let yourself be more satisfied in the future
 But the problem is
 What kind of future will satisfy you
 The answer is the spirit of all mankind
 This is what you negotiate
 You can make an assumption
 If you sacrifice willful play
 Go all out to get a medical degree
 Ten years later when you become a doctor
 Human society will respect your dedication and commitment
 And open the door to you
 You not only treat the future as an independent being
 Treat it as a compassionate judge
 You are putting it into practice
 Maybe before we start to understand that there is a future
 You have to imagine God as an ununderstood form
 Maybe think of God as such a form
 We can make things concrete and deal with them
 We can learn how to use sacrifice
 To understand how to guide us into the future
 Sacrifice is a contract with the future
 Not a contract with a specific person
 Is a contract with all mankind
 When you think in this way
 It will give you an initiation
 Because this is a great idea
 Allows you to bargain with the future
 This idea is amazing
 It’s the most important idea for us as human beings
 What to do if we suffer
 We have to figure out how to discuss with the future
 And use this method to minimize our suffering
 No other animal can do it
 The lion only has what to eat
 A wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat
 Eat as long as there is meat
 I won’t say save some mammoth for tomorrow.
 Wolves won’t do this, but humans will
 That means you may be starving today
 Imagine you are a farmer 6000 years ago
 At the beginning of the farming civilization, you were about to starve to death
 Looking forward to spring ploughing
 You know you better not touch those seeds
 This ability is very important to control the present self
 Let the future come true
 And postpone what you can enjoy now
 Instead of using it on impulse
 Maybe your child is starving to death
 You still can’t touch the seeds you will use in the future
 For mankind to realize that there is a future
 And the ability to plan for the future
 This is too important i think
 In fact, at least part of the story in the book is
 Describes the birth process of this ability
 Jehovah's documentation begins in chapter 2 section 4 of Genesis
 "This is how the world was created" (Genesis 2:4)
 There are two true creation stories at the beginning
 The later one is the first one
 The longer one is the second
 The Jiuyuan Edition starts with Chapter 2 of Genesis
 Which is what we are going to talk about next
 Including Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel
 Noah Babel
 Chapters in Jehovah's Documents
 "Exodus" "Numbers"
 There are also some priest documents
 The Ten Commandments are also included
 There are many vivid descriptions of heaven
 This is "The Paradise on Earth"
 I forgot what the author was called
 Boss
 To Jeronimos Boss
 A madman
 I can't understand why he was not burned to death on the stake
 Most of you know Salvador Dali
 He is insignificant compared to Boss
 You might spend a whole month
 Observe this painting with a weird and outrageous feeling
 I don't know what happened to Boss
 But he is the kind of creature that only appears once in history
 This may be a good thing
 There have always been many expressions about heaven
 God knows what heaven means in this painting
 I can only guess at best but I won’t do that
 There is a lion lying among the sheep
 Here is such a concept
 Reflects the past
 Or maybe at some point in the future
 Fear of survival
 There is no need for life itself
 And the scary thing about life is of course
 It's the eclipse of everything
 All things perish and all things are reborn
 The whole land is a morgue
 Full of disasters from beginning to end
 This fantasy is the exact opposite of the previous one
 Have a very deep thought
 This idea is also implicit in one of the alchemy ideas
 I think it is also one of the ideas implicit in the scientific revolution
 Interact with reality with this thought
 Humans can reduce tragedy and depravity
 To be able to
 This is obviously imagist
 Maybe we can get closer to the place transformed by this thought
 Where we enjoy the benefits of actual existence
 Without any disaster
 When Jung wrote that science begins with alchemy
 He believes that science is driven by dreams
 For Jung, dream is the embodiment of instinct
 It exists at the boundary between instinct and mind
 Science is embedded in dreams
 Dream is some kind
 If we are fully focused and sincere
 To observe the structure of physical reality
 Can understand material reality and reduce suffering
 Stone of the Sage
 Make everyone rich and make everyone healthy
 Something that makes everyone immortal
 This is the ultimate goal to alleviate existing disasters
 Solutions to the mystery of life
 May let us find such a theme
 Or put it this way
 To provide the driving force for the development of science
 Jung put the power of development
 Going back more than 1,000 years ago
 If you are interested in reading his book about alchemy
 Those books are extremely difficult to understand
 It also confirms the profound knowledge of Jung
 Because his books are hard to read
 It can be said that books on alchemy have taken a quantum leap
 That seems to be a "small" leap
 I shouldn't say that
 It should be said that these books have taken a big step
 Stepped into a completely different complex latitude
 But this is also the latitude Jung tried to step into
 He reinterpreted alchemy literature
 As if they are dreams established by science
 By the way, Newton was also an alchemist
 The hypothesis put forward by Jung is well confirmed by history
 The birth of science really began with alchemy
 The question is what does alchemy do
 They try to refine the sage stone
 This is also the panacea pursued by human pathology
 Jung felt that what happened was
 Christianity promised to stop suffering
 Said it for more than 1,000 years
 The pain has not been abated yet
 Simultaneously
 Christianity tried to really value spiritual construction
 For example, at the expense of material development
 Treat it as something similar to sin
 Try to restrain impulse
 All of these are accompanied by the existence of a twin
 There is a reason
 European minds around 1000 AD
 Got some education
 And be able to focus on a single point
 Maybe because of long and intensive religious training
 Pull down religious dreams from the unexplored material world
 Europeans think about it then
 The spiritual salvation we have been pursuing
 Does not seem to make promises and expected results
 Achieved
 Maybe we should seek answers in another place
 And the answer lies in the cursed world of material desire
 that place
 At least based on the traditional perspective
 Just a place to create demons
 What i want to say is
 People have many motivations, it’s hard to underestimate their number
 These motives are deeply rooted in people's attempts to relieve pain
 People try to eradicate the disease
 Help others lead a healthy life
 Reduce disease health and longevity
 Do things in a peaceful manner as much as possible
 You can say that the world does not speak morality, justice and self-interest
 You can also say that they are all driven by power
 Corruption
 All these things are right
 But you shouldn’t totally deny human beings for this flaw
 Because we worked hard for a long time to get things right
 What we have achieved today is already very good
 For our half-hungry state of madness
 Insect-ridden
 And for chimpanzees with a life span of only 50 to 70 years
 For the status of human beings today
 We deserve a little sympathy
 What you want me to say
 Some other explanations about heaven
 I like this picture
 This one on the left
 Heaven is a garden in a trap
 The meaning of heaven is the same
 From the word "parádeisos" it is
 Don't remember what language it is
 Anyway related to Persian
 "Parádeisos" means garden
 Why is it a garden?
 We have to go back to the concept of chaos and order
 After creation
 God put men and women in the garden
 Entrapment means culture and order, garden means nature
 Illustrates a place suitable for human habitation
 Is a place where nature and civilization strike a balance
 We like the garden why
 Because the garden is not completely covered by weeds and mosquitoes
 Covered by flies, right
 So the garden is more or less civilized
 But in this civilization
 Nature thrives with a more kind and benevolent attitude
 People think this idea is full of life
 I feel "Heaven, a livable place for humans
 "It's a garden" This idea is good
 There is a wall because you want to block something out
 For example raccoon
 You want to keep it out even if it’s impossible
 There must be various things
 You don’t want them to appear in the garden like snakes
 If you want to come in, the wall doesn't seem to be able to stop
 But the idea that "heaven is a garden"
 Echoes the concept of chaos and order at the beginning
 The wall is the civilized garden is the nature
 The ideal human habitat is like a well-tended garden
 Radical leftist anti-theist environmentalist
 Tend to prove
 The plunder of Western capitalism is actually
 The consequences of humans following an instruction
 In "Genesis", God gave mankind
 The command is to go out and dominate the world
 David Suzuki also talked a lot about it
 They believe this statement makes
 We wished
 The right to control the world
 This statement turned humans into terrible carnivorous monsters
 Sometimes humans are described as tumors on the surface of the earth
 Or viruses that parasitize the entire ecosystem
 Not only did not build on the earth, but also wandered around all day
 Mess everywhere
 This is another perspective on human nature
 But I think it must be strongly condemned
 If you look at the history
 You will find
 By the end of the 19th century Thomas Huxley
 Grandpa of Aldous Huxley
 Darwin's big supporter
 Wrote a report to the British government for the sustainability of the ocean
 The conclusion he gave is to fish as much as you like
 There are thousands of fish in the ocean
 The resources of the ocean are inexhaustible
 No matter how many years humans try their best to take
 Have an impact on marine ecology
 The possibility can only be zero
 Now things prove Huxley wrong
 He didn't expect that the population would surge like a magic
 Part of the reason is that we have become richer
 The newborn will never be like before
 The infant mortality rate is as high as 60% before reaching their first birthday
 Even if only a few people
 We can thrive
 We only realized in the 1960s
 We have too much population
 Must start paying attention
 What we do to the earth
 This is 50 years ago
 We just started to develop technology
 And the necessary technology
 To understand that the whole world should be considered a garden
 We have to find the balance between civilization and chaos inside
 before this
 We just tried our best to survive
 And usually fail
 So I don’t agree with this interpretation of the beginning of "Genesis"
 I do not believe
 Human beings are empowered on this planet
 To act as a super predator
 On the contrary I think
 Compare the garden to a suitable habitat for humans
 Is quite appropriate
 People's role
 It is also clearly stated in the second story
 Adam and Eve are looking after the garden
 Illustrate the appropriate choice
 Let everything thrive and thrive
 Not only good for other creatures
 Good for humans too
 I think now we at least
 Can notice what is commonly proposed today
 Compared to the final cynical interpretation of this story
 This is just a slightly different angle of interpretation of the story
 There are several trees in the garden
 There are Adam and Eve, some animals and so on
 Unfortunately this tree happened to be entangled by a snake
 This is interesting
 Next we will have a lot of discussion about this
 Snakes are unusual in both pictures
 It has a human head
 The one in the other picture also has a human head
 No matter what kind of snake it is
 Don’t look at it from a religious perspective
 If you can't do it, imagine you are a anthropologist
 You have never seen this painting
 What do you see at this moment
 You see the wall and a very comfortable enclosed space
 Then you see a tree
 People are eating from the tree
 There is a snake with a human head on the tree
 You might wonder why this snake has a human head
 Then you will think
 This is half snake and half human
 This hardly reveals anything
 It speaks for itself
 So no matter what it is
 Anyway, it's not just a snake
 It is a snake and a human
 Or a snake but some of the characteristics of a human
 This is very important we will analyze next
 Here you see the same thing
 In this picture you can see
 There is a head there
 This snake has two wings
 This is a snake with wings a bit like a dragon
 Can crawl on the ground like a reptile
 It has a flying animal side or a spiritual side
 This snake is like the lowest form of reptile life
 Is something crawling on the ground
 It's a human body and a spirit body
 It perches on this tree
 This tree looks a lot like hallucinogenic mushrooms by the way
 If you want to know, you can check
 This theme is also unique
 If you are curious about it
 But there is another thought here
 That is, there was such a thing in the garden at the beginning of time
 This thing is like a snake and a person
 This thing has wings and spirituality
 So it is a combination of spiritual humans and reptiles
 It is also the vivid spirit of this tree
 Well remember this
 "Heaven and earth are made" (Genesis 2:1)
 This is related to the first chapter of "Genesis"
 "All things are made together" (Genesis 2:1)
 "By the seventh day
 "Just stopped all his work on the seventh day
 "Rest in peace
 "God bless the seventh day
 "Sacred Day
 "Because on this day God stopped all the work of creation
 "Rest in peace" (Gen 2:3)
 The concept of the Sabbath is wisdom
 I have worked with a lot of people who work too hard
 The problem with overly serious people is
 They will work till they die
 This actually does not make them highly efficient
 Because they can't work if they die
 What you have to do to them is you have to tell them
 I know you don't want to do anything except work
 Maybe when you are not working
 You will sink into guilt
 But first figure out what you are doing
 What you are doing is doing everything possible
 Try with least doubt
 Use the longest sustainable time
 Possible ways to work efficiently
 That may mean you need to rest
 I used to work with lawyers
 They have risen to the top of a large law firm
 Are the kind of people who work super efficiently
 They often try to challenge
 Their impossible annual working hour quota
 In the end, I made myself burnt
 One of our actions for this situation is
 It won’t work for them to reduce the number of working days
 But we will let them extend their rest time
 For example, take a four-day weekend every two months
 Help them plan their work and rest schedule
 We will track and study their charging time
 Because this is their productivity
 The result is that their charging time has really improved
 This is great because you can tell workaholics
 Rest
 why
 Because it will make your work more efficient
 No this is impossible
 I should always try my best to work
 Then test it
 You take a break every now and then
 As a result, their work efficiency has increased
 Usually 10%
 So resting is also a kind of wisdom
 This is the end of Chapter One
 Foreshadowing the story of Adam and Eve
 You have self-awareness, you explore the future
 You have to work
 The question is how much do you have to work
 One answer is
 You better work hard all the time
 Because no matter how much you work
 You can't solve your problem
 Problems will always come
 You can save a bunch of money you want
 You can save a bunch of whatever you want
 But in the end none of these things can protect you
 So you'd better keep your feet on the ground and work hard
 It's best to do your best all the time
 What will happen if you do
 You will die
 That's not a good solution
 So maybe you should rest
 How to put rest into practice
 It's hard to say but there is a way
 Let's talk about it conceptually
 Even God has to take one day off every week
 So you don’t have to assume that
 If God had to take one day off every week
 Then you have to work non-stop
 I think our culture has been in a rather dangerous way
 Embarked on this astray
 Every place is open all day long
 But like you guys, I also find it very convenient
 It’s weird to talk to modern people
 The one thing they tell you most is
 We asked "how are you"
 What do they often say
 They don’t say “good” or “bad”
 They will say "busy"
 Speechless
 Well, the second chapter of "Genesis" starts here
 Finally here
 "The origin of the creation of heaven and earth
 "On the day when the Lord God made the heavens and the earth
 "That's it" (Genesis 2:4)
 "There is no vegetation in the wild
 "The vegetables in the field haven't grown
 "Because the Lord God has not rained on the earth
 "No one cultivates the land" (Gen 2:5)
 "But there is mist rising from the ground
 "Moisturizes everywhere" (Gen 2:6)
 "The Lord God used the dust of the earth to create man
 "Blow anger into his nostrils
 "He became a living being with spirit" (Gen 2:7)
 There is a very old idea here
 Breath is life
 Breath of inspiration
 They are all connected
 It's vitality like the air in the tires
 Is breathing
 The reason why people associate life with breath
 Not so stupid
 You are breathing this is what you are doing all the time
 When you die, breathing will stop
 Breath is an integral part of life
 This perfectly reasonable speculation happens to be very true
 The act of creating inspiration
 Connected
 Inject the breath of life into something inanimate
 What can you expect from this sentence
 It behaves well enough
 "The Lord God established a garden in Eden in the east" (Gen 2:8)
 Eden is a place with plenty of water
 This is especially meaningful
 If you are a resident of the desert
 The problem you are facing is
 "Is there enough water for you to grow things"
 This garden is the Paradise of Eden
 Where there is sufficient water
 Water has the characteristics of chaos
 We learned early in the first chapter of "Genesis"
 The underlying chaos is usually considered similar to water
 Is a symbol of water
 The same idea
 A certain amount of chaos must transform it into order
 So that chaos can become fruitful
 You know that all the fruits are nourished by water
 "The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground
 "It's pleasing to the eyes
 "The fruit on it is good for food
 "There is another tree of life in the garden
 "The tree of separation of good and evil" (Gen 2:9)
 So these two trees are divided
 Among them is the tree of life
 And the tree of good and evil
 When you are reading this kind of stuff, if you think
 You enter the category of metaphor
 We have to be cautious about metaphors
 Because i can say
 I did say
 The idea of ​​chaos and order is a metaphor
 I also said to think carefully
 Although this is a metaphor
 But this is also a way of thinking that your brain adapts to
 Let's stop playing tricks in this way of thinking
 It's just a metaphor and nothing more
 The same thing happened here
 These are metaphors
 The tree of life can distinguish good from evil
 They are not just metaphors
 Sometimes like I said before
 If you are in a series of things
 Use abstract thinking to propose a common factor
 You can have enough confidence to say
 The ratio of common factors extracted by abstraction
 This series of things is more real
 This is the practicality of abstraction
 Otherwise, why would you bother about it?
 If you can't list these things
 Cite this series of things
 Commonality more important than differences
 Then you don’t need abstract ability
 The tree of life and the tree that distinguishes good from evil
 Is the result of abstraction
 Now there is a problem
 Hard question
 I thought about it for a long time
 Why a fruit or something you eat
 Can be related to psychological changes
 It happened in the story of Adam and Eve
 Why something you eat
 Student of Eric Newman Jung
 Have studied this on this
 He gave a more appropriate explanation
 He said we always know the act of eating
 Especially when you are hungry or need food urgently
 Can produce a quick mental change
 This is worth noting some of you
 Probably have had a grumpy partner or child
 Everyone has experienced
 When their temperament becomes erratic
 Inexplicably cloudy and sunny
 You just give them some food
 Really I tell you it works very well
 I often do this to my patients
 They told me
 They will get furious about a little bit of something
 Well, let me say try this method for a week
 When your temper becomes unreasonable
 Eat a small cheese or peanut butter sandwich
 Eat some high-protein and high-fat foods
 Then wait ten minutes to see if you are normal
 You will find that sanity comes back after eating
 You can't believe it
 How crazy people would be when hungry
 This is amazing
 Try if you skip breakfast
 Your life will change
 Here are some useful information
 For those who are dissatisfied with society and ended up in prison
 If you are in jail you want to get parole
 You have to go to the judge
 Tell him why you won't do it again
 Here is a trick
 What you have done is not that important
 The promise you made is not important
 The important thing is
 Did you see the judge before he had lunch or after lunch
 If it was after the judge had lunch,
 Your chances of getting parole will increase by 60%
 Yes that's it
 So never when you are hungry
 Argue with your partner
 Or when they are hungry
 Especially when you want something from them
 Best to come here and have a sandwich
 They will eat it and you are at your disposal
 Don't think about it before they eat
 So this idea is not unreasonable
 There is a certain spirit in the food that can make you refreshed
 Not only to refresh your body
 Mentally too
 Of course, other things can also achieve this effect
 But they are not like food
 Has a great influence on our spirit
 Take alcohol for example
 Dionysus
 He is Bacchus
 Bacchus takes over your body
 And let you do all kinds of funny things that alcohol brings you
 An act that will make you regret it when you wake up the next day
 So it has such a spiritual element
 But going deeper
 It connects food and information, which is great
 The story of Adam and Eve shows
 Fruits make psychological changes
 So the tree of good and evil
 Is an abstract summary of all trees
 It tries to tell you that there are commonalities between trees and trees
 Fruit is the commonality of trees
 Probably like that
 You might call this commonality food
 Although it's only a rough generalization, it doesn't lose sense
 What’s cooler is in the whole food field
 The most stable element is not food
 But the information it contains
 We use the same brain circuit to search for information
 The brain circuit of squirrel searching for food is the same
 It’s the same brain circuit as animals searching for food
 Why is it the same
 Because we understand
 Knowing where to have food is more important than having food
 Knowing where the food is the primary form of food
 Information is meta food
 This is why we are the collectors of information
 Once you catch this point
 This idea is rooted in the story of Adam and Eve
 No matter what the food form inside
 What they eat is meta food
 Some kind of information
 We will exchange information with food, right
 Imagine you are trapped by the highway
 You open the hood
 Found your car turned into a pile of scrap iron
 You have no idea about it
 Suddenly someone stopped next to you
 They are mechanics
 They pointed to a device and said
 You just put that wire back there
 You will give him a sandwich right away, right
 Or something else in return
 You know what I mean because they provide you
 Valuable information
 Information is valuable because it gives you motivation
 Information can power you
 Otherwise, why would we bother about it?
 So it’s the same with food providing power information
 Food philosophy
 That you can get from all the things you can eat
 Furthermore, you can get from all sources of food
 What is abstracted out is information
 The tree in the story of Adam and Eve is the meta form of the tree
 Not the normality of the tree
 It’s like heaven is not a specific ordinary place
 Just like Adam and Eve are not ordinary people
 Like the logos used by God at the beginning of time
 Not just concepts
 They are not just metaphors
 Something deeper than metaphor
 I think this is surreal
 They are more real than what you see
 More real than what you see
 Many things are like this
 The numbers are like this
 Just because there is something more real than seeing
 Then you will think and do abstract refinement
 So what is the real thing
 This is also part of what we want to understand
 "The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground
 "It's pleasing to the eyes
 "The fruit on it is good for food
 "There is another tree of life in the garden
 "The Tree of Separation of Good and Evil" (Genesis 2:9)
 "A river flows from Eden to nourish the garden
 "Divided into four paths from there" (Gen 2:10)
 There are a lot of conjectures here
 Eden is also a holy city
 This is another way of looking at it
 Or Jerusalem
 Or an ideal country may also be an ideal city
 It may also be the ideal state of being
 Or ideal mind
 It's all of them superimposed together
 This is an imaginary mandala form
 Make up the structure of heaven
 You will notice that it has this cross pattern
 This is the Garden of Eden itself
 This is the center of the Garden of Eden, this is the river
 Those on the left are rivers, not snakes
 Those are the rivers that flow from the garden
 And they were transformed into representatives that Jung described as me
 These mandala images
 Will be the core element of the conscious being
 Jung combined it with divinity
 And the concept of holy city
 I show you this
 To present the concept of imaginary heaven
 "The first one is named Bisson
 "It surrounds the whole land of Havilah
 "There is gold" (Genesis 2:11)
 "And the gold there is good
 "There are pearls and red agates there" (Gen 2:12)
 "The name of the second river is Gihon
 "It surrounds the whole land of Cush" (Gen 2:13)
 "The name of the third river is Tigris
 "It flows east of Assyria
 "The fourth river is the Euphrates" (Gen 2:14)
 There’s something weird about geography
 Hybrid with mythical geography
 You will find this often appears in the Bible
 "The Lord God will
 "Placed in the Garden of Eden
 "Make him repair the guard" (Gen 2.15)
 This is a good command
 That's what you should do
 Manage these things
 There is a lot of work to be done
 It took a whole week
 "The Lord God told him to say
 "The fruits of all the trees in the garden
 "You can eat whatever you want" (Gen 2:16)
 "Just the fruit on the tree of good and evil
 "You must not eat
 "Because you must die the day you eat" (Gen 2:17)
 There are a bunch of problems here
 People have been confused about this for a long time
 God is a weird character in the story of Adam and Eve
 If we can't eat this
 Why did you put it in the garden at the beginning
 This will be a problem
 You created us and you told us not to eat it
 Obviously very clear
 The first thing we will do is eat it
 Because people are so natural
 If you tell these
 People with insatiable curiosity
 Said "It's all good here
 "And there is a place you can never see"
 Then you leave here
 And everyone was there trying to figure out what it was
 In a blink of an eye, right
 We are very curious creatures
 So you want to know what God’s intention is here
 There is a Gnostic conjecture
 The first god
 Not a good god
 He is a somewhat unconscious evil god
 He hopes his creation has no consciousness
 So as to prevent them from developing awareness
 And here again a higher-level god appeared
 He may be in the image of a poisonous snake
 The god who lures people to consciousness
 This concept was eliminated by classical Christianity very early
 Although it has some interesting things
 And it takes various forms
 Remnants left in the story
 For example, think "fallen"
 Is a completely tragic point of view
 But on the other hand
 It is a prerequisite for the greatest event in history
 Which is the birth of Jesus
 Salvation with mankind
 so
 Put it this way, it's complicated
 Only God knows what he is going to do
 This is a good example of that ambivalence
 to me
 This again shows how smart the people who integrate these stories are
 I still think this is almost a miracle
 Because you know
 If you are just a promoter
 You won't keep such complicated things in the text
 You will just lose it
 Because if you are a promoter
 Everything should make sense on the ideological level
 God should be good here
 So we better delete this sentence
 Because something goes in and out of it
 And it's not obvious what it is
 But people didn't do it
 To me it shows that people are doing two things
 That they try to
 Not careless
 They are risking contact with them
 And they are very careful about tradition
 And trying to figure out what happened
 Because otherwise, why should I record these?
 Why not simplify them
 Or maybe
 Attribute these simply to the devil
 It’s better than letting God do these things
 Much simpler
 "The Lord God says
 "It's not good for that person to live alone
 "I will make him a spouse to help him" (Gen 2:18)
 "The wild beasts that the Lord God made with soil
 "And all the birds in the sky
 "Bring them to that person
 "Look at his name
 "How that person calls all kinds of living creatures,
 "That's its name" (Gen 2:19)
 "The man gave all the livestock"
 Livestock generally refers to animals
 "And the birds in the sky
 "The wild beasts are named
 "It's just that the person didn't meet
 "Spouse helps him" (Gen 2:20)
 Here are a few things to guess
 First why does God care
 What did Adam call these animals
 Again the answer seems
 Is related to the magic of words
 According to the story we know
 Humans have
 Was created in the image of God
 And God uses language
 To summon order from chaos
 Human beings were created in that image
 So there is a resonance here
 Although it comes from an independent tradition
 This resonance is
 Things are not real enough before you name it
 This is an interesting thing
 And we don’t know exactly where this will extend
 The usual situation is
 Things often exist in a peculiar underlying form
 Form of internal connection
 Everything in it is very confusing
 Until you point it out and name it
 What exactly happened when you named it
 It opened itself up from the potential chaos
 And turn yourself into
 Tangible entities you can oppose
 Of course you might say
 It's real before you name it
 "It was real before you named it."
 And "things exist before no one observes"
 It's the same thing
 When you are not observing things
 It is not clear whether things exist
 I want to tell you about the weird side of perception
 You can find it here in John Wheeler
 John Wheeler is a physicist
 The cool thing is
 If you go out at night
 Then I looked up and saw the stars
 The photons from this star reach your eyes
 This photon may have been roaming for 30 million years
 Do you know
 This photon from that star
 If your eyes don’t receive it here and now
 May not be sent
 You might think how is this possible
 Because this happened 20 million years ago
 Actually I don’t know how this is possible
 But I know John Wheeler
 Do a lot of work to describe in detail
 Why this is necessarily true
 Wheeler still developed
 Physicist with the concept of "Everything comes from bits"
 He believes
 Potential part of the world
 Best to be analyzed as a place for potential information
 The role of consciousness is to transform potential information into
 Something similar to concrete reality
 He is not just making an analogy
 One of the basis given by him
 The story I told you just now
 If the photon doesn’t have a destination
 It is impossible to leave where it is
 This is complicated and puzzling
 Because from the perspective of a beam of light originating from photons
 There is no time
 There is no distance from one place to another
 Of course this seems completely incomprehensible
 But from the perspective of a photon
 The universe is completely flat
 Perpendicular to the direction of photon travel
 It exists everywhere at the same time
 Not for us
 It was 20 million years ago
 But for photon, it is everywhere
 Anyway, the reason I tell you this is
 The relationship between consciousness and reality
 Definitely not clear
 It's not clear at all
 Physicists also argue
 The relationship between consciousness and reality
 They also argue
 What does the phenomenon I just described mean
 I really don't have the right to join this argument
 Because i am not a physicist
 But I read quite Wheeler’s philosophy
 As far as I can understand
 I also at least understand that this is what he claims
 I also know that this assertion is capable of understanding Wheeler’s
 Physicists are taken seriously
 This is very interesting
 Anyway, there is a
 Emphasis on the importance of making things real
 You know sometimes people don’t name things
 Just for them not to become reality
 If you have a relationship
 Obviously you have
 It will have problems
 Obviously it will
 You actually know
 Many times there are things that nobody wants to name
 Is hidden
 Everyone is thinking
 As long as we don’t give it a name, it’s not there
 To some extent it is indeed not there
 Because you can pretend it's not there
 Then get away with it
 At least in the short term
 But once you give it a name
 You gave it the form and no one can ignore it anymore
 It's irritating because then you have to deal with it
 Or face the consequences
 The reason I tell you this is
 We have an intuition
 Can make things non-existent by not naming things
 You name it and it appears very clearly
 This is not to say that naming is the only thing that makes it a reality
 But it sharpens things and brings it into focus
 And gave it boundaries and scope
 Whatever God wants to say to Adam
 Have enough interest
 He asked Adam to name all the animals
 This makes them into animals to some extent
 There is more important than this for this language story
 Roger Brown
 Studied this interesting phenomenon
 It is related to the relationship between perception and action
 Do you know how the child treats
 Is a specific animal called a cat
 The word cat is as short as the word dog
 We can think of cats as multicellular organisms
 Because we can see the cells
 We can see the molecules we can see the atoms
 We can also see the ecosystem that cats belong to
 Or broader classification of mammals it belongs to
 We can think of it as a unit of perception
 But we don't
 We observe things at the level of cats
 You can tell what people can perceive naturally
 Perceptual level
 By the way this anyway
 It's not determined by social culture
 Because these words are usually short
 Easy to remember and learned very early
 Analysis on this level
 It exists in this world
 In every possible level of analysis
 We perceive it with a specific level of analysis
 And the analysis at this level seems to be
 At that level, the world is related to our functional utility
 Perception at that level
 And the naming of that level
 Make things at that level a reality
 The characteristics of things are
 They are not easily separated from other things
 They are entangled in all sorts of strange ways
 But when we cast our eyes and use language
 To point one's direction in the world
 We divide things into what we can use
 Distinguishable things
 Something about this
 Somehow make them
 Than they were before
 The potential to connect with each other is more real
 At least this is not the same type of reality
 I think even more untrue
 I think this is the right way to look at it
 Even if it is not completely untrue
 It is a resonance
 Adam is a little god at this moment
 Little God Little Father
 And God has done the basic work well
 But Adam needs to show up and say
 This is a cat
 No matter what it is now it is a cat
 And that's a dog, that's a sheep
 This gives them something similar to actual form
 "It's just that the man didn't meet his spouse to help him" (Genesis 2:20)
 "The Lord God made him fall asleep and he fell asleep
 "So he took off one of his ribs
 "Put the flesh together again" (Gen 2:21)
 "The Lord God used the ribs taken from the man
 "Cause a woman to lead her to that man" (Gen 2:22)
 "The man said, "This is the flesh of my bones
 "『You can call her a woman
 "'Because she was taken out of a man'" (Gen 2:23)
 "So people have to leave their parents
 "Unite with your wife and become one body" (Gen 2:24)
 The last three sentences have a powerful expression
 The word "therefore" seems surprising
 But here is a command
 This is a good command
 Because people who don't
 Will spend a very painful time in marriage
 If you are married or plan to get married
 Then you should know this
 We tend to fall to our parents for many reasons
 The command here is
 Once you get married, other things are second-rate
 And failing to do this order will make your marriage fall apart
 And to me it collapsed, you deserve it
 Because it reflects your pathological immaturity
 And you are
 Unwillingness to escape from parental control
 These parents are too in a position of interference
 But this command
 There is a very profound command
 It's complicated
 There is a view that Adam was not originally a man
 Not a single man
 He is more like an androgynous being
 In this hermaphrodite being
 There are species divided into males and females
 Undifferentiated perfection
 Part of humanity’s goal is to reunite the two
 Restore the original perfect individual
 This is actually the spiritual goal of marriage
 You can read something from Jung
 Jung wrote a lot about this point of view
 What a great point of view
 I have a couple who went to Sweden to get married
 They are from North Alberta
 But they inherited the Swedish tradition
 They did a cool thing at the wedding
 Just when they are about to get married
 They put a candle between each other
 When they got married
 You would think what a candle is
 It is the source of light
 It is the source of lighting
 It is the source of enlightenment
 It is the candle you put on the Christmas tree in Europe
 It is the light that emerges from the darkness in the cold winter
 It is a sign of life in the dark
 It is the reappearance of the sun at the darkest and coldest time of the year
 This is also symbolic for various complicated reasons
 Related to the birth of Christ
 So candles are all this
 The next question is why do you hold it over the top
 Because what is higher than you is what is lower than you
 It symbolizes something transcendent
 For example, why do you hold it tightly together
 Because you should all hold onto the light tightly, right
 You should obey the light
 You will ask who is leading the marriage
 Is light
 That's what I mean
 You become one together
 You are no longer both
 It's not about what is good for you or your wife
 This is good for marriage
 Marriage-related beings
 At the beginning
 Reorganization of the presence of hermaphrodite
 That's what I mean
 And all meanings are included in four sentences
 All sentences are
 Associated with a lot of historical interpretation
 It's endless and it's just some of them
 It also corrected since the woman was taken from the man
 This is also the opposite of the biological process
 And subordinate women to men
 This is not the meaning of this passage
 I don't think this is the meaning of this passage at all
 There are other links in this passage
 There is a view that
 The princess sleeps in "Sleeping Beauty"
 And the reason she fell asleep was
 You must remember what happened
 She has a pair of older parents
 Anxious for a child
 Like many people now
 They only have one child
 Like many people now
 They don’t want anything bad to happen to their children
 It's like this is a miracle
 And only one
 And she is a princess
 So we don't let anything approach her
 They held a baptism ceremony
 They invited everyone
 But they did not invite Mel Fiscent
 Melficent is the mother of fear
 She is nature itself
 She is something that suddenly entered the night
 In other words, she is the devil himself
 She is everything you don't want your child to meet
 So the king and queen said
 Then let's not invite her to the baptism ceremony
 Want to be beautiful
 This is an Oedipus story, right
 Oedipus’ mother is that
 Ruined their mother by overprotecting her children
 So instead of the children
 Become stronger by touching this world
 Was weakened by excessive protection
 In this way, when they are put into the world
 They cannot survive
 This is the story of "Sleeping Beauty"
 This is what the king and queen did
 They apologized to Melficent when she showed up
 They have a bunch of stupid
 Why didn’t you ask her an excuse "We forgot"
 I don’t think you will forget this kind of thing
 And she seems to have explained
 The horror of life
 You can’t forget it when you have a child
 You might want it to be controlled
 But you won't forget it
 The key is whether you invite it to the party
 The answer is that it all depends on
 How ignorant you want your child to become
 If you want your child to be ignorant
 Then you get the added benefit that they won’t leave home
 You can use them for the rest of your tragic life
 Instead of leaving them to find something to do
 Of course you can retaliate against them
 Whenever they have a little bit of you 30 years ago
 The impulse to pursue courage
 And as soon as you see it develop in your child
 Just want to destroy it
 This is another interesting thing
 This is the story in "Sleeping Beauty"
 These are all unpleasant
 Everything that happened in the story is unpleasant
 Sleeping Beauty is terribly naive
 Her parents settled her in the forest
 Let the three have no real ability and strength
 The hypocritical good old fairy raised her
 They are harmless
 Then she and the first idiot prince who passed by
 Too deep in love
 So that when he rode away
 She has post-traumatic stress disorder
 That's it
 Then she walked into the castle extremely excited
 Because she and her love in this life
 See you for about five minutes, my God
 This is the spinning wheel
 Which is when the wheel of fortune appears
 Stabbed her finger
 They tried to get rid of the wheel of fortune and their spikes
 But she found it and poked her finger
 Fell down unconsciously
 But she hopes that she is not surprised at all
 She was protected all her life
 And very naive
 So that her first love relationship was almost fatal
 She hopes to sleep and never wake up
 This is exactly what actually happened
 So she had to wait for the prince to save her
 How sexist do you think this story is
 Seriously because this is the modern world
 Will interpret it
 She doesn't need a prince to save her
 This is why Disney filmed "Frozen"
 This movie is really shocking trash
 You can say that the princess does not need the prince to save
 But this is a stupid way of looking at the story
 Because the prince is not just a man who goes to save a woman
 Believe me he has his own problems
 There is a whole dragon that needs him to fight
 The prince also represents women's own consciousness
 Consciousness is often expressed as a masculine symbol in stories
 Logos’s point of view is the same
 This view refers to
 There is no forward brave consciousness
 Women themselves fall into unconsciousness and fear
 You can understand
 A sleeping woman needs a man to wake up
 Of course just as men need women to wake up
 This is the same as the Dragon Slaying in "Sleeping Beauty"
 But it also means that if she is not conscious
 She can only lie there to sleep
 Like the naive and the cursed
 She must wake herself
 And pushed her masculine consciousness to the forefront
 So that she can survive in the world
 Obviously women are doing their best
 But this story only shows part
 This is also implied by the following view
 Ie unless the female is separated from the male
 Otherwise she is not a human, she is just a creature
 This is part of the story rooted in this
 So you don’t want to understand it as patriarchal
 You don't want to understand everything in this way
 I don't want to repeat
 But really we can do better than this
 "So people have to leave their parents
 "Combine with your wife, and the two will become one" (Gen 2:24)
 Another career about marriage is worth knowing
 I learned partly from Jung
 What did you do when you got married
 Very simple
 You find someone as bad as yourself
 Then torture yourself with this person
 Then said we will never leave
 No matter what happens
 This is great because then you won't run away
 The truth is if you can escape
 You can't tell the truth
 If you tell the truth to others and they don’t run away
 Then they are not listening
 If there is no one by your side who can't escape
 You can't tell the truth to them
 This is also one of the purposes of marriage
 I bet on you you bet on me
 We all know this is a failed bet
 But considering the status quo
 We are unlikely to find better people
 Two things can be drawn here
 One is that people always wait to meet the right person
 You can think about it so you know it
 If you go to a party to find Prince Charming
 And he saw you running away without screaming
 This means he is not a prince charming at all
 It's like an old Nietzsche joke
 "If someone loves you
 "He will immediately lose his charm in your eyes."
 Or Woody Allen-style jokes
 "I will never join a club that will allow me to join"
 This is something worth thinking about
 You will treat yourself to someone who is as imperfect as you
 Tied together
 This way you may enter a situation where you can really negotiate
 You may think you have some problems
 I also have some questions
 Regardless of the consequences
 We are all grasshoppers tied to a rope for the next 50 years
 We can either solve these things
 Or suffer 50 years
 People belong to the kind
 Not aware of the severity of this matter
 Then these problems will not be solved
 You don’t name those things and choose to ignore them
 Because you always have a way out
 Living with someone else is one thing
 Cohabitation before marriage
 More likely to divorce than vice versa
 the reason is
 What are your intentions when you live with someone
 Just think about it
 So far
 You are the best person i can fool
 But I want to reserve the right to replace you at any time
 If a better person happens to hit me
 How can anyone not be offended by this proposal
 They will be willing to cooperate
 Because they will treat you the same way
 That's it
 I know you won't promise me
 It means you don't take me
 Or our relationship is at the highest position
 But as long as I can leave when I want
 I would also play with you
 This is incredible, you might think
 It’s too stupid to tie yourself to someone else
 Really stupid, no doubt
 But it’s better than other options
 There are some things you'll never learn without this restraint
 Because you can avoid it, you always have a way out
 If you can leave, you don't have to tell the truth
 It's that simple, you can leave directly
 So you don’t have anyone who can be honest with you
 These pictures are all representations of "origin"
 These are not all Adam
 This picture is an ancient Chinese symbol
 I remember it was called Fuxi and Nuwa
 I think my pronunciation is not accurate enough
 But it is really cool
 Look at the snake below
 They are a bit like DNA symbols
 I think it's interesting
 They are the embryonic form of the giant snake in the primitive universe
 All potential is born from it
 And there is a division between male and female
 So it's like an unknown predator
 This is a way to understand it
 The most basic concept of mankind is the unknown predator
 Then there are two
 The division of basic cognitive elements
 Positive and negative
 You can see a similar situation in this picture
 This picture is from Egypt
 Also very old
 This giant snake forms the basis of everything
 It is divided into Isis Queen of the Underworld
 King of Osiris, King of Swan, Pharaoh, King of Order
 You are in ancient alchemy symbols
 Can see the same thing
 I like it because it looks so much like
 The little things Harry Potter chased
 This is not accidental
 Seekers are responsible for chasing this
 Win if you catch it
 This is really an old idea
 I can’t figure out how J.K. Rowling knew
 Because this is a very old mysterious symbol
 It is called "Circular Chaos" on Google
 I searched for "circular chaos" on Google
 Only relevant references can be found on my page
 So I don’t know how Rowling came up with it
 Although I know she has read a lot of ancient documents
 "If you catch this thing in the meta game,
 "You will win all games"
 The above idea is completely correct
 This is what is called Quidditch's theme
 This is "potential"
 God is in this potential
 Created the world at the beginning of time
 And what emerged from it was a certain
 Turi, that's the dragon
 Fighting another dragon
 This is partly the snake in the Garden of Eden
 And then it also showed masculine and feminine
 Potential predator unknown positive and negative
 This is like the evolution history of human cognitive consciousness
 Single manifestation of
 This is very powerful
 And this is an ideal image
 This is a union of the sun and the moon
 A superbiological hermaphrodite
 This is also Adam and Eve at the beginning of time
 Before the "fall" happened
 This is also the purpose of marriage
 This is a sacrament
 Is shown in all these images
 The wide range of images that can be included in this concept
 Is totally incredible
 These are some more classic forms of expression
 About Eve being taken out of Adam’s body
 This is a very cool sentence
 "At that time, the husband and wife were naked
 "Not ashamed" (Gen 2:25)
 I wrote this sentence because someone
 Surprised that Adam and Eve are not ashamed
 Otherwise, why would they point it out
 There are two things implied here
 For the first time, human beings were naked
 They are not ashamed
 The second period is now
 Humans are ashamed when they are naked
 The question is how nudity and shame are linked together
 In the classic interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve
 The connotative meaning of sex often appears
 I think it's related to being naked
 But I don’t think it’s that simple
 Right my daughter
 She might be because of me in this lecture
 Get angry at revealing it
 When my daughter was a child
 Never worry about being naked
 Whether to wear clothes or not is the same to her
 But when my son was three years old
 But has paid great attention to privacy
 The door of his bedroom is always closed
 Same for bathroom
 It’s like saying "Get out"
 These things seem to happen autonomously
 We have two children
 One is very privacy-conscious and the other is not
 I don't think
 The occurrence of this situation has a lot to do with us
 It’s a magical process for my son to become self-aware
 This kind of self-consciousness does appear in
 In children around three years old
 We usually think at this time
 Maybe let the kids play around naked on the beach
 Not a very good idea
 In some cases children are naked in public
 Usually no problem
 We would consider it acceptable
 Why i don't know
 Why is nudity gradually becoming unacceptable
 Obviously it has to do with sex
 But this is a very complicated phenomenon
 Nudity is a very complicated thing
 First of all, humans are a bit strange
 Because compared to most animals
 We have very little body hair
 We don't know why
 Some people think that when humans first wandered in Africa
 Lost hair
 Humans are really good at running
 We can chase animals until they fall
 A good-sized human
 Can run a horse to death in a week
 We really can run
 There are many of our ancestors
 For example, the Kalahari bushmen are still doing this
 They will chase animals until they are exhausted
 But these bushmen are safe and sound
 They sometimes use poisonous arrows to kill animals
 But they can exhaust them just by chasing them
 We have great endurance
 If you want to run around in the desert
 Then we need to be able to dissipate heat in time
 So we don’t have any hair. This is an explanation
 Buckminster Fowler has an interesting explanation for this
 He believed that at some point in our evolution,
 We have been by the water for a long time
 We are like "fish apes" like fish apes
 We like to stay on the beach
 A lot of food there
 We also like swimming
 Us as land animals
 Really good at swimming
 And we are the same as some marine life
 The tears you shed when you cry are salty
 Women have a layer of subcutaneous fat
 This is the same as some marine life
 It's weird that our feet
 Good at slapping in the water
 Although we can also walk with them
 So he thinks
 Maybe this adaptation is to live in the water
 Just like seals and other animals
 We are kind of alive back to the ocean but not quite so
 Anyway, it’s interesting to have Mao gone
 It does expose us to the environment
 But animals with fur are not like this
 And we are upright
 This is strange because most animals are not
 They are all on all fours
 Make their fragile parts
 Are protected and not exposed to sight
 Of course when you stand naked
 Your physical and mental qualities are being painfully displayed
 People often complain about this
 If you look at the feminist strategy
 For example, they make a fuss about the concept of "beauty"
 Women suffering from eating disorders can be directly attributed to
 On the cover of the magazine
 Too many beauties printed
 Even if the people buying these magazines are women
 They are attracted by these magazines
 They feel good when they buy
 If the stimulus is negative
 That women would avoid these magazines
 Instead of buying them
 So as a theory
 It's very bad
 But it is
 Examples of "beauty standards make people feel ashamed"
 Even if you are not ugly now
 It will definitely become ugly at some stage in the future
 This is a difficult thing to deal with
 Knowing that I can be the perfect look
 Even I used to be perfect
 But this state will not last long
 Or never become perfect is a painful thing
 I think it is more painful for women
 Because women are more often men
 Comment on age and fertility
 This is the result of discussion from the perspective of evolution
 Men are more often women
 Evaluate in terms of socioeconomic status
 Both situations are harsh
 No matter how you know that you are exposed to
 To all aspects of your life
 Before the harshest judges
 Is a terrible thing
 And if you are not wearing clothes
 This judgment will be further amplified
 To a certain extent clothing plays a protective role
 But the bigger role of clothing is just to prevent others
 Have always been harsh on you
 It can have such an impact
 So this story proves
 We were not like that at a certain time
 Animals are not like that
 So the inference that "we are not like that"
 Seems reasonable
 But in a certain period
 This situation has changed
 "At that time, the husband and wife were naked
 "Not ashamed" (Gen 2:25)
 "The Jehovah God made
 "Only snakes are more cunning than all the living creatures in the field
 "The snake said to the woman, "Does God really say
 "'You are not allowed to eat
 ""Are the fruits on all the trees in the garden?" (Genesis 3:1)
 I like this print
 I can't remember who painted this
 Who is it
 Doray is right
 It was Duo Lei who made the engraving illustrations for "Paradise Lost"
 It was Duo Lei who made the engraving illustrations for "Paradise Lost"
 Really beautiful
 This side is Satan and this side is a snake
 Of course in the "Genesis" story
 Satan and the snake are strangely linked
 It's hard to clarify
 In the story of Adam and Eve
 There is no indication
 The snake that tempted Eve is also Satan
 Is the initiator of all evil
 As for how these two stories are tangled together
 I think i know the answer
 I will reveal it for you tonight
 But it really took me a long time to figure it out
 It's really wonderful
 I can't believe people figure it out
 It's incredibly colorful
 This is a hint to this idea, right
 There is a close relationship between these two things
 In short, snakes are more cunning than all creatures in the world
 Cunning is a funny word
 This is the explanation in the Oxford English Dictionary
 We will enlarge the word slightly
 This is exactly what you did in the analysis of Jung’s dream
 You will pay attention to dreams
 Implied meaning of some concepts
 Cunning "Describes the actions of humans or animals, etc.
 "Cunning, cunning, cunning, unfaithful"
 This is very mysterious and low-key, right
 It is not easy to find
 "Describe the appearance or gaze is cunning, sneaky and sneaky"
 "Describe people who are experienced to be professional and smart"
 "Describe a piece of art, machinery, etc.
 "Ingenious, unique and sophisticated production or design"
 I think until now
 These terms are derived from snake
 I think they are very cool
 And the physiological structure is very clever
 They are eye-catching
 But at the same time it’s not easy to detect
 "Describe one that contains
 "The nature of obscure distinctions or subtle ideas
 "Profound and hard to understand"
 "Describe a person’s mental and intellectual activities
 "Characterized by wisdom and insight
 "He has the ability to discern and is very shrewd"
 This is really interesting
 Because Milton’s Satan is very intelligent
 And this happens often
 Bad guys are often evil scientists
 You see the same in the Lion King
 Scar is a smart character
 An arrogant and deceitful but intelligent
 It's not stupid at all
 It is not a wise man but it is that
 The evil voice that always whispers in the ears of the lion king
 This is related to the inner pride of the wise
 Catholics have been warning mankind for centuries
 Don't be proud of human wisdom
 This partly caused
 The split between Catholicism and science
 Although if you look at the history
 You will find that the Catholic idea is exaggerated
 The idea is
 Talented people have a special ability
 And it is the highest angel in the kingdom of God
 This is how Milton describes it
 But it can also be bad
 Because intellect can be because of own existence
 And achievement and become conceited
 It will fall in love with its own results
 When you are occupied by ideology
 This happens too
 Because what you end up with is the dogma created by humans
 In the words of Solzhenitsyn
 "You are completely controlled by it
 "You believe it is 100% correct"
 It ends all transcendental things
 So this is an implicit factor of intellect
 Symbolically linked with the snake in the Garden of Eden
 "Describes keen insight such as sense, touch, etc."
 "Including that you can feel subtle or subtle differences
 "Especially those differences that are too subtle to distinguish or analyze
 "Also almost imperceptible and elusive."
 "Describe the thickness or width is very thin and thin"
 "Subtle things and scarce things"
 This kind of thing hardly exists
 "The woman said to the snake
 ""We can eat the fruit from the trees in the garden (Genesis 3:2)
 "'Only the fruit of the tree in the garden
 "『God once said
 "『You must not eat or touch
 ""Lest you die"" (Genesis 3:3)
 "The snake said to the woman, "You don't necessarily die (Genesis 3:4)
 "'Because God knows the day you eat
 "『The eyes are bright
 ""As God can know good and evil" (Genesis 3:5)
 Cunning, subtle, is this a good story?
 In this way it immediately hints
 "You can't believe in God"
 It's cunning
 Then it said "and God is trying to deceive you"
 "And God did this out of jealousy"
 "And God doesn't want you to know what he knows
 "It's not good to let you know."
 "And God is lying to you
 "Because you won't die anyway."
 "If you eat it is contrary to what was warned before
 "Your eyes will brighten and nothing more
 "You will become like God, knowing good and evil."
 This sounds really good
 And what does Eve know?
 No wonder she is so easily affected by rhetoric
 It's also fun
 Because God warned Adam and Eve
 Don't eat that damn fruit
 But they never promised that they would not eat
 They did not guarantee that they were just warned
 Should they obey
 How obedient do you want your child to be
 You hope they are submissive enough
 So as not to get hurt
 But not obedient enough
 So that they can break into the sky
 Do something brave
 Break some rules
 Learn something
 This is a very contradictory story
 Anyway, the snake won this round
 Eve listened to what the snake said
 The same set of pictures
 We have Adam and Eve
 We have this tree we have this weird snake
 It appears as a dragon like a sphinx
 And is associated with the tree
 The snake is always associated with the tree
 God knows we have done this for tens of millions of years
 Arboreal primates
 There are three main types of our main natural enemies
 Snake, raptor, big cat
 So the snake is related to the tree
 It's been a long long time
 The lesson the snake teaches people is
 You better be alert
 Otherwise the things you don't like will hurt you
 So who is the easiest to follow snakes?
 That will be eve
 The reason is that Eve has offspring
 And for snakes there is nothing more delicious than children
 Eve's uneasiness and neuroticism are completely justified
 They are more likely to have these qualities than men and women
 And the difference is very obvious
 This exists in many cultures
 And first appeared in puberty
 According to our current understanding
 Part of the reason is that women are more vulnerable to sexual assault
 Women are also smaller
 In case of physical conflict
 Body size to urinate can be a weakness
 More importantly, why do we assume
 The human female’s nervous system changes
 To adapt to her health
 Why don't we assume
 Changes in the nervous system of human women
 To adapt to the parent-child relationship between her and her child
 Because if it weren't the case, the babies would die
 You might think
 Are more prone than men and women
 Depression and anxiety
 This is an unimaginable heavy burden
 By the way, this also exists in a cross-cultural environment
 This also appeared at the beginning of adolescence
 The most noticeable difference is in Scandinavia
 Some people think that these characteristics are formed by social culture
 But in fact, it's not
 But this is for a reason, also in puberty
 Sexual differences between men and women began to appear
 Men's upper body is more powerful
 Much stronger than women
 So this makes men much more dangerous
 Human’s instinctive defense mechanism is boxing
 Like a kangaroo
 There are other animals that can also punch
 Chimpanzees can too
 But when humans strike, their power is concentrated on the upper body and shoulders
 So women cannot compete with men in the battle
 She has every reason to be nervous
 Especially when women are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault
 And she must be in a long time
 Take care of a fragile baby who is extremely dependent on her
 In addition, women are more nervous and uncomfortable than men
 The empirical literature on this point is clear
 It is associated with emotional instability
 Because it's actually an unpleasant emotion
 Who wants to be uncomfortable
 If I am very afraid of making a fool of myself when I talk to you on stage
 Then suddenly I won’t be able to talk to you
 What I will do is always think about myself
 And all my shortcomings and mistakes
 Fall into one's heart
 Although this personality trait is a great talent
 But it's not pleasant
 It is mainly associated with anxiety
 So Eve has every reason to pay attention to snakes.
 I read a story this week
 The bad thing is that I don’t remember which tribe it was about
 But I added a footnote about this in my new book
 These are people living in jungle tribes
 5% of adults have been attacked by pythons
 And a large number of children were killed by pythons
 Snake predation is no joke
 It shapes our past in evolutionary history
 And it still happens frequently in many areas
 We have adapted to the existence of snakes
 Anthropologist Lynn Isbel points out
 We are very good at spotting camouflage patterns on snakes
 Especially in the lower half of our vision
 There is evidence that
 Humans have such a keen vision
 In other words, our eyes become brighter
 Partly because we have co-evolved with snakes
 We learn to recognize them
 At the expense of our brains grow up together
 You need a lot of brain capacity to see
 The result of human brain growth is
 One day we woke up and found the future
 The future is where all snakes may live
 Instead of where they are now
 These same images are very interesting
 In this picture, the god of death appears on the tree
 With snake and fruit
 The fruit also looks interesting
 I already said
 There is a strong correlation between the food you eat and the information
 This is a conceptual connection
 Is also an actual connection
 And we can distinguish colors
 The question is why
 The answer is that we have evolved
 You can distinguish ripe fruits with your eyes
 In the story of Adam and Eve
 Humans gain vision through snakes and fruits
 It turns out to be correct
 Great, right?
 So you think that for men
 What role does a woman play in a relationship
 First of all they make men uncomfortable
 Let us never forget this
 I want to talk about the main role of women in the relationship with men
 Just to make them feel uncomfortable
 Men don't like that much
 And nothing is more disturbing than being rejected
 Why is he rejected
 Obviously because of mother nature
 Telling you in the image of that woman
 "You are pretty good to be friends
 "But there is no special reason for your genetic material
 "Be spread and continue into the future"
 Men feel uncomfortable with being made by women
 Not happy at all, right
 This is between men and women
 The main source of ongoing tension
 It's not surprising
 But there is another situation
 It’s pretty cool and very interesting
 We and the chimpanzee were around 600 years ago
 Differences appeared after the common ancestor advanced
 Here are the reasons at least to some extent
 Female chimpanzees are treated equally when it comes to mating
 They mate with any male chimpanzee when in heat
 Human women would not
 When a female chimpanzee is in heat
 Any male has a chance
 High-status male chimpanzees drive away competitors
 So the male chimpanzee with the highest status
 Will be more likely to leave offspring
 But it’s not the female chimpanzee’s choice
 Humans are not like this
 Human women often "marry high"
 This also exists in different cultural regions
 This is also widespread in Scandinavia
 There is a little attenuation but not much attenuation
 Women usually marry men at a higher level of dominance
 And men will marry women at a lower level of dominance
 Must be like this
 Because it has to be like this. If one goes up and the other goes down
 The socioeconomic status of a woman
 Has little effect on her attractiveness to men
 The socioeconomic status of a man
 Is the main determinant of his attractiveness to women
 And it doesn’t mean his wealth
 This has been proven
 But refers to his ability to produce and share
 This is much better than wealth
 Wealth will disappear but this ability to produce and share
 Is a more important factor
 Then why not choose on this basis
 Especially when women have to have babies
 And babies make women more dependent
 Women are only from an evolutionary perspective
 Look at it logically
 Who has the ability to reach out for help at critical moments
 It’s no surprise that women make strong demands on men
 The problem is that women are more "high-married"
 Humans evolved more quickly than chimpanzees
 This selection pressure exerted by women on men
 Affected the development of our entire species
 Two things happened as far as I know
 Men compete for ability
 So the male hierarchy is a mechanism
 Push the best people to the top
 Is indeed the same as the meaning of the system itself
 Then its effect will be due to
 Women marry to the top of the ranks and doubly significant
 The most capable men are more likely to leave offspring
 This seems to be the reason for the expansion of our cortex
 This kind of expansion during the evolutionary period
 Happened very quickly
 "So the woman saw that the fruit of that tree was good for food
 "Also pleasing to the eyes and lovable
 "It can make people wise
 "Just pick the fruit and eat it
 "Give it to her husband and her husband to eat too" (Gen 3:6)
 Oh yes, women share food
 This is a very strange thing
 Because most creatures don’t share food
 If you are a wolf
 And gain something from the hunt
 You will fill yourself
 The leading animal will eat first
 If there is left
 Subordinate animals can also eat
 But humans are not like this
 We share food
 And you can imagine how this behavior evolved
 Many females share food with their children
 Understanding from the perspective of evolution
 It's not difficult
 Knowing that you are not just sharing food with your kids
 Like sharing with your partner
 This is another way for you to attract a spouse
 It’s like saying that we will be together better than living alone
 This is the part of sharing fruits
 What about the uncomfortable part
 This is part of the bargaining
 I will wake you up
 Partly because you need to be woken up
 Partly because I have a baby that needs to be taken care of
 So you better wake up
 In exchange I will give you some food
 In response we will form a team
 This is the agreement between people
 This is why we will more or less
 Practice monogamy
 Which is why we will more or less
 Pair and combine
 This is why this kind of marriage-like thing
 Universal to humans
 This exists in different cultural regions
 You can find exceptions but who cares
 Who really cares
 Look at this huge model
 Well, the result of having a bigger brain is
 We become very dependent
 And it took us a long time to adapt
 Because we need a relatively stable family bond
 This is basically what we have evolved
 It is impossible to achieve this without disturbing men
 For male creatures
 Why not let the female get pregnant and go away
 Really why
 This is what we need to consider
 Men abandon their children
 Not something difficult to understand
 But the man insisted on staying
 This is incomprehensible
 You just need to look at the animal kingdom
 The easiest and easiest thing
 Always the most likely to happen
 So those exceptional long-term commitments need to be explained
 "Just pick the fruit and eat it."
 "Give it to her husband and her husband to eat too" (Genesis 3:6)
 "The eyes of both of them brightened up" (Gen 3:7)
 Implied that they were closed before
 "I knew I was naked
 "Take the leaves of the fig tree
 "Weave a skirt for myself" (Genesis 3:7)
 This is so interesting
 Their eyes opened
 This shows that they are different from the beginning
 No matter what kind of people God created
 They were blind at first
 The blindness mentioned here is not blind in the usual sense
 They are not walking around in the Garden of Eden
 Hit the tree with one head
 But refers to "blindness" in the abstract sense
 This "blindness" is eliminated by what just happened
 What just happened
 At the same time make them aware that they are naked
 What does "bright eyes" mean
 What does it mean to know that you are naked?
 It means you realize that you are vulnerable
 What people found is this
 It's like saying
 We might get hurt like this
 It’s like you are one of a group of zebras
 There is a group of lions lying on the grass near here
 And you don't care
 Because they are lions lying down
 The lying lion is not a problem for you
 When he stands up
 It becomes a big problem when you are ready to hunt
 You are not smart enough to tell
 When the Lions lie down
 Stand up and start hunting
 So you didn’t build a fortress to keep the lion out
 You are just eating grass carelessly
 You are not alert
 But humans are different
 Humans awakened and they found
 I am vulnerable
 And it will always be so fragile and will follow you
 Human beings realize that their vulnerability is eternal
 What happened after
 The first thing they do is put on clothes
 When you are naked
 What do you do when you want to protect yourself from various threats
 Obviously look around you are all wearing clothes
 why?
 We did this for a long, long time
 At least since tens of thousands of years ago
 In fact, how much you can track
 When did clothing develop
 Because you can attach it to clothes instead of hair
 Of lice do DNA test
 We have a clear understanding of when clothing will appear
 Also know that there are different types of clothing
 This is amazing
 But the point is that Adam and Eve was naked at first
 It's not so good for them to think of this
 Because we are fragile
 Their eyes are already bright
 So they have self-awareness
 They found their vulnerability
 The first thing they did
 Took the first step of civilization
 Protect yourself with things that already exist in the world
 You protect yourself from the dangerous world
 Stay away from prying eyes
 This is Lynn Isbel's book
 A passage from "Why We See So Clear"
 "Temptation from Eve
 "To the mighty Thor was killed by the snake venom
 "The snake's figure always runs through
 "Over time and various cultures
 "It is considered a symbol of disaster and pain"
 "Snakes are notorious all over the world
 "Whether in religious mythology or folklore
 "All highlight our connection with snakes
 "But why
 "Since there are only a few of us
 "I have encountered a snake myself"
 "This book gives a surprising answer
 "The answer lies in the unique influence of snakes on the evolution of primates."
 "Isbel told us
 "The predation pressure of snakes on us
 "It makes us sharper vision and bigger brain
 "The ultimate reason
 "This may be the evolution of primates and humans
 "A crucial step"
 This has been proven recently
 Psychologists have known for a long time
 People’s fear of snakes can be acquired
 But they found that a group of primate neurons
 Thalamic-occipital neuron
 Has a special purpose
 This is a very old sensory system
 "The thalamus-occipital neuron group is neurobiologically confirmed
 "Our past evolution is to find snakes quickly"
 This is a 2013 study
 So the snake did wake us up
 Color vision is evolved by primates in order to adapt to eating fruits
 It seems that women want to attract men
 And it’s no coincidence to dress yourself up like a ripe fruit
 And this is not because of social culture
 "It's a cool breeze, the Lord God is walking in the garden
 "The man and his wife heard the voice of God
 "Hidden in the trees in the garden
 "Hide from the face of the Lord God" (Genesis 3:8)
 This passage is very interesting
 What is the meaning
 Before humanity awakens
 Before I found myself naked and vulnerable
 There is no need for humans to avoid God
 Are they now avoiding God?
 Are they naked and fragile
 Let's think about it
 Think about it
 Imagine you have the ability to live
 Sincere, brave and frank
 Let's imagine
 Then think about why you wouldn’t do that
 Is it because of fear and shame
 How they stop you
 Imagine we have been to a
 The idea of ​​being sincere, brave and frank is a bit similar to
 We already know from the story
 Walk with God in the Garden of Eden
 What prevents people from doing this
 What prevents people from hiding
 Because they found their shortcomings
 They looked at and felt
 If everything around me is a mess
 So a creature like me
 How to survive in this world
 Think about what you are avoiding
 You go home and sit on your own bed for five minutes
 Ask yourself what you are avoiding
 God will gradually appear in your mind
 Thousands of answers
 Now let's see why you are running away
 No doubt you are running away
 People are running away from this is nothing new
 This is the horror of this story
 Every morning we wake up and think
 Gosh look at this place
 There are many tricky troubles
 And we ourselves are in trouble
 And we failed to live what we should be
 So we hid
 This is what this story is about
 People wake up with self-awareness
 Found his own vulnerability
 This vulnerability keeps them in hiding
 In order to escape from fulfilling his sacred destiny
 Completely correct
 I really like this part of the story
 This part is very interesting,
 We can use this part to relax
 "Jehovah God called the man to say
 ""Where are you"" (Genesis 3:9)
 "He said, "I heard your voice in the garden
 "『I’m scared
 ""Because I am naked"" (Genesis 3:10)
 There is no doubt that this is why he hid
 ""I hid"" (Genesis 3:10)
 "The Lord said,'Who told you that you were naked
 "『Can you eat it?
 "'I told you not to eat
 ""The fruit on the tree?" (Genesis 3:11)
 This is the glorious moment of Adam after the "fall"
 "The man said, "That woman
 "『The woman you gave me to live with me
 "'She gave me the fruit from that tree,
 "'I'll eat it"' (Genesis 3:12)
 This is the sad man
 In addition, some modern feminists think
 The story of Adam and Eve
 Portray Eve as a villain against humanity
 Because she ate the forbidden fruit against the will of God
 Yes
 Looks like she fell first
 Seduced her husband again
 Make them all worse
 Of course Adam was so stupid that he ate it immediately
 This means
 She was braver than her husband and awakened first
 I think Adam is really in this story
 A sad creature
 Let’s review what he did in a few words
 First of all this is not what I did, it was given to me by Eve
 Then he blamed God
 "It's the woman you gave me"
 "She gave me the fruit and I ate it."
 It sounds like Adam is completely innocent
 Except now
 He is not only naked, rebellious and cowardly shameful
 He is still a crying slander behind his back
 He turned his back on Eve without hesitation
 I blamed God
 This is true
 You go online to see when men hold resentment against women
 Comments written on women
 So funny
 "It's not my fault, it's those little bitches who smashed"
 "It's not that I'm wrong, it's them"
 Not only that, they also blamed others
 This is exactly the same as the story shows
 Really sad and contemptible
 "The Lord God said to women
 "'What are you doing?'
 "The woman said
 ""The snake tempted me and I ate it" (Genesis 3:13)
 Well at least she has an excuse
 First it is a snake
 Actually
 We have already said that snakes are very cunning
 Secondly, the snake gradually evolved into Satan himself
 Very insidious and cunning
 So Eve fell into the snake trap
 This is indeed blameworthy
 But Biyadan’s excuse is so good that I don’t know where it is.
 "The Lord God said to the snake
 "『Since you did this
 "『You will be cursed
 "'More than all livestock and beasts
 "'You must walk on your belly
 ""Eat soil for life"" (Genesis 3:14)
 Incidentally
 A snake is a lizard without legs
 You should all understand
 "'I want you and the woman to be enemies
 "'Your descendants and women's descendants are also hostile to each other
 "'A woman's descendant will hurt your head
 "'You will hurt his heel'" (Genesis 3:15)
 I like these two paintings very much
 Exquisite
 By the way
 Regardless of the religious background
 What do you see
 The eternal mother holds her child
 Protect him from snakes
 See it right below the picture
 Crocodile snake
 These are the animals that have preyed on us for the past 600,000 years
 It’s the protection of the mother of eternity that keeps us alive today
 That's why this is a sacred painting
 I prefer the picture on the right
 It looks like the moon below
 Eve stepped on this reptile
 This form is very old
 I may have shown it to you before
 But I think this is really great
 She emerged from a ring in the sky
 This symbolizes eternal reincarnation in her
 you can say so
 This eternal reincarnation
 Is a prototype
 It implies that she is being born
 Behind this are some musical instruments
 What the painter wants to show is
 The intricacies of the great life forms of life
 Protect our mother from being born from the background
 Protect the child forever
 Keep them from being prey
 How can this not be a sacred sight
 If you don't think so
 Then it's not a matter of painting
 It's your problem
 "To the woman again" (Genesis 3:16)
 Now God just lists the consequences of stealing the forbidden fruit
 As if you were asleep
 After you wake up
 These things will happen
 "'I will increase your pain of pregnancy
 "'You have to suffer more when you give birth to children
 "'You must adore your husband
 ""Your husband will rule you"" (Genesis 3:16)
 God still didn't say he should
 But that he is going to
 why
 "You will suffer more when you give birth to children" (Genesis 3:16)
 When your brain evolves big enough
 You will find
 Having a baby is never easy anymore
 And then people created something
 Something based on faith
 This can be said to be one of the curses to humans
 So this is the punishment Eve received for awakening
 "Said to Adam
 "『Since you obeyed your wife,
 "'Eat the fruit of the tree that I told you not to eat
 "'The earth will be cursed for your sake
 "'You will toil for life
 ""You can eat from the ground"" (Genesis 3:17)
 What does this passage mean
 This is the emergence of the concept of "work"
 "'The earth will give you thorns and thistles
 "'You also want to eat the vegetables in the field'" (Genesis 3:18)
 It defines the concept of work
 What is the difference between human behavior and animals
 jobs
 What does work mean
 Means you sacrifice the present for the future
 Why people do this
 Because they are aware of their vulnerability
 They have awakened
 Since then
 Humans can never go back to the subconscious heaven
 I don’t care how many problems you solve to make sure
 Pingshun today
 No matter how much work you do
 New problems will follow
 You can never work until they are completely resolved
 Everything you do now is in fear of the future
 This is the price of awakening
 This is Paradise Lost
 Human history begins
 This is what this story is going to tell us
 "'You must be sweaty to make ends meet
 "'Until you return
 "『Because you came from the soil
 "『You are dust
 ""Return to the dust" (Genesis 3:19)
 "Adam named his wife Eve
 "Because she is the mother of all beings" (Genesis 3:20)
 "Jehovah God for Adam and his wife
 "Use leather to make clothes for
 "Wear them" (Genesis 3:21)
 By the way, this was painted by William Blake
 "The Lord God says
 "『That person is already similar to us
 "『Can know good and evil
 "'I'm afraid he reaches out now
 "'Pick the fruit of the tree of life and eat
 ""Live forever"" (Genesis 3:22)
 I'll talk about these two pictures next week
 "The Lord God sent him out of the Garden of Eden
 "Cultivate the soil from which he came from" (Genesis 3:23)
 "So kicked him out
 "Again east of the Garden of Eden
 "Set up cherubim and a flaming sword turning around
 "Keep guarding the path of the tree of life" (Genesis 3:24)
 Let's talk a little bit more
 I think this is why
 Adam and Eve were tempted by a snake
 So I ate the forbidden fruit
 Wake them up
 They realized that they were naked
 Realize that I am vulnerable
 Aware of the future
 Realized that I will die
 Realize that I have to work
 Realized the difficulty of fertility
 Ever since lost the subconscious garden of Eden
 All of this makes sense
 But what is the perception of good and evil
 What does the knowledge of good and evil mean to them
 In Mesopotamian mythology
 Goddess of Chaos, Diamat, according to what she can imagine
 Worst monster image
 Created mankind with Jin Gu's blood
 Their thoughts are in the deepest part of human nature
 There are cracks ripped by the devil
 This is what they think
 These stories are all born in a similar context
 So open your eyes
 Aware of their vulnerability
 What does it have to do with the knowledge of good and evil?
 I thought about it very seriously
 I must say
 I thought about it for 20 years
 Because I know there is something in these stories
 I can't unify them
 at the same time
 I am also reading the literature
 I want to tell you an unfortunate fact
 If you need high-energy warning
 I will give you one now
 Trust me
 I never give people warning easily
 The things I want to tell you you will never forget
 This is what Unit 731 did in China
 731 was a Japanese army during World War II
 What i know is
 During the Second World War
 Did something pretty creepy
 Really outrageous
 What they do is
 Gather the prisoners in one place
 Hold their arms completely
 Then take the captive out
 Pour boiling water on the captive's arm
 Repeat this until the captive is separated
 They claim to do this for research
 "How to heal soldiers' frostbite"
 Unless you want to have a nightmare
 Don't care about Unit 731
 This is Unit 731
 This is human
 Someone patted his head and came up with this idea
 Some people implemented it recklessly
 What is the knowledge of good and evil
 This is the point
 You know you are vulnerable
 No other animal knows
 You know what will hurt you
 Now that you know you are vulnerable and what will hurt you
 You know what can hurt others
 Once you know what can hurt others
 You can use the method of hurting others
 Because you can distinguish good from evil
 Snakes are really tricky
 Because of something
 If we know the result in advance
 We might not want to try
 But once humans have self-awareness
 Aware of his nakedness
 He has the ability to do evil
 From here on this situation is known to the world
 The rest of the story is
 There are already snakes in the world, right
 If you are a primate living in a tree
 You know snakes can prey on primates
 It's bad
 So you want to stay alert to snakes
 So your brain grows
 You can think about it
 There are more than just snakes on the tree
 The tree is where the snake lives
 Why don't we get down from the tree
 Hunt them and then
 Get rid of them
 They are kind of like potential snakes
 So the snake becomes a potential snake
 The loop you use to handle this is the same
 You have to get rid of the snake
 Just like St. Patrick drove the snake out of Ireland
 No more snakes
 Here is heaven
 No no no no
 Things will not develop like this
 You find someone has become a snake
 Suppose you live in a tribe
 You will have hostile tribes
 You have to protect yourself from them, right
 Maybe your power has grown
 You defeated all the enemies
 What will happen next
 Snakes will appear from within you
 Even if you eliminate all external enemies
 Built a big city
 The enemy will continue to emerge from within you
 The snake not only represents the snake in the Garden of Eden
 Not just a realistic snake
 Not just your enemy
 Snake may be your friend
 Because your friend might betray you
 There is something worse than this
 You might betray yourself
 Even if you get rid of all the snakes outside
 You yourself are always a snake that cannot be eliminated
 No one knows why
 This is why Christians want to put
 The snake in the Garden of Eden is connected with Satan
 How clever this is
 Think about it
 Who is my enemy
 Yes it's a snake
 But you have to know if you are
 Primates inhabiting trees are good for you
 You are one after 6 million years
 Precision humans born with extra evolution
 You spent a lot of effort to solve
 "What is the greatest enemy of mankind?"
 Human nature is inherently evil
 This is the symbol of Satan
 This symbol means
 Just like there are logos in the world
 The truth at the beginning of time
 Summoned from the chaos
 There is also an opposing spirit in the world
 An anti-purpose brother
 Like Cain did to Abel
 We will talk about this next week
 It's all against you
 This opposing spirit is completely
 Driven by evil beliefs and desire for destruction
 It has a reason to act
 This is the content of the next story
 The story of Cain and Abel is in a paragraph
 Except for the weird claims of Christian mystics
 This opposing spirit began to appear for the first time
 It and the serpent of eden
 Have identity with the initiator of all evil
