<p begin="00:02:00.040" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">influenced by all of them although he</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.960" end="00:02:09.329" style="s2">will eventually give priority to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:14.680" style="s2">Christianity and that&#39;s Augustine so</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.329" end="00:02:17.290" style="s2">Augustine is a Roman and he&#39;s alive -</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.680" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">and the 4th century into the beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.290" end="00:02:22.300" style="s2">of the fifth century as the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:26.140" style="s2">is entering its final stages so as you</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:38.180" style="s2">very dark vision of the world and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.909" end="00:02:41.299" style="s2">that reason Augustine is attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.180" end="00:02:47.260" style="s2">manic any ISM now this is a religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.299" end="00:02:51.349" style="s2">that was started by many from Persia and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.260" end="00:02:53.450" style="s2">many people argue that it is a gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.349" end="00:02:55.549" style="s2">religion some people disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.450" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">applying the term Gnostics to it again</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.549" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:05.889" style="s2">it was seems to have picked up on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:08.870" style="s2">of the same kinds of ideas about a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.889" end="00:03:10.669" style="s2">machinery in which we are meshed as</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.870" end="00:03:12.950" style="s2">creatures of light and that light has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.669" end="00:03:18.109" style="s2">be liberated by a special kind of gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:20.450" style="s2">and and Augustine is deeply attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.109" end="00:03:24.439" style="s2">this religion he&#39;s attracted to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.450" end="00:03:27.709" style="s2">religion precisely because it is as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.439" end="00:03:32.690" style="s2">said it has Gnostic components in it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.709" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">therefore promises to address his own</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.690" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">personal loss of agency which I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:41.090" style="s2">about momentarily but also to address</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:44.120" style="s2">what is becoming more and more salient</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.090" end="00:03:50.209" style="s2">to people of Augustine&#39;s time which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.120" end="00:03:52.579" style="s2">world that is darkening around them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.209" end="00:03:57.139" style="s2">he&#39;s influenced by that which means</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.579" end="00:04:00.680" style="s2">ideas of evil and evil powers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.139" end="00:04:09.500" style="s2">structures in the world are very salient</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.680" end="00:04:12.769" style="s2">to Augustine he also deeply suffers as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.500" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">mentioned personally he is riven with</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.769" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">inner conflict to put it I think in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:25.699" style="s2">terms that would make sense to us today</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">Augustine is a sex addict he is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.699" end="00:04:31.729" style="s2">addicted to sexual behavior he described</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.669" style="s2">it this way and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.729" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">particularly apt way of describing his</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.669" end="00:04:39.620" style="s2">addiction he said I was always licking</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.210" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">the open</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:47.630" style="s2">or of lust which gives you a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:49.760" style="s2">telling image of a compelling desire and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.630" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">yet and something disgusting and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.760" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">degrading and it&#39;s also exacerbating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:57.760" style="s2">making worse the very affliction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">you&#39;re suffering so he he suffers</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.760" end="00:05:10.780" style="s2">tremendous self-loathing because of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:15.110" style="s2">tremendous loss of agency and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.780" end="00:05:20.449" style="s2">struggles to try and find a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.110" end="00:05:24.490" style="s2">getting free from his own personal inner</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.449" end="00:05:28.010" style="s2">conflict and degradation and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.490" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">providing an answer to the evil that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.010" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">sees in the world he writes the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:36.050" style="s2">autobiography in the history of the West</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.380" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">the confessions and in there he relates</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.050" end="00:05:40.729" style="s2">an experience which deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">affected him I would say it came close</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.729" end="00:05:46.849" style="s2">to traumatizing him so when he was young</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:50.419" style="s2">he relates this story he and some of his</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.849" end="00:05:55.460" style="s2">friends broke into a courtyard and stole</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.419" end="00:05:57.470" style="s2">some fruit and you&#39;re thinking most of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.460" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">us would think yeah you know a young</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.470" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">adolescent performing you know a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.110" end="00:06:05.240" style="s2">misdemeanor act of minor theft stealing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">some fruit who cares but this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.240" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">Augustine he&#39;s already a meshed in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">Manichaean worldview he&#39;s already deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:16.099" style="s2">sort of he&#39;s becoming aware as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:18.410" style="s2">adolescent of how powerful his drives</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.099" end="00:06:21.590" style="s2">can be and what affected Augustine about</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.410" end="00:06:25.760" style="s2">this very profoundly as he said he did</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.590" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">not want the fruit do not desire the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.760" end="00:06:32.300" style="s2">fruit he wasn&#39;t really trying to impress</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:35.050" style="s2">his friends he wasn&#39;t desiring that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.300" end="00:06:37.760" style="s2">came away with a very strong experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a reverse of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.760" end="00:06:41.570" style="s2">state of consciousness he came away with</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">a very strong experience that he stole</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.570" end="00:06:47.479" style="s2">the fruit simply because it was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:49.849" style="s2">wrong thing to do that he wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.479" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">this that was something in him that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.849" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">dragging him down</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:57.289" style="s2">and this is again why this worldview</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:07:00.259" style="s2">appealed to him there was there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.289" end="00:07:02.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like again Manichean ism is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.259" end="00:07:03.979" style="s2">much like the Star Wars mythology of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.090" end="00:07:06.590" style="s2">light and the dark side there is a dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.979" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">side and it&#39;s drawing people down and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.590" end="00:07:16.669" style="s2">it&#39;s the side of desire and anger and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">destruction right and Augustine sees</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.669" end="00:07:22.909" style="s2">this alive within his own body in his</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.580" end="00:07:25.099" style="s2">sexual addiction so he travels around</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.909" end="00:07:28.759" style="s2">the world he teaches rhetoric and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.099" end="00:07:33.529" style="s2">becomes eventually connected and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.759" end="00:07:36.529" style="s2">familiar with philosophy and something</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.529" end="00:07:41.210" style="s2">happens to him that&#39;s quite profound he</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.529" end="00:07:43.999" style="s2">reads the work of Latinas he reads the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:46.270" style="s2">work of plutinos he has very high</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.999" end="00:07:50.089" style="s2">opinion of Latinas he later writes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.270" end="00:07:55.339" style="s2">Latinas Plato lived again and he writes</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.089" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">very glowingly of the plate myths and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.339" end="00:08:03.439" style="s2">Plato and especially in plutinos</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">Augustine sees a different way he gets a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.439" end="00:08:08.990" style="s2">world view other than the Manichaean</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:12.789" style="s2">world view he gets the naplan the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.990" end="00:08:17.289" style="s2">Neoplatonic world view and he gets it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.789" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">mean this in the gnosis sense he gets it</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.289" end="00:08:30.349" style="s2">Augustine has a mystical experience well</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:33.589" style="s2">reading Latinas he has that ascent up to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.349" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2">the one he rises through the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.589" end="00:08:38.930" style="s2">reality and levels of his self and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:43.250" style="s2">has this mystical experience but he</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.930" end="00:08:46.279" style="s2">can&#39;t hold it he can&#39;t stay there the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.250" end="00:08:49.459" style="s2">the darkness in him is so has so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.279" end="00:08:54.190" style="s2">gravity pulls him back down and pulls</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.459" end="00:08:58.430" style="s2">him back towards that world of lust and</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.490" end="00:10:50.270" style="s2">so he&#39;s falling into despair and he&#39;s at</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.110" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">backyard like the courtyard and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.140" end="00:11:04.010" style="s2">listening and he hears a child&#39;s voice</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:06.589" style="s2">say take it pick up and read and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.010" end="00:11:08.630" style="s2">a Bible there or an early version of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.589" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">Bible and he picks it up just where it</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.630" end="00:11:17.470" style="s2">is and he happens to of course read the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">work of Paul and in Paul he finds an</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.470" end="00:11:24.050" style="s2">affinity a deep affinity that kindred</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:27.350" style="s2">spirit because in Paul he sees that same</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.050" end="00:11:29.899" style="s2">inner conflict that same tortured inner</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.350" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">conflict and he sees a worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.899" end="00:11:41.959" style="s2">makes sense of that inner conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:43.070" style="s2">Augustine has this insight he says look</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.959" end="00:11:45.110" style="s2">look look</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.070" end="00:11:47.410" style="s2">pay attention to Platonists pay</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.110" end="00:11:49.790" style="s2">attention to Plato what are they saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.410" end="00:11:51.800" style="s2">Plato and Platonists are ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.790" end="00:11:54.440" style="s2">saying we&#39;re driven by two powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.800" end="00:11:58.730" style="s2">loves word riveting driven by the love</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.440" end="00:12:01.579" style="s2">of becoming one within and becoming one</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.730" end="00:12:09.740" style="s2">with what is most real just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.579" end="00:12:11.660" style="s2">driving all of our reason is love a love</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.740" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">that a love for what&#39;s true a love for</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.660" end="00:12:23.540" style="s2">what&#39;s good a love for what is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:28.640" style="s2">and then he says at the heart of reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.540" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">is love and what&#39;s damaged in me is my</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.640" end="00:12:36.020" style="s2">capacity to love not my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">reason that&#39;s why I have this sexual</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.020" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">addiction my capacity for love has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">thwarted and twisted by my sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.440" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">so I need something that can heal</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.010" end="00:12:59.800" style="s2">remember the gnosis the healing I need</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:13:02.650" style="s2">to be healed there&#39;s a love that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.800" end="00:13:05.950" style="s2">within reason that can help you grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.650" end="00:13:14.220" style="s2">beyond reason - what reason always</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.950" end="00:13:17.770" style="s2">sought how do we grow in love</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.220" end="00:13:20.980" style="s2">well agape that&#39;s what the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.770" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">message is agape by participating in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.980" end="00:13:28.350" style="s2">agape we grow in love we grow in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:34.960" style="s2">love that is driving us to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.350" end="00:13:38.440" style="s2">persons fully realized persons so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.960" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">Augustine says Neoplatonism needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.440" end="00:13:43.780" style="s2">Christianity and the healing and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:45.670" style="s2">response to evil that Gnosticism was</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.780" end="00:13:48.640" style="s2">looking for can actually be found in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:58.930" style="s2">Christianity and so he synthesizes them</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.640" end="00:14:00.730" style="s2">all together so notice what we now have</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.930" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">let&#39;s put this together very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.730" end="00:14:05.080" style="s2">in Augustine and notice the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:06.610" style="s2">putting it he&#39;s not putting it out there</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.080" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">as a theory he&#39;s writing an</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.610" end="00:14:12.520" style="s2">autobiography he&#39;s talking about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:14.650" style="s2">perspectival and participatory way he</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.520" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">writes the first autobiography the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.650" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">confessions this is not a dry academic</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:27.250" style="s2">treatise this is an existential manual</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:29.710" style="s2">how you can also go through the process</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.250" end="00:14:35.140" style="s2">that he has gone through it is gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.710" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">through and through okay so from</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.140" end="00:14:39.640" style="s2">plutinos what do we have well Platonists</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:44.940" style="s2">already has given us because part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.640" end="00:14:44.940" style="s2">plutinos is the Aristotelian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.510" end="00:14:55.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the Noma logical order we talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:58.190" style="s2">about right the conformity theory right</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.970" end="00:15:01.639" style="s2">the geocentric worldview the two things</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.190" end="00:15:05.089" style="s2">in attunement they say is your this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.639" end="00:15:08.029" style="s2">the best science account of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.089" end="00:15:12.889" style="s2">structure of reality and how reality is</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.029" end="00:15:14.990" style="s2">known from platini&#39;s himself we get now</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.889" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to call the normative</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.990" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">order so Tinus gave us an account of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:27.260" style="s2">we can move in a coordinated fashion up</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">the levels of reality up the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.260" end="00:15:33.620" style="s2">consciousness up the levels of the self</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:39.019" style="s2">from what is less real to what is more</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.620" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">real what&#39;s Augustine going to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.019" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">that well look what&#39;s less real what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:48.670" style="s2">down here has less oneness less</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">integration it makes less sense look if</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.670" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">when I destroy something what do I do I</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:58.089" style="s2">take away its structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:16:02.529" style="s2">organization I make it more disordered</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.089" end="00:16:05.480" style="s2">right as I go downward things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.529" end="00:16:10.459" style="s2">fragmenting becoming having less and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.480" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">less form less and less i daus they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.459" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">less and less intelligible they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:25.699" style="s2">and less understandable this becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:28.970" style="s2">more and more pure chaos I&#39;m losing</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.699" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">truth I&#39;m losing goodness I&#39;m losing</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.970" end="00:16:35.750" style="s2">beauty I&#39;m losing what makes things to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">be and what makes them to be sensible</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.750" end="00:16:46.430" style="s2">and intelligible this is evil down here</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:50.920" style="s2">is that that&#39;s the whole that&#39;s the tear</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.430" end="00:16:54.380" style="s2">in being towards which things can fall</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.920" end="00:16:58.810" style="s2">but I can also move up to what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.380" end="00:17:03.760" style="s2">true more good more real</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.810" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">and of course what Platonists knows is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.760" end="00:17:09.910" style="s2">that this is driven by a love a love to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.939" end="00:17:11.890" style="s2">love of knowing what it&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.910" end="00:17:18.699" style="s2">simultaneously becoming what is more</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.890" end="00:17:21.550" style="s2">real and so for Augustine this of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.699" end="00:17:26.439" style="s2">and Plato even called it if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.550" end="00:17:28.510" style="s2">the good this is the normative order the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.439" end="00:17:31.420" style="s2">normal logical order tells you how</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.510" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">things are structured the normative</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.420" end="00:17:37.000" style="s2">order tells you how you can become</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.090" end="00:17:42.010" style="s2">better how you can deal with evil and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.000" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">how you can increase realness meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.010" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.290" end="00:17:52.980" style="s2">Augustine takes that and as I&#39;ve shown</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.690" end="00:17:55.330" style="s2">you it says wait the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.980" end="00:17:57.490" style="s2">Aristotle is well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.330" end="00:18:00.190" style="s2">everything was moving to get where it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.490" end="00:18:02.950" style="s2">belongs all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.190" end="00:18:05.380" style="s2">but that&#39;s all it is in Aristotle but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.950" end="00:18:08.650" style="s2">think Augustine is basically saying that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.380" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">everything is moving in a way in order</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.650" end="00:18:13.810" style="s2">to try and move us away from evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">towards goodness and so he says I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.810" end="00:18:21.220" style="s2">Christianity puts these two together the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:26.490" style="s2">world everything is moving on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.220" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">and the purpose is to try and afford</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.490" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">realization both cognitive and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.920" end="00:18:36.730" style="s2">world things are becoming more real</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.100" end="00:26:56.359" style="s2">part of the way I can start to answer</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.480" end="00:32:24.460" style="s2">in reading how people read right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.820" end="00:32:26.259" style="s2">it&#39;s after the schism so before that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.460" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">this is something I can speak to from</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.259" end="00:32:33.610" style="s2">first person before that reading is done</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">largely aloud people read aloud they</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.610" end="00:32:36.490" style="s2">read the Bible for example because</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:38.529" style="s2">that&#39;s mostly the only thing that can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.490" end="00:32:42.220" style="s2">read and some of the church fathers</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.529" end="00:32:46.269" style="s2">people like Augustine for example the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.220" end="00:32:48.369" style="s2">read aloud reading is often done</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.269" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">communally so first of all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.369" end="00:32:53.350" style="s2">embedded in a cultural context you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:54.999" style="s2">embedded in a central community you read</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.350" end="00:33:02.919" style="s2">aloud and more than you read aloud</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.999" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">you&#39;re reciting so let&#39;s try and get</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.919" end="00:33:08.379" style="s2">something in your experience that might</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:10.179" style="s2">bring this out okay think of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.379" end="00:33:14.529" style="s2">difference between reading a poem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.179" end="00:33:16.869" style="s2">reciting a poem and it&#39;s no coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.529" end="00:33:18.909" style="s2">by the way that when Gabriel spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.869" end="00:33:21.880" style="s2">Muhammad he told him to recite not to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.909" end="00:33:24.990" style="s2">write okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.880" end="00:33:28.600" style="s2">what happens when you I was something</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.990" end="00:33:32.500" style="s2">wonderful last Saturday was my birthday</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.600" end="00:33:36.070" style="s2">and so it was a surprise party my</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.500" end="00:33:38.680" style="s2">partner she organized a wonderful party</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.070" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">for me and I&#39;d always said that instead</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.680" end="00:33:42.820" style="s2">of gifts I would prefer it if people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:44.590" style="s2">brought one of their favorite pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.820" end="00:33:47.680" style="s2">poetry and read it aloud so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.590" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">poetry party and people read it aloud</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.680" end="00:33:52.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s such a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:33:55.180" style="s2">reading a poem silently and reading it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.570" end="00:33:57.010" style="s2">aloud because the intonation and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.180" end="00:33:58.690" style="s2">sharing it with others makes it very</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.010" end="00:34:02.470" style="s2">different what was a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.690" end="00:34:04.540" style="s2">beautiful is my girlfriend actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.470" end="00:34:07.240" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s a gifted singer she actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.540" end="00:34:09.429" style="s2">sang her version of the poem by Robert</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.240" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">Frost it&#39;s a famous one about the two</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.429" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">roads diverging and I took the road less</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">traveled by and that has made all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:20.050" style="s2">difference but when somebody is singing</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:22.270" style="s2">a song singing a poem and most songs are</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.050" end="00:34:26.379" style="s2">poems if you if you think about it right</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.270" end="00:34:32.020" style="s2">it is appealing to you not just</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.379" end="00:34:33.790" style="s2">propositional e it&#39;s not just write that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.020" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">kind of knowing it&#39;s not just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.790" end="00:34:38.980" style="s2">create beliefs in you first of all by</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:41.409" style="s2">reciting the poem right you you and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.980" end="00:34:42.790" style="s2">trying to communicate it to others you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.409" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">have to bring in all your know-how of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.790" end="00:34:50.110" style="s2">communication being able to share with</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:52.060" style="s2">other people you have to know all your</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.060" end="00:34:57.129" style="s2">embodied there&#39;s a perspectival stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.120" end="00:35:00.430" style="s2">what does it feel like what is it like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.129" end="00:35:01.210" style="s2">to be here in this space in this context</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.430" end="00:35:07.360" style="s2">with these people</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.850" end="00:37:44.070" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is people are shifting</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.860" end="00:37:46.410" style="s2">from right so have a Cinna which is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.070" end="00:37:51.840" style="s2">anglicized form of Benson who&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.410" end="00:37:54.180" style="s2">Persian philosopher he was up until this</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.840" end="00:37:56.700" style="s2">time very the dominant interpreter of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.180" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">that ERISA that Augustinian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.700" end="00:38:03.870" style="s2">that whole Augustinian way and he gives</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.330" end="00:38:07.140" style="s2">priority to the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.870" end="00:38:10.290" style="s2">and Corbin is going to make a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.140" end="00:38:12.450" style="s2">fact that Persian philosophy was always</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.290" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">trying to keep the neo platonic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.450" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">Gnostic elements of spirituality alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:21.810" style="s2">Persia has played a much greater role in</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:25.110" style="s2">world history and cultural history than</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.810" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">we have properly given credit to in the</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:43.460" style="s2">by Averroes right and Averroes</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.940" end="00:38:47.690" style="s2">is more purely purely Aristotelian and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.460" end="00:38:54.330" style="s2">what that really means is a shift a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.690" end="00:38:57.060" style="s2">shift to giving exclusive priority to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.330" end="00:39:01.260" style="s2">definitions remember Aristotle try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.060" end="00:39:04.500" style="s2">understand essences the I das as Evans</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.260" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">essences and essences as definitions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.500" end="00:39:08.760" style="s2">that&#39;s very problematic as many things</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:11.160" style="s2">don&#39;t have definitions but definitions</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.760" end="00:39:15.420" style="s2">and propositions so people now start to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.160" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">read silently to themselves and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.420" end="00:39:22.020" style="s2">they&#39;re trying what they give priority</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:24.270" style="s2">to right is coherence within a language</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.020" end="00:39:26.730" style="s2">rather than transformation within</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.270" end="00:39:30.420" style="s2">themselves in the world so what matters</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.730" end="00:39:32.490" style="s2">is how the various symbols and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.420" end="00:39:36.780" style="s2">mean that in a spiritual sense the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.490" end="00:39:40.790" style="s2">various propositional terms and logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.780" end="00:39:40.790" style="s2">connectives fit together coherently</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.020" end="00:39:52.790" style="s2">so a new model for thought emerges see</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.790" end="00:39:57.290" style="s2">the old model was thought is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.790" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">conforming to the world and and then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.290" end="00:40:02.089" style="s2">get this this we got this articulated</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">and developed and expanded into this</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.089" end="00:40:10.609" style="s2">whole process of gnosis and an agog a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:12.530" style="s2">and self transformation that model of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.609" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">knowing that&#39;s also a way of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.530" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s also a way of becoming that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:24.470" style="s2">being taken away and it&#39;s being replaced</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:26.750" style="s2">by a different model thought knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.470" end="00:40:30.950" style="s2">to have coherent propositional language</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.750" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">thinking is to have a coherent set of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.950" end="00:40:35.690" style="s2">propositions in your head so Kranz talks</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:38.510" style="s2">about we shift from the extensive self</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.690" end="00:40:42.410" style="s2">the self that is transacted li connected</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.510" end="00:40:46.609" style="s2">to the world that understands itself in</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.410" end="00:40:52.430" style="s2">terms of its conformity to the world to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.609" end="00:40:56.390" style="s2">right and the intensive self this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.430" end="00:41:00.890" style="s2">self that&#39;s inside my head it&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.390" end="00:41:04.490" style="s2">my beliefs my self is primarily the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.890" end="00:41:09.050" style="s2">I talk to myself by affirming my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.490" end="00:41:15.650" style="s2">through propositional language so people</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.050" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">start to think that the primary way in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.650" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">which we know things is to get as much</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:31.150" style="s2">coherence within our inner language then</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:36.589" style="s2">instead of conformity in our outer</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.150" end="00:41:41.060" style="s2">existential modes now why would people</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.589" end="00:41:46.700" style="s2">make this shift people make this shift</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.060" end="00:41:48.920" style="s2">because the world is starting to open up</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.700" end="00:41:51.880" style="s2">again people are starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.920" end="00:41:53.250" style="s2">interested in knowing the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.880" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.250" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">we&#39;re getting its and it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:02.940" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s just slowly beginning here</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:11.400" style="s2">right but we&#39;re gonna get the move</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.940" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">towards the value of having and by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.400" end="00:42:17.940" style="s2">way I believe in this value I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.940" end="00:42:24.840" style="s2">coherent well-organized propositional</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:31.890" style="s2">theories the power of this is being</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.840" end="00:42:34.349" style="s2">discovered so when I can read in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.890" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">other way right</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.349" end="00:42:43.290" style="s2">I can empower my argumentative skills</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:46.710" style="s2">tremendously what I&#39;m losing right what</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.290" end="00:42:50.250" style="s2">I&#39;m losing is I&#39;m losing reading as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.710" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">psycho technology of psycho-spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.250" end="00:42:55.140" style="s2">existential transformation reading is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:58.980" style="s2">now becoming the consumption of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.140" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">propositions and they&#39;re structuring in</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.980" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">logical coherency why</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.890" end="00:43:15.339" style="s2">well as I said there&#39;s the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.309" end="00:43:17.739" style="s2">this reorientation towards the external</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.339" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">world and it&#39;s being driven by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.739" end="00:43:25.239" style="s2">that Aristotle is coming into prominence</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:31.539" style="s2">because he&#39;s being rediscovered so</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.239" end="00:43:33.640" style="s2">because of the Crusades there is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.539" end="00:43:38.230" style="s2">rediscovery of the works of Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.640" end="00:43:47.519" style="s2">that had largely been lost to Western</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.230" end="00:43:52.539" style="s2">Europe and in Aristotle there is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.519" end="00:43:57.099" style="s2">problem for Christianity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.539" end="00:44:01.559" style="s2">problem for Christianity the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.099" end="00:44:05.049" style="s2">we have a figure that can&#39;t be ignored</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.559" end="00:44:08.039" style="s2">Aristotle is is part of that whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.049" end="00:44:10.569" style="s2">ancient world that Augustine gave us</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.039" end="00:44:13.420" style="s2">he&#39;s the author of the Noma logical</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.569" end="00:44:18.069" style="s2">order that Augustine has baptized with</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.420" end="00:44:20.259" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s approval so aerosol can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.069" end="00:44:25.539" style="s2">be ignored but Aristotle describes a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.259" end="00:44:27.690" style="s2">world that does not have a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.539" end="00:44:30.489" style="s2">Christian mythology attached to it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.690" end="00:44:34.769" style="s2">offers explanations for things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.489" end="00:44:34.769" style="s2">Christianity makes no effort to explain</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.019" end="00:44:46.569" style="s2">so there is this tremendous attraction</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.489" end="00:44:49.749" style="s2">to the power the new explanatory power</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.569" end="00:44:53.170" style="s2">provided by Aristotle and the model he</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.749" end="00:44:55.630" style="s2">gives of getting clear definitions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.170" end="00:44:59.499" style="s2">clear syllogistic inferences and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.630" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">building up a very clear picture is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.499" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">meshed with this new way of reading and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.230" end="00:45:07.739" style="s2">this new way of experiencing knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:13.859" style="s2">experiencing oneself primarily inside</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.739" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">one&#39;s head inside one&#39;s language so</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.859" end="00:45:21.390" style="s2">Aristotle can&#39;t be ignored or rejected</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:24.760" style="s2">because of his eminent Authority</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.390" end="00:45:28.450" style="s2">but neither can he simply be assimilated</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.760" end="00:45:31.060" style="s2">into the Christian worldview because he</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.450" end="00:45:33.460" style="s2">talks about and explains things and does</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.060" end="00:45:41.950" style="s2">things in a manner that you don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.460" end="00:45:43.570" style="s2">in the Bible so more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.950" end="00:45:46.329" style="s2">reading in this new way they&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.570" end="00:45:50.050" style="s2">to emulate the new right Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.329" end="00:45:56.740" style="s2">science but this is starting to cause a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.050" end="00:45:59.560" style="s2">crisis within Christianity and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.740" end="00:46:04.650" style="s2">there&#39;s an individual who arises who</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.560" end="00:46:08.740" style="s2">sees the looming threat that this poses</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.650" end="00:46:10.540" style="s2">who sees two things happening there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.740" end="00:46:18.210" style="s2">change in the psycho technology of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.540" end="00:46:22.859" style="s2">reading and there is a change and how</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.210" end="00:46:22.859" style="s2">people are starting to look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.079" end="00:46:32.109" style="s2">both of these changes are associated</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.089" end="00:46:34.390" style="s2">with the difficulty of assimilating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.109" end="00:46:39.160" style="s2">rediscovered Aristotle into a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.390" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">worldview the Thomas Aquinas takes up</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.160" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">the task of solving this problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:47.829" style="s2">he&#39;s going to be a pivotal figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">precisely for that reason now again</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.290" end="00:47:01.569" style="s2">and there&#39;s all kinds of controversy</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.910" end="00:47:06.220" style="s2">around you know how Aristotelian aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.569" end="00:47:09.010" style="s2">is how platonic he is right I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.220" end="00:47:12.609" style="s2">again try and present the way I think he</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.010" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">was historically taken up and basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.609" end="00:47:23.890" style="s2">understood so</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:29.930" style="s2">for the coin it&#39;s how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.890" end="00:47:33.110" style="s2">salvage both the Christian worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.930" end="00:47:36.770" style="s2">the new science the new science of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.110" end="00:47:39.260" style="s2">rediscovered Aristotle he he does</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.770" end="00:47:41.270" style="s2">something really brilliant he goes to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.260" end="00:47:43.160" style="s2">the fundamental grammar of all of us</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.270" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the fundamental grammar of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.160" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">it&#39;s the mythology of the two worlds the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:51.080" style="s2">axial revolution is there&#39;s two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">there&#39;s the real world and the illusory</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.080" end="00:47:59.420" style="s2">world right and that has been a constant</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:48:02.690" style="s2">throat all of this and he comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.420" end="00:48:05.360" style="s2">a way of trying to assimilate it right</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.690" end="00:48:09.350" style="s2">so we have the two worlds right you</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.360" end="00:48:12.290" style="s2">seriously in Plato in the Platonic and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.350" end="00:48:15.110" style="s2">even in the Augustinian here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.290" end="00:48:23.540" style="s2">everyday world right and then here is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.110" end="00:48:29.450" style="s2">the real world but what Aquinas does is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.540" end="00:48:37.700" style="s2">he changes that he says this world is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.450" end="00:48:43.160" style="s2">real too there is real knowledge of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.700" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">world possible this is knowledge that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.160" end="00:48:49.160" style="s2">can get through reason and science so</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:51.460" style="s2">reason in science study this world this</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.160" end="00:48:51.460" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.250" end="00:49:04.690" style="s2">and they can discover real truths about</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.580" end="00:49:10.430" style="s2">that through reason through science but</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.690" end="00:49:14.300" style="s2">this world up here is still somehow more</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.430" end="00:49:15.410" style="s2">real how do we do that well he invents a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.300" end="00:49:18.020" style="s2">distinction that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.410" end="00:49:19.640" style="s2">anachronistically push back on people</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.020" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">before and there and there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.640" end="00:49:23.000" style="s2">definitely precursors in</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:26.450" style="s2">pseudo-dionysius and Augustine but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.000" end="00:49:30.700" style="s2">idea is this is the natural world that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.450" end="00:49:33.590" style="s2">can be studied by reason and by science</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.700" end="00:49:37.310" style="s2">this is the world above the natural</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.590" end="00:49:40.580" style="s2">world what&#39;s the word for above super so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.310" end="00:49:43.190" style="s2">this is the supernatural world and this</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.580" end="00:49:49.010" style="s2">is not a world that can be studied by</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.190" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">science or reason this is a world that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.010" end="00:50:00.650" style="s2">is only right accessible by faith so</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:06.020" style="s2">there&#39;s now the two worlds have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.650" end="00:50:08.570" style="s2">made sort of fundamentally two separate</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.020" end="00:50:10.370" style="s2">kinds of worlds and there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.570" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">continuum between them now there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.370" end="00:50:16.010" style="s2">way of moving through them by love and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:17.750" style="s2">reason United together what now happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.010" end="00:50:19.370" style="s2">is the following and what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.750" end="00:50:23.110" style="s2">happen is the notion of faith is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.370" end="00:50:29.090" style="s2">to be changed to reason is down here and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.110" end="00:50:31.220" style="s2">love is up here and the idea for UGG for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.090" end="00:50:37.010" style="s2">Aquinas I should say is that love moves</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.220" end="00:50:44.060" style="s2">the will see in plutinos and even in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.010" end="00:50:47.630" style="s2">Augustine love moves reason but for</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.060" end="00:50:51.560" style="s2">Aquinas love moves the will love moves</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.630" end="00:50:55.940" style="s2">the will to assert things that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.560" end="00:50:59.030" style="s2">know through reason so love now become</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.940" end="00:51:02.870" style="s2">sort of faith now becomes the act of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.030" end="00:51:05.270" style="s2">willful assertion now to be fair to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.870" end="00:51:08.390" style="s2">Aquinas this is not willful in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.270" end="00:51:13.849" style="s2">of my will this is a will that is being</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.390" end="00:51:17.779" style="s2">by the love of God but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.849" end="00:51:21.529" style="s2">what&#39;s now happening is love and reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.779" end="00:51:24.890" style="s2">are being pulled apart faith is going</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.529" end="00:51:27.559" style="s2">from this participation in the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.890" end="00:51:30.019" style="s2">the course of history to the assertion</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.559" end="00:51:34.130" style="s2">of propositions the assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.019" end="00:51:38.210" style="s2">statements giving a Creed and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.130" end="00:51:40.910" style="s2">fundamentally right science and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.210" end="00:51:44.420" style="s2">spirituality are now being divorced from</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.910" end="00:51:47.089" style="s2">each other in a profound way such that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.420" end="00:51:49.460" style="s2">if it&#39;s scientific it&#39;s not spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.089" end="00:51:52.099" style="s2">and if it&#39;s spiritual it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.460" end="00:51:54.289" style="s2">scientific and if you&#39;re talking and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.099" end="00:51:56.329" style="s2">can see the beginnings of Romanticism if</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.289" end="00:51:58.220" style="s2">it has to do with love then it has</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.329" end="00:51:59.990" style="s2">nothing to do with reason and if it has</p>

<p begin="00:52:11.690" end="00:52:20.890" style="s2">a wonderful writer he is trying to save</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.930" end="00:52:23.509" style="s2">right the axial worldview by</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.700" end="00:52:46.119" style="s2">Aquinas foresees as this becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.630" end="00:52:46.119" style="s2">and more successful and we less and less</p>
