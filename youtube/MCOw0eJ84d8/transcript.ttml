<p begin="00:00:04.270" end="00:00:11.189" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to read something that Nietzsche wrote in the first part Beyond good and evil. Which is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.460" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">section called prejudices of Philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.670" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">and it&#39;s a really good example of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.820" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">the density of this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.300" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">one of the ways of conceptualizing Beyond good and evil, and I think this is true for most great works of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.750" end="00:00:30.899" style="s2">It&#39;s true. Most great works is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">author of the work</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.220" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">Collects; unconsciously collects</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.170" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">from his or her interaction with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.610" end="00:00:51.209" style="s2">then gives them initial formulation</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.780" end="00:00:56.219" style="s2">and the patterns can be deep and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.930" end="00:01:00.670" style="s2">multi-level and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.670" end="00:01:02.440" style="s2">the initial formulation</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.440" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">translates them into not so much ideas as into the seeds of future ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.250" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">the more poetically</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.619" end="00:01:15.419" style="s2">Author happens to be the more the case that his or her</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">ratings contained within the seeds of Future ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.070" end="00:01:28.860" style="s2">Were the romantic philosophers or authors, and I think Nietzsche and dostoevsky are in some sense foremost among them are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.950" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">notable for their ability to do exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.850" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">now in this particular paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.759" end="00:01:39.989" style="s2">This particular paragraph, not only serves as an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.810" end="00:01:43.199" style="s2">But it also serves as a self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.960" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">Reflection on that because Nietzsche is writing a paragraph here that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.700" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">full of the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.710" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">ideas that will actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">bloom and flower to a great degree in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.320" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">But while  he&#39;s simultaneously revealing these those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:06.520" style="s2">He&#39;s also telling you exactly how he&#39;s doing it, and how it is that philosophers do it so it&#39;s a spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.480" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">accomplishment</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">I&#39;m going to read it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">Probably phrase by phrase and then take it apart because it&#39;s so dense and Beyond good evil is like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:21.589" style="s2">When Nietzsche was writing beyond good and evil. He wasn&#39;t very well and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.920" end="00:02:27.950" style="s2">Because of that he had to spend a lot of time thinking and not very much time writing and because he was also</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:30.170" style="s2">Brilliant Beyond comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.600" end="00:02:32.600" style="s2">his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">Distill what he was thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">Incredibly rich</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.880" end="00:02:42.340" style="s2">Phrases and I think in some sense. It&#39;s Beyond parallel. <br />I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.860" style="s2">Often if I&#39;m reading a book if it has any utility at I&#39;ll mark it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:52.660" style="s2">Usually I fold over the top of the page or sometimes put a yellow sticky note on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.660" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">If I find a place where there&#39;s an idea that&#39;s worth returning to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.300" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">That&#39;s particularly worth understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:07.550" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that with a book like Beyond good and evil because what ends up happening is you have to mark every sentence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.890" end="00:03:12.110" style="s2">Obviously marking every sentence isn&#39;t any better than not marking any sentences at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.500" end="00:03:28.580" style="s2">I guess I also might as well tell you why it is worth bothering with a book like this at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">Because it&#39;s a very difficult book, and it&#39;s also the sort of book that will rattle you up.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:41.860" style="s2">So Nietzsche is very interested in the problem of value and the problem of value fundamentally is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">not the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:49.699" style="s2">What is the world made of or even how does the world function which are more</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.549" end="00:03:53.629" style="s2">in some sense more specifically scientific questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.629" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">but how is it that you should conduct yourself in the world how should you act and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.320" end="00:04:06.700" style="s2">People act towards aims in a sense because we&#39;re active creatures, and we&#39;re moving from one point to another</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:14.200" style="s2">we&#39;re moving towards things that we want and that means that we&#39;re guided by our desires and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.700" end="00:04:17.540" style="s2">We&#39;re not only guided by Desires insofar as we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.269" end="00:04:20.599" style="s2">individual desires, we&#39;re guided by</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.389" end="00:04:23.509" style="s2">the structure that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:27.559" style="s2">Consists of how those desires are related to one another</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">So for example if you have a room full of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">Say a room full of children</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.450" end="00:04:39.589" style="s2">They&#39;re active and they&#39;re each pursuing their individual desires</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.590" end="00:04:43.459" style="s2">But at some point they may choose to organize themselves into a game</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:50.780" style="s2">And if they organize themselves into a game what they&#39;re doing for all intents and purposes is producing a little Society</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.080" end="00:04:55.260" style="s2">Little Micro Society within that micro Society they&#39;re deciding</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:05:02.929" style="s2">What desires will be currently expressed and how they&#39;ll exist in relationship to one another and that means that they can cooperate?</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">without too much conflict and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">They can</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:11.389" style="s2">jointly Move Towards a joint Aim</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.419" end="00:05:13.889" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.889" end="00:05:15.889" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.050" end="00:05:17.220" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:22.849" style="s2">Gather all the benefits that might be associated with that and that might be the accomplishment of the aim, whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.849" end="00:05:28.059" style="s2">But it also might be just the enjoyment that&#39;s to be had in the pursuit of that activity now</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.669" end="00:05:30.669" style="s2">People do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">socially because we have to do that in order to get along with other people because our desires have to be melded with those of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:43.329" style="s2">Other people but we also do it psychologically and those two things</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:48.039" style="s2">Exist in a dance because as I&#39;m interacting with other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.300" end="00:05:53.650" style="s2">the demands of the fact that we&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.259" end="00:06:00.399" style="s2">May require each of us to arrange our desires in a way that&#39;s acceptable to everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.310" end="00:06:07.899" style="s2">But at the same time while we&#39;re doing that we&#39;re also observing the process by which those desires are ordered</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.900" end="00:06:13.239" style="s2">And then we internalize that process and use that to order our own desires and then so there&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.380" end="00:06:22.659" style="s2">mutually informative dance between the individual and the group and the culmination of that is the organization of society and the simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.270" end="00:06:25.270" style="s2">organization of the Psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:33.038" style="s2">It&#39;s that process that Nietzsche is talking about in these paragraphs. Now, you might ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.130" end="00:06:36.609" style="s2">Well, what&#39;s the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.580" end="00:06:40.930" style="s2">articulating such things and conceptualizing them and understanding them? and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.960" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">The answer in some ways is straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:51.820" style="s2">If you don&#39;t want to run afoul of your own desires you have to organize them</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.240" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">Because some of them are short-term and some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.900" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">medium-term and some of them are long-term and some of them aim at this and some of them aim at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.849" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">And it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that those desires</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:07.809" style="s2">allow for mutual fulfillment, so for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.880" end="00:07:11.589" style="s2">Maybe you&#39;re very interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.930" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">But you&#39;re also very interested in having a family and some stability in your life</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:21.639" style="s2">Or maybe you&#39;re interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with a whole sequence of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.639" end="00:07:28.059" style="s2">But you&#39;re also interested in having a family and stabilizing your life. It&#39;s not obvious that those desires can</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.789" end="00:07:35.289" style="s2">exist in the same universe without producing what you might think about as war and some of that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.630" end="00:07:39.969" style="s2">Psychological war some of its also going to be a war that actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.490" end="00:07:44.919" style="s2">occurs in existence while you&#39;re fighting through the contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.289" end="00:07:49.749" style="s2">Consequences of wanting to pursue many people and formulate a stable relationship with one person</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.479" end="00:07:58.538" style="s2">now part of the reason that you want to think about these sorts of things is because if you think about them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.729" end="00:08:00.729" style="s2">get your thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.009" end="00:08:03.009" style="s2">your value system</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.370" end="00:08:06.349" style="s2">intelligently and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.349" end="00:08:09.660" style="s2">Coherently and cogently laid out then</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:13.100" style="s2">when you act out that value system in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.400" end="00:08:18.480" style="s2">You&#39;re going to run into less conflict and less uncertainty and less misery and you&#39;re going to have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:21.600" style="s2">Probability of getting what it is that you want.</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.220" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">But you&#39;re also going to have a higher probability</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:29.180" style="s2">Of getting what you want in a way that allows you to cooperate with other people without</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.380" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">entering into too much conflict with them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.620" end="00:08:40.630" style="s2">So in some sense the purpose that you think the reason that you think are the purpose of thinking is so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">sort out</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.479" style="s2">How you&#39;re going to move forward in the world without having to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.390" end="00:08:48.649" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.649" end="00:08:53.078" style="s2">Run headlong into all the obstacles that you might run into if you were doing such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.209" end="00:08:56.589" style="s2">Blindly and so then you might ask yourself. Well why would you bother reading?</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.949" end="00:09:03.369" style="s2">Philosophy or the Philosophy Written by someone who&#39;s great and the answer to that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.949" end="00:09:10.899" style="s2">They can help you think these things through in a manner that you would not be capable of doing on your own</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.180" end="00:09:13.180" style="s2">you know because</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.310" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">Nietzsche minutes it&#39;s difficult to estimate how intelligent Nietzsche was but I suspect he was perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.269" end="00:09:22.040" style="s2">one in a billion</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.040" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">which would put him far Beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:27.480" style="s2">99.999% and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a massive difference between the ability of people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:38.049" style="s2">think as you move farther and farther out into the extremes of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:41.259" style="s2">when you have the writings of someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:49.329" style="s2">one in a billion, then you can interact with those writings in the way that enables you if you&#39;ll put the time into</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.319" end="00:09:54.729" style="s2">benefit from the spectacular fact of that intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">Nietzsche was a full professor by the time he was 24 at a time and now he didn&#39;t even have to write his dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">They just made him a full professor at a time where that never happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.140" end="00:10:16.420" style="s2">so this is what he has to say in the prejudices of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.580" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">Philosophers such as the first chapter of the book Beyond good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">“It has gradually become clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.700" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:37.340" style="s2">the species of Involuntary and unconscious autobiography”</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:40.380" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.380" end="00:10:42.380" style="s2">That&#39;s a deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.780" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">That&#39;s a deceptively simple sentence even though. It&#39;s not a particularly simple sentence because it it stands on its head. What people generally</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">assume about the process of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:11:01.380" style="s2">You generally think that when you&#39;re thinking you&#39;re thinking about, as I mentioned before, the structure of the objective world but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.100" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">Nietzsche is making an entirely different point here</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:12.739" style="s2">and what he&#39;s fundamentally doing is treating the philosopher not as a rational being but as a living being and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.500" end="00:11:17.570" style="s2">There&#39;s a big difference between being a rational being and being a living being</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.820" end="00:11:21.109" style="s2">Because if you&#39;re a living being your primary goal is to do whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.110" end="00:11:25.520" style="s2">Is that furthers your life. And if you&#39;re a rational being then your primary goal is to do whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.520" end="00:11:32.150" style="s2">is that a rational being might do and you could say that a living being should first and foremost be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:39.140" style="s2">Rational being and in some sense that&#39;s the message of the of the western enlightenment, but it&#39;s by no means</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.990" end="00:11:41.240" style="s2">Self-evident that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.240" end="00:11:45.710" style="s2">And it&#39;s certainly not something that Nietzsche doesn&#39;t believe that people are rational beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.140" end="00:11:53.749" style="s2">As certainly not primarily and more importantly he isn&#39;t exactly convinced that they should be. So, for example, one of Nietzsche&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.820" end="00:11:55.820" style="s2">Famous Maxim&#39;s is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.370" end="00:11:58.370" style="s2">truth serves life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.860" end="00:12:05.540" style="s2">That&#39;s a very difficult different idea then the purpose of truth says the accurate representation of the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.060" end="00:12:09.109" style="s2">Those aren&#39;t the same thing at all now you could ask well</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.110" end="00:12:13.190" style="s2">What does it mean for truth to serve life and if you construe truth that way?</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.190" end="00:12:20.749" style="s2">What would truth look like and you know the mere statement: &quot;the truth should serve life&quot; doesn&#39;t offer you the answers to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.480" end="00:12:23.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.470" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">But it&#39;s the beginning of a different metaphysics and in some sense of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">which is say the universe within which a philosopher might operate a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.879" end="00:12:36.860" style="s2">metaphysics is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.860" end="00:12:38.860" style="s2">initial structure of presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.949" end="00:12:43.808" style="s2">Within which a view of the world is organized</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.980" end="00:12:50.769" style="s2">One presupposition might be human beings are rational and that we&#39;re attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">formulate and improve our</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:13:01.899" style="s2">Sense of the objective world our formulation of the objective world and another would be that human beings aren&#39;t rational were irrational and that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.360" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">Motivated to do is to live whatever that means and that the purpose of our thinking and our philosophy should be to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.870" end="00:13:12.669" style="s2">our living and that&#39;s Nietzsche&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.699" end="00:13:15.699" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.980" end="00:13:17.980" style="s2">blocks of Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.189" end="00:13:26.469" style="s2">So he&#39;s a moral philosopher fundamentally because morality is about values and values essentially values are</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">You could say values are what you aim for but it&#39;s more complicated than that values</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.449" end="00:13:37.599" style="s2">Actually constitute the lens through which you view the world so it&#39;s partly what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">but it&#39;s also partly your conception of who you are now and where you are and it&#39;s also partly your</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.829" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">conception of how you&#39;re going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.589" end="00:13:47.739" style="s2">Where it is that you want to be and it&#39;s also?</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.379" end="00:13:50.379" style="s2">partly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.649" end="00:13:54.999" style="s2">Psychological system that you use to parse up the world so that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.069" end="00:13:58.569" style="s2">Reveals to you the pathway that you can take to get to what you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.089" end="00:14:03.609" style="s2">Values all of that, and then it&#39;s more than that because you could say that you have our value</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.850" end="00:14:06.189" style="s2">Which contains all of that?</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.189" end="00:14:10.119" style="s2">But then you can say that you have a set of values which is the arrangement of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.120" end="00:14:12.120" style="s2">And then you could say that you have a set of values</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.139" end="00:14:16.508" style="s2">that&#39;s the arrangement of all that that you have to arrange with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">Then you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:23.589" style="s2">You have all that and you have to arrange it with other people and you have to arrange it across different spans of time</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.870" end="00:14:26.349" style="s2">Because what you want today, and what you want next week</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.350" end="00:14:31.749" style="s2">And what you want next month are not necessarily the same thing and one does not necessarily lead into the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.209" end="00:14:36.039" style="s2">so to be a moral philosopher is to examine how that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.980" end="00:14:42.009" style="s2">What that system is and how it operates and how it came about now one of the things that Nietzsche says is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.259" end="00:14:44.199" style="s2">It has gradually become clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.199" end="00:14:51.789" style="s2">Whatever Greek philosophy up till now is consisted of namely the confession of its originator and a species of involuntary and unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.129" end="00:14:56.798" style="s2">Autobiography so his claim fundamentally is that no matter what the philosopher thinks,</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.809" end="00:15:01.089" style="s2">He&#39;s doing while he&#39;s reading philosophy what he&#39;s actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.179" end="00:15:03.980" style="s2">revealing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.980" end="00:15:05.980" style="s2">articulating his being and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.829" end="00:15:08.049" style="s2">Then you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.049" end="00:15:12.609" style="s2">where did that being come from and the answer to that is well partly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.009" end="00:15:16.719" style="s2">You could consider it a biological function insofar as that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.089" end="00:15:23.048" style="s2">Value structures that are built into us that are the process we would say the process of a very long evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.209" end="00:15:26.798" style="s2">but because you&#39;re also a cultural phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.259" end="00:15:34.688" style="s2">because the manner in which you&#39;ve arranged your values and your desires has been conditioned to the last degree by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.260" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">process of enculturation that you are subjected to when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.860" end="00:15:49.060" style="s2">Confess in an autobiographical manner and articulate that what you&#39;re also doing is recapitulating</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.220" end="00:15:53.350" style="s2">The entire structure of your culture it&#39;s in you and you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.350" end="00:15:57.250" style="s2">Where is it in you? And what is in you mean? part of it means is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.649" end="00:16:00.039" style="s2">you act out a pattern of behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.559" end="00:16:04.269" style="s2">That pattern of behavior is like a a dance that someone is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.790" end="00:16:08.949" style="s2">Manifesting to a symphonic score. It&#39;s unbelievably complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.589" end="00:16:10.879" style="s2">It has its</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.879" end="00:16:16.359" style="s2">Psychological elements and some of those are conscious and some of them aren&#39;t some of them are just implicit and embedded in the way you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.360" end="00:16:22.299" style="s2">Act and the way you perceive, and what the philosopher is attempting to do is to reveal those to himself and to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.269" end="00:16:29.318" style="s2">Articulate them so that the entire structure can be analysed well, so Nietzsche&#39;s first proposition. Is that when</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.589" end="00:16:34.058" style="s2">Philosopher is thinking that what he&#39;s doing is not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.059" end="00:16:41.709" style="s2">it&#39;s revealing himself in an autobiographical sense under the guise of rational thinking and so then it becomes something more like a story and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.389" end="00:16:46.389" style="s2">Well, and he covers all that in the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.290" end="00:16:48.910" style="s2">two phrases</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">so that gives you some example some indication of what this book is like.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.570" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">A species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.110" end="00:17:05.249" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a more complicated idea too because you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:10.530" style="s2">Why would someone be driven in a nun book in Voluntary way in an unconscious way to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.770" end="00:17:13.770" style="s2">describe their autobiography? and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a very complicated question it might be that one of the reasons that people value one another is because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.890" end="00:17:28.440" style="s2">engage in the process of sharing Deeply autobiographical information</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.020" end="00:17:32.759" style="s2">You tell me your story, and I tell you my story, and you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.760" end="00:17:35.910" style="s2">why do we even bother with such things and the answer to that is well if</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.130" end="00:17:41.489" style="s2">You can tell me about the pain and tragedy that you&#39;ve encountered then that gives me a better</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.050" style="s2">Way.. that gives me a better vision of the dangers of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.660" end="00:17:51.749" style="s2">Without actually having to expose myself to those dangers except in simulation. I might feel sorry for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:55.950" style="s2">I might feel bad about your tragic experiences, but I&#39;m not bleeding for them</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.950" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">And then there&#39;s always the possibility that you&#39;ll also tell me</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.980" end="00:18:00.550" style="s2">How you solved your problem.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.550" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">In which case I can either avoid that problem entirely or if I do encounter</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.350" end="00:18:06.330" style="s2">I can solve it without having to go through.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.330" end="00:18:11.639" style="s2">Maybe it took you decades to formulate your solution to that problem, and you can tell me your story</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.640" end="00:18:16.050" style="s2">And then I have the information, and so that&#39;s part of what human beings are always trading</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.050" end="00:18:21.419" style="s2">That&#39;s why we talk to each other. That&#39;s why we can communicate and so Nietzsche would say well, it&#39;s it&#39;s involuntary</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.030" end="00:18:23.290" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.290" end="00:18:31.050" style="s2">Involuntary and unconscious. He&#39;s alluding to the fact that that proclivity is so deeply embedded in people that the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.750" end="00:18:34.349" style="s2">to make an autobiographical recounting that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.300" end="00:18:43.590" style="s2">It serves as the kind of motivation that we don&#39;t question for doing almost everything that we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.380" end="00:18:46.210" style="s2">So you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.210" end="00:18:50.909" style="s2">People do such things as attend movies and plays and they usually do that happily</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.220" end="00:18:56.610" style="s2">Especially if the movie or the play is of high quality and the same thing happens with we&#39;re reading novels</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.840" end="00:18:59.950" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.950" end="00:19:05.129" style="s2">Attracted to such things they have a built-in value, and it&#39;s very rarely the case that people will ever question</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.130" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">why it is that they&#39;re doing such things in fact you see this quite commonly with students who are first introduced to the study of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:12.430" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.430" end="00:19:15.629" style="s2">the the introduction of the idea that you should</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.530" end="00:19:22.050" style="s2">Analyze what it is that you&#39;re engaged in when you&#39;re reading actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:26.009" style="s2">comes as unwelcome news to most people who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:33.389" style="s2">Inclined towards fiction because they don&#39;t want to interfere with the process of engagement you know automatic unconscious engagement with the material</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.780" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">By detaching themselves and having to think about what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.280" end="00:19:41.500" style="s2">So that&#39;s why it&#39;s an involuntary and unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.040" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things within which thought operates rather than one of the things on which thought operates.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">Then he says “The moral or immoral purpose in which every philosophy has constituted...”</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:03.380" style="s2">Sorry; “The moral or immoral purpose IN every Philosophy has constituted the true</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:07.740" style="s2">Vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown”</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:14.160" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a hell of a thing to say too because what Nietzsche is alluding to there in some sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.229" end="00:20:27.219" style="s2">The Philosopher can&#39;t help and that would be in some sense also the person who is recounting their autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.640" end="00:20:29.960" style="s2">Can&#39;t help but tell you what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:36.860" style="s2">even though they might not know and this is something that Jung because Jung was, Carl Jung, the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2">psychoanalyst was a great student of Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.060" end="00:20:43.060" style="s2">Jung came to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">Believe that we all inhabited stories that the stories were the stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:52.689" style="s2">We inhabited were actually the structures of value within which we live and that those stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:20:55.509" style="s2">essentially had an ethic or a moral and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.999" end="00:20:59.469" style="s2">Then you you can start thinking about what the ethics and the morals</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.539" end="00:21:04.478" style="s2">Might be and you kind of have some sense of that because there&#39;s there&#39;s comedic stories and tragic stories</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.479" end="00:21:08.529" style="s2">And there&#39;s evil characters and good characters and so forth those are our particular characters</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:14.649" style="s2">But part of the point that Nietzsche is attempting to make here is that the philosopher is in fact aiming at something with his life</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.619" end="00:21:22.478" style="s2">With all of his actions he might not even know what it is, but partly what he&#39;s doing in his attempt to philosophize is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.059" end="00:21:26.319" style="s2">articulate that and reveal it to himself and to other people, so</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.440" end="00:21:35.289" style="s2">then the question becomes well, what is it that the person is up to and I would say in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.289" end="00:21:41.049" style="s2">that&#39;s the ultimate question and so Nietzsche here in this paragraph it is also dealing with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.749" end="00:21:48.603" style="s2">Ultimate question in life which might be well what is your life aimed, and you might say well, it&#39;s not aimed at anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.603" end="00:21:52.059" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t seem to have any coherent set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.059" end="00:21:56.348" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what I believe I don&#39;t believe in anything even but that&#39;s not the case because</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.599" end="00:21:59.139" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t believe in anything, you couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.289" end="00:22:05.258" style="s2">you have to believe in something to be able to see because you point your eyes at things and you can&#39;t organize your</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.359" end="00:22:12.459" style="s2">Vision without having an aim and so the very act of interacting with the world presupposes an ethic and then all those</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.099" end="00:22:18.969" style="s2">Micro ethics that you contain within you are organized into some sort of structure either</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:21.369" style="s2">Badly or well, and that structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.889" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">Roughly has an aim</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:28.090" style="s2">And you might know it and you might not but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there so so what other thing that Nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.090" end="00:22:30.090" style="s2">Alluding to is that you believe things</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.680" end="00:22:32.760" style="s2">Whether or not you think you believe them.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.540" end="00:22:40.100" style="s2">In fact believing them and knowing you believe them aren&#39;t even the same thing and so that people believe all sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.340" end="00:22:43.640" style="s2">They don&#39;t know about and then partly what they&#39;re doing when they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.700" end="00:22:48.600" style="s2">Philosophy is to try to figure out what those things are you know and you can also ask yourself where did they come from?</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">Well they partly came from you, but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.060" end="00:22:54.060" style="s2">You&#39;re an old thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.170" end="00:22:59.379" style="s2">Your physical form is three and a half billion years old, and you&#39;re the process of all that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.990" end="00:23:02.560" style="s2">all the death and struggling that went</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.290" end="00:23:10.359" style="s2">Along the entire course of that three and a half billion years is you carry that with you and then on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:13.900" style="s2">Inside you is the consequence of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.219" style="s2">Cultural history of Complex life, that&#39;s all inside you, too</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.220" end="00:23:22.540" style="s2">and then on top of that some of that&#39;s articulated more or less some fits act without</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.270" end="00:23:27.459" style="s2">Dramatized represented in fiction and that sort of thing and then some of its articulated</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:34.900" style="s2">but there&#39;s way more at the bottom than is fully articulated and so God only knows what you&#39;re up to and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.180" end="00:23:38.469" style="s2">Then you might say well who cares? well the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.470" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">Is that you care because first of all that&#39;s the definition of caring and second of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.250" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">that Determines the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.530" end="00:23:47.800" style="s2">way that you&#39;ll move through your life and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:50.050" style="s2">Everything that happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.050" end="00:23:55.719" style="s2">That&#39;s good or evil or good or bad is going to be a consequence of the manifestation of that ethic in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.450" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">So now Nietzsche is saying something else too when he says:</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.230" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">“The moral or immoral purpose in every Philosophy has</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.220" end="00:24:13.959" style="s2">Constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant is always grown”</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.470" end="00:24:22.150" style="s2">He&#39;s saying that the philosopher can&#39;t help but reveal his aim in his writings, and then he&#39;s saying something else</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.150" end="00:24:24.459" style="s2">which is that aim might be malevolent and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.850" end="00:24:29.589" style="s2">You know modern people aren&#39;t very comfortable with ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:34.030" style="s2">malevolence because malevolence is an idea that&#39;s related to evil and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.720" end="00:24:39.280" style="s2">Modern people think of themselves as beyond good and evil to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.350" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t believe in the reality of those concepts and of course in this book Nietzsche&#39;s also questioning our</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.170" end="00:24:53.509" style="s2">At least our a priori presuppositions about what good and evil are but that doesn&#39;t mean that he doesn&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.150" end="00:24:59.720" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t mean that. He doesn&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t exist yes. I guess that&#39;s I guess that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.180" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">You know this is one of the things I&#39;ve thought about when I was thinking about when I thought about how Hitler died</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.580" end="00:25:10.580" style="s2">No, Hitler died...</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.640" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">Hitler Committed suicide in a bunker underneath Berlin when Europe was in flames and so one</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.580" end="00:25:27.619" style="s2">Conclusion that a psycho analytically minded historian could derive from that is that&#39;s what he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.190" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">Right and then that opens up an entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">Vast nest of snakes because one of the things that you might ask is well</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.160" end="00:25:43.999" style="s2">how is it that someone would desire that? First of all could that even be desired? Is that actually something that anyone could even desire?</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.420" end="00:25:49.580" style="s2">Then you might ask well. Why is it that someone would desire that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.190" end="00:25:56.809" style="s2">Then the next thing you might ask is if a human being could desire that and hit there was a human being then exactly what?</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.810" end="00:25:59.509" style="s2">Does that say about you and you might say well?</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.510" end="00:26:04.729" style="s2">I could never desire such a thing but following along the train of the argument that we&#39;ve been laying out is like</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.730" end="00:26:07.880" style="s2">What makes you think you&#39;re a reliable judge of what it is that you&#39;re up to?</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:13.160" style="s2">So okay, so now we&#39;ve unpacked three sentences and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:17.270" style="s2">We&#39;ll continue on with the same paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:21.000" style="s2">“Indeed to understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.000" end="00:26:27.180" style="s2">How the most abstract metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.480" end="00:26:34.700" style="s2">It is always well and wise to first ask oneself: What morality do they or does he aim at?”</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.480" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">So what the question is what&#39;s the personality?</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.290" end="00:26:42.290" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:48.269" style="s2">There&#39;s an entire nest of snakes underneath that sentence that&#39;s sequence of propositions as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.860" end="00:27:07.620" style="s2">And one of them is well. What does it mean [that] people are up to something? What does it mean that they&#39;re aiming at something?</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:17.380" style="s2">“Accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.640" end="00:27:22.600" style="s2">but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.400" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">Mistaken knowledge as an instrument</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.820" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted is inspiring them”</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.500" end="00:27:38.600" style="s2">This is partly where this is going to require editing; it&#39;s so complicated to go through.</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:48.300" style="s2">“Accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.160" end="00:27:56.420" style="s2">But that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument”</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.420" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">Alright so let&#39;s take that apart; “accordingly I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy”</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.500" end="00:28:07.660" style="s2">So one of the claims I suppose this would be an enlightenment claim is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.309" end="00:28:09.330" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.330" end="00:28:16.819" style="s2">People do have a drive to knowledge, and the that drive is in fact. What underlies the production of such things as philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:24.379" style="s2">but Nietzsche questions that because he&#39;s trying to bring us back to consideration of the fact that you can&#39;t separate the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.809" end="00:28:28.309" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s mind from the Philosopher&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.830" end="00:28:35.720" style="s2">His first and foremost a living creature, and he&#39;s up to something and the question is what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.720" end="00:28:40.699" style="s2">he&#39;s up to? And so you can see the earliest manifestations in</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.040" end="00:28:43.790" style="s2">a paragraph like this of what later developed into</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">deconstructionist thought and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.110" end="00:28:53.329" style="s2">that that was mostly French continental philosophers who pursued that particular line of reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.990" end="00:29:00.050" style="s2">It is derived exactly from this kind of statement by Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.809" end="00:29:03.349" style="s2">so for example someone like Derrida would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.040" end="00:29:07.609" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t matter what the content of the text is</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.220" end="00:29:11.689" style="s2">what matters is that the text can be used as a tool for power and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.120" end="00:29:14.510" style="s2">Then whether the person who wrote the text knew it or not?</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.510" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what they were doing and they were doing it in a way to privilege themselves above other people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.180" end="00:29:25.000" style="s2">That&#39;s really I would say the fundamental deconstructionist claim, and it&#39;s a powerful claim</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.000" end="00:29:31.800" style="s2">It&#39;s an utterly corrupt claim, but it&#39;s a really powerful claim, and it&#39;s related directly to the sorts of things that Nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.540" end="00:29:39.189" style="s2">Referring to in this paragraph. What is it that the person&#39;s truly up to? Now the problem with the de-constructionist claim</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.190" end="00:29:46.299" style="s2">Is that it&#39;s an it&#39;s an open invitation to cynicism, to thoughtless cynicism. I can just make the presupposition that whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.300" end="00:29:48.230" style="s2">Is that you&#39;re telling me</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.230" end="00:29:51.250" style="s2">You&#39;re telling me merely to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:54.189" style="s2">Regardless of what it is that you claim to be doing.</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.860" end="00:29:58.420" style="s2">well the problem with that approach is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:04.210" style="s2">It&#39;s predicated on the implicit assumption that the only</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.670" end="00:30:10.389" style="s2">Value that people actually have is the value to is the desire to dominate and of course that&#39;s a purely</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.670" end="00:30:13.449" style="s2">But that could be the case and I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.640" end="00:30:18.009" style="s2">It&#39;s even reasonable to posit that to some degree that it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.110" end="00:30:22.750" style="s2">But to take that from a contributing factor and to make that the highest God</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.180" end="00:30:27.790" style="s2">because that&#39;s essentially what the de-constructionists are doing those are entirely different things and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.550" end="00:30:30.550" style="s2">You have to beware of people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.300" end="00:30:36.610" style="s2">take a single causal element and elevate it to the stature of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.120" end="00:30:40.959" style="s2">single comprehensive cause. You know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.510" end="00:30:47.589" style="s2">it&#39;s more reasonable to assume that people are complex in their motivations and that many different strands of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.230" end="00:30:51.939" style="s2">Biological and cultural motivation are in some sense primary</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:55.030" style="s2">and then what happens is that they come together to weave a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.250" end="00:31:00.520" style="s2">Tapestry rather than to make the automatic assumption that you can reduce the entire set of human</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.740" end="00:31:03.729" style="s2">Motivations to a single principle like that of power now</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.730" end="00:31:11.020" style="s2">You know I would say Nietzsche is also responsible to some degree for the deconstructionist claim that its power because one of his most famous</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.720" end="00:31:17.199" style="s2">Utterances was that the fundamental motivating force in life is the will to power</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.290" end="00:31:24.219" style="s2">But he wasn&#39;t so much, because Nietzsche is a subtle thinker, he wasn&#39;t so much attempting to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.130" end="00:31:31.809" style="s2">Human motivation to power he was attempting to redefine what it was that we conceptualized as power</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.630" end="00:31:38.859" style="s2">Whereas that as the de-constructionists certainly you know all because fundamentally they&#39;re marxists and they believe that you know they</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:42.610" style="s2">ensconced themselves within an economic Viewpoint where</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.670" end="00:31:49.930" style="s2">Within a philosophical Viewpoint where economics is paramount and where all that matters is power</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.810" end="00:31:52.870" style="s2">construed as socio economic</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:31:55.870" style="s2">domination fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.060" end="00:32:00.610" style="s2">You know and that&#39;s in turn is embedded in metaphysics. That&#39;s even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.610" end="00:32:04.299" style="s2">which is the metaphysics that presumes that people are fundamentally materialist and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.850" end="00:32:08.140" style="s2">All of those things are quite and all of those things are highly questionable</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.620" end="00:32:27.529" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to skip ahead a little bit of the paragraph when Nietzsche talks about</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.890" end="00:32:32.629" style="s2">The motivations of you might consider them</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.500" end="00:32:36.649" style="s2">people who are working in the Middle ranks of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.280" end="00:32:43.180" style="s2">Bureaucracies, whether they&#39;re scientific, or otherwise, so they&#39;re in some sense acting as cogs in a particular machine</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.180" end="00:32:45.660" style="s2">And so that&#39;s what he&#39;s describing here he says</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.520" end="00:32:54.760" style="s2">“In the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men,</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.620" end="00:32:57.480" style="s2">it may be [...]</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.480" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">there may really be such a thing as an ‘impulse to knowledge,’ some kind of small, independent clock-work, which,</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.500" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">when well wound up, works away industriously to that end,</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.550" end="00:33:10.550" style="s2">without the rest of the scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.800" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2">impulses taking any material part therein.</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.800" end="00:33:18.560" style="s2">The actual &#39;interests&#39; of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction -</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.260" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s point there, fundamentally, is that even when you do analyse people in whom</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.070" end="00:33:55.900" style="s2">The will to knowledge might actually be offered</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.360" end="00:34:01.059" style="s2">Even though he wouldn&#39;t be willing to granted the status of highest motivating power</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.429" end="00:34:07.119" style="s2">That even in those people where that will to knowledge does exist the probability that that is in turn</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.639" end="00:34:09.349" style="s2">Subordinated to some other</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.349" end="00:34:13.029" style="s2">principle that&#39;s higher in the value Hierarchy is very very high and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.369" end="00:34:18.729" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to tell exactly what that additional principle might be but he points out such things as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.730" end="00:34:22.119" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re primarily interested in serving the interests of their family or</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.369" end="00:34:26.949" style="s2">They&#39;re primarily interested in making money or maybe they&#39;re primarily interested in status</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.950" end="00:34:32.409" style="s2">And maybe they&#39;re interested in status status becomes it because it makes them more sexually attractive and that sort of thing, so</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.990" end="00:34:34.990" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:43.749" style="s2">question of what is it that&#39;s lurking in the background is always paramount, so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.010" end="00:34:48.010" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:53.079" style="s2">Detour in this particular paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.600" end="00:35:01.580" style="s2">“whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.420" end="00:35:10.900" style="s2">with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring genii (or as demons),</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.940" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another,</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.520" end="00:35:21.700" style="s2">and that each of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.860" end="00:35:24.520" style="s2">legitimate lord over all of the other impulses”</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.300" end="00:35:31.800" style="s2">That&#39;s another like the beyond good and evil to think of it as a book is a really foolish</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.490" end="00:35:40.030" style="s2">Framework you know because this is what a book is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.210" end="00:35:44.830" style="s2">when people think about a book no, it&#39;s like a material entity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.740" end="00:35:47.570" style="s2">It&#39;s eight inches high</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.570" end="00:35:53.709" style="s2">And six inches wide and two inches thick and weighs a pound and it&#39;s made out of paper. It&#39;s between two</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.260" end="00:35:59.140" style="s2">Covers you know and that&#39;s a materialist. That&#39;s the A priori sort of axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.900" end="00:36:01.900" style="s2">view of the book. But Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.020" end="00:36:06.430" style="s2">Beyond good, and Evil. Isn&#39;t a book at all. It&#39;s a series of bombs and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.310" end="00:36:09.310" style="s2">each sentence is a ball and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.770" end="00:36:16.450" style="s2">Each sentence blows things up that people don&#39;t even know exists and so one of the things with this sentence for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.360" end="00:36:22.269" style="s2">here&#39;s how he&#39;s conceptualize a human being so the first thing he talks about is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:26.469" style="s2">There are fundamental impulses of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.110" end="00:36:33.670" style="s2">Okay, so that begs questions. What do you mean by impulse? And what do you mean by fundamental? and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.910" end="00:36:41.019" style="s2">Both of those are externally complicated problems, so an impulse you can think of an impulse as a drive</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.630" end="00:36:44.109" style="s2">You could think about it as a biological instinct</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:51.519" style="s2">You could think about it as an aim or a goal you could think about it as an act of will like there&#39;s endless</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:57.789" style="s2">questions that hang off that question, but we could start with the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.760" end="00:37:00.040" style="s2">Perhaps can&#39;t Define it.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.040" end="00:37:07.570" style="s2">But we are willing to go with the proposition that people do have impulses and I think maybe that&#39;s manifest to you more particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:11.439" style="s2">when you&#39;re attempting to do something voluntarily and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.100" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">something involuntarily interferes with that you know, so maybe you&#39;re sitting down to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.200" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">To try to get some work done in the work is not of any particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.730" end="00:37:25.449" style="s2">Intrinsic interest but you regard it as necessary</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:32.980" style="s2">You know necessary element in some higher order scheme, and so you&#39;re attempting to organize yourself. So you will in fact concentrate on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.560" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">particular relatively mundane activity</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:40.180" style="s2">But what you find when you sit down to actually engage in that is you can&#39;t do it.</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:45.819" style="s2">You have to go do the dishes or you have to clean under the bed or you have to have a sexual fantasy?</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.980" end="00:37:51.640" style="s2">or you or there&#39;s some other thing that you could do this useful but that you would normally do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.640" end="00:37:57.609" style="s2">You&#39;ll go do instead or that you fall asleep or that you get hungry or like there&#39;s an endless number</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.770" end="00:38:05.770" style="s2">Let&#39;s call them impulses that might arise to interfere with your conscious movement forward well exactly what are those things</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.890" end="00:38:08.890" style="s2">while Nietzsche certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.320" end="00:38:14.259" style="s2">conceptualizes the human being as a place where those things live and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.080" end="00:38:19.299" style="s2">he does mean live to because it wouldn&#39;t refer to them as demons or</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.120" end="00:38:21.650" style="s2">genies</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.650" end="00:38:28.660" style="s2">Without introducing the metaphorical conception of something that lives and so hardly what Nietzsche reveals in those sentences is that he</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.850" end="00:38:31.029" style="s2">conceptualized as a human being as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.240" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">dwelling place of Spirits and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.690" end="00:38:39.850" style="s2">Some of them are genii let&#39;s say, that&#39;s the root word of genius</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.850" end="00:38:43.719" style="s2">That&#39;s the terribly powerful thing that exists in the terribly small</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.919" style="s2">compartment right that you have to call forth and some of them are demons and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.460" end="00:38:53.220" style="s2">Demons are things that have their own autonomous will and the generally aren&#39;t aiming for the good</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:39:00.900" style="s2">So then so those are all things Nietzsche just lays out as implicit parts of the sentence so he activates all those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.360" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">whether you know it or not in your mind to the degree that you process the sentence and those things start to take on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.300" end="00:39:09.300" style="s2">life of Their own those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.070" end="00:39:12.070" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.100" end="00:39:17.110" style="s2">Then he adds another dimension of complexity to that by saying well</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.990" end="00:39:19.990" style="s2">you&#39;re full of demons and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.100" end="00:39:22.100" style="s2">and genies and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.060" end="00:39:27.169" style="s2">They&#39;re all doing their own thing whatever that happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:35.300" style="s2">but each of them if left to their own devices would attempt to remake the entire world in their</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:38.820" style="s2">form and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.820" end="00:39:40.560" style="s2">So I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.560" end="00:39:42.390" style="s2">Thought of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.390" end="00:39:47.089" style="s2">from a narrative point of view or from a symbolic point of view in</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.060" end="00:39:51.160" style="s2">old stories in folk tales and Fairy Tales you often have</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.700" end="00:39:59.420" style="s2">cyclops, they&#39;re one-eyed giants, and there&#39;s a sexual connotation to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.680" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">which is our proposed that the psychoanalysts would would certainly point out</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.930" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">But the one eye idea is that this thing is gigantic who wants one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.150" end="00:40:17.629" style="s2">And so that&#39;s another way that Nietzsche is conceptualizing the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.840" end="00:40:25.880" style="s2">Structure of the human psyche it&#39;s a dwelling place full of one-eyed giants</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.880" end="00:40:29.740" style="s2">And they&#39;re constantly. well one thing one way of looking at is,</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.749" end="00:40:31.160" style="s2">They&#39;re constantly at war</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:33.000" style="s2">One of them wants to be the largest</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.000" end="00:40:35.030" style="s2">one-eyed giant and dominate everything else</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.030" end="00:40:42.140" style="s2">And then one of the things that so Nietzsche takes that argument further he says not only is this always happening in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.300" end="00:40:46.180" style="s2">But that if you look at Philosophy what it is, is it&#39;s a continual</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">revelation of the attempt of some</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.800" end="00:40:52.070" style="s2">singular Minded psychic</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.650" end="00:40:56.030" style="s2">monsters psychological monster to dominate the entire</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.480" end="00:41:03.350" style="s2">Psychological structure therefore the entire cultural structure therefore the entire world and then you can you can see in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.200" end="00:41:09.890" style="s2">The entire religious structure struggle of mankind to take this vast</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.590" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">polytheistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:14.250" style="s2">vision of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.250" end="00:41:16.909" style="s2">reality and to organize it into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">monotheistic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:21.890" style="s2">Integrated structure which you could also consider</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.160" end="00:41:25.160" style="s2">indistinguishable from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.220" end="00:41:30.580" style="s2">civilizing; the impulse that operates in human beings to become civilized</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.100" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:38.419" style="s2">On the one hand it might a terrible thing that one one-eyed monster emerges to attempt to dominate all the others</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.580" end="00:41:45.379" style="s2">but then on the other hand there&#39;s no difference between that and organizing something because to organize something is to bring it all into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.869" end="00:41:53.209" style="s2">Hierarchical structure with some sort of singular value at the Forefront and then the question might be well</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.210" end="00:41:55.879" style="s2">What should that singular value be and then?</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.119" end="00:42:02.059" style="s2">Nietzsche would that ties it the whole argument back into the first sentences that he wrote at the beginning of the paragraph which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:09.679" style="s2">Well, what is it that the philosopher is up to what is the force that he&#39;s serving? What is the unifying impulse?</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:11.030" style="s2">That&#39;s another way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.030" end="00:42:12.260" style="s2">If there&#39;s a unifying impulse</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.260" end="00:42:19.909" style="s2">and he&#39;s not only fallen prey to some internal Demon if there&#39;s a unifying impulse to bring all of this together into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.790" end="00:42:23.479" style="s2">functional structure what exactly might that look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:31.190" style="s2">“For every impulse is imperious, and as such, attempts to philosophise.”</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.350" end="00:42:36.409" style="s2">That&#39;s part of that, sort of Nietzsche&#39;s idea of will to power</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.230" end="00:42:40.820" style="s2">In its nascent form like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.390" end="00:42:44.390" style="s2">unconscious entities that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.670" end="00:42:46.670" style="s2">inhabit that human psyche are all alive</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.670" end="00:42:47.460" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.460" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to live, they&#39;re trying to climb up the dominance hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.280" end="00:42:55.480" style="s2">dominate because of course that&#39;s partly what life does because</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.280" end="00:43:02.749" style="s2">Let&#39;s say from an evolutionary perspective, and this is probably more true for males because there are less</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.920" end="00:43:06.920" style="s2">effective in their attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:09.000" style="s2">replicate</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.000" end="00:43:11.000" style="s2">the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.609" end="00:43:16.099" style="s2">Climbing up a dominance hierarchy whatever that might happen to be and success is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.950" end="00:43:19.700" style="s2">there may be no distinction at all and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.609" end="00:43:24.859" style="s2">then you might say well that just shows that there&#39;s nothing but will to power but</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.080" style="s2">That still doesn&#39;t answer one of the most fundamental questions is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.109" end="00:43:33.229" style="s2">Power in relationship to what?</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.220" end="00:43:36.220" style="s2">Because that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.240" end="00:43:41.240" style="s2">Okay, so you can shut that off.</p>
