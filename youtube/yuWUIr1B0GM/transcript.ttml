<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">Channel 4 News for many years lyonell</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:19.290" style="s2">used to be a regular guest on Channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:22.530" style="s2">News and it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.290" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">was sort of thinking and I we didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.530" end="00:00:24.680" style="s2">to this point</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">lyonell but we were talking before about</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.680" end="00:00:31.980" style="s2">kind of our political leanings and I I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:34.289" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily define myself on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.980" end="00:00:35.519" style="s2">political spectrum at the moment much</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.289" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">because I&#39;m not really sure where I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.519" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">but I sort of feel I&#39;ve always I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:42.449" style="s2">always have defined myself as left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:44.519" style="s2">and certainly over the last five years</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.449" end="00:00:48.839" style="s2">or so would probably describe myself as</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.519" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">politically homeless and I know Tim has</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.839" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">appeared quite a few times on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:53.729" style="s2">channel we&#39;ve done a few events together</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">and I know that you define yourselves on</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.729" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">the left as well but you also feel very</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">strongly about this topic about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">sort of sense that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">ideological frame that is very uni</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">dimensional and you&#39;re worried about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:13.020" style="s2">that effects how that can affect art and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">affect literature in particular but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:16.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to the point so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:19.230" style="s2">interested to ask well how would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.260" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">consider your political views or your</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.230" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">yeah where would you place yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">the political spectrum well in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">desperation a few years ago I came out</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">as a libertarian out of not my inability</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">to find any other word that quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">describes where I come from I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">frustrated by the whole categories of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:47.490" style="s2">left and right right now if they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">ever useful they&#39;re certainly no longer</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.490" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">when you&#39;ve got on the on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.060" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">censorious authoritarianism and on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:02:03.440" style="s2">right pounding on about freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:06.330" style="s2">speech something&#39;s got quite confused so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.440" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">the main principle of libertarianism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.330" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">just that we should be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:11.880" style="s2">whatever we want as long as it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">hurt other people I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.880" end="00:02:14.620" style="s2">pretty good principle it&#39;s certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.500" style="s2">founding Prince</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.620" end="00:02:20.230" style="s2">full of the United States it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.500" end="00:02:21.790" style="s2">that the US adheres to very well right</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.230" end="00:02:24.519" style="s2">now I don&#39;t think any any country in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.790" end="00:02:25.989" style="s2">West really believes that you should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.519" end="00:02:30.159" style="s2">able to do whatever you want if unless</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.989" end="00:02:34.540" style="s2">you hurt someone else but that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.159" end="00:02:39.069" style="s2">that I&#39;m not big on state control</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.540" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m not big on censorship and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.069" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">believe in freedom of speech even if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.280" end="00:02:52.390" style="s2">means letting people say atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:54.609" style="s2">so just to lay out the how we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.390" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">run the event tonight we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.609" end="00:02:59.769" style="s2">talk until about 8:30 we&#39;re gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:03:00.940" style="s2">break of about 20 minutes 25 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.769" end="00:03:03.700" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna come back for an audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.940" end="00:03:05.049" style="s2">Q&amp;A so anything that comes to mind while</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.700" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">we&#39;re talking just file it away and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.049" end="00:03:08.859" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an opportunity after the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:09.159" style="s2">break to to ask questions to anyone of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.859" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.159" end="00:03:13.930" style="s2">and I&#39;m also going to encourage Tim and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.030" style="s2">Lionel if you want to pick up on each</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.930" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">other&#39;s points and I&#39;ll take myself out</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.030" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">completely of the of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">but i when when thinking about this I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of a very aware with my as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:31.810" style="s2">journalist that we&#39;re we&#39;re in quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:34.379" style="s2">increasingly sort of dicey territory and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.810" end="00:03:37.450" style="s2">increasingly controversial territory so</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.379" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">there was some thought about in the back</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.450" end="00:03:41.139" style="s2">of my mind whether we should have</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">someone from the other side as it were</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.139" end="00:03:48.340" style="s2">and and then I sort of I was very aware</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:50.199" style="s2">of that process in myself of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.340" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">kind of topic that we need to have both</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.199" end="00:03:56.079" style="s2">sides represented and so I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:58.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some of the the criticisms that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.079" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">are made especially of your views on</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.060" end="00:04:01.569" style="s2">cultural appropriation so I&#39;ll I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:04.599" style="s2">place up a devil&#39;s advocate at some</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.569" end="00:04:08.620" style="s2">point in the in the evening just just to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.599" end="00:04:16.180" style="s2">put those two you have insults read to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.620" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">me sorry I think one of the points to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.180" end="00:04:20.470" style="s2">start on is so we called this the war on</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:21.820" style="s2">art and obviously we want people to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.470" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">to our event so we choose a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.820" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">slightly kind of inflammatory title a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:28.110" style="s2">little bit click Beatty and that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:30.420" style="s2">one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.110" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">comments made about this that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.420" end="00:04:36.520" style="s2">these views are pretty much just limited</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.310" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">to a few college campuses in America</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.520" end="00:04:40.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s kind of straw Manning</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">the opposition this is not a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.900" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">view so it&#39;s a lot of people getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">excited about nothing what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">of that I think there&#39;s some truth to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:55.630" style="s2">the observation that there&#39;s a shrill</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:59.350" style="s2">minority that is getting control the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.630" end="00:05:02.890" style="s2">public conversation and that&#39;s why we I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.350" end="00:05:05.500" style="s2">assume we do events like this to give a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.890" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">little pushback I think for example that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.500" end="00:05:10.540" style="s2">the so-called Millennial Generation has</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.900" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">been broadly misrepresented because in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.540" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">my experience I meet a lot of younger</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:19.390" style="s2">people who are quite reasonable and as</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">you were asked to be at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.390" end="00:05:29.050" style="s2">this event open-minded they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:31.960" style="s2">don&#39;t have opinions like look some kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.050" end="00:05:35.470" style="s2">of subscription and they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.960" end="00:05:38.980" style="s2">people and this authoritarianism I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.470" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">mentioned is coming from a minority</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.980" end="00:05:47.110" style="s2">which is really all about bullying and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:49.570" style="s2">it&#39;s all this all this calling out all</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">the shaming all the name-calling all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.570" end="00:05:55.630" style="s2">labeling is combative aggressive that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:57.490" style="s2">one of the ironies of their being so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.630" end="00:06:00.310" style="s2">concerned with microaggression what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.490" end="00:06:04.750" style="s2">you&#39;re really dealing with serious major</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.310" end="00:06:06.940" style="s2">MACUL aggression sometimes with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.750" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">express intent of losing people their</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.940" end="00:06:13.720" style="s2">jobs and making them roundly</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:15.160" style="s2">unemployable thereafter so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.720" end="00:06:19.060" style="s2">it&#39;s fair to represent a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.160" end="00:06:21.370" style="s2">generation this way but I on the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.060" end="00:06:25.150" style="s2">hand I would also say that it is spread</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.370" end="00:06:26.890" style="s2">far beyond the college campus because we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:30.610" style="s2">were just talking about that before this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.890" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">event that started the fact that both</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.610" end="00:06:35.170" style="s2">the Guardian in the New York Times have</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">changed in character drastically in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.170" end="00:06:38.180" style="s2">last five years especially in the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:42.350" style="s2">two with</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.180" end="00:06:45.639" style="s2">with the whole Trump phenomenon and have</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.350" end="00:06:50.840" style="s2">given over to much more activist</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.639" end="00:06:53.090" style="s2">indignant quarter and have lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.840" end="00:06:57.139" style="s2">integrity in the process so any any</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.090" end="00:06:59.960" style="s2">pretense of neutrality of fairness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.139" end="00:07:01.970" style="s2">and and any awareness of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.960" end="00:07:04.190" style="s2">you have that in straight reporting</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.970" end="00:07:07.190" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed having an if there</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.190" end="00:07:09.320" style="s2">paragraph so I&#39;ve watched you know</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.280" end="00:11:35.410" style="s2">story about a museum in Northumberland</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:43.540" style="s2">it was having a person of the wife of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.410" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">industrialist there or or and he was the</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:52.450" style="s2">I remember correctly and they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.350" end="00:11:55.420" style="s2">do something to celebrate his wife at</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.450" end="00:11:57.840" style="s2">this stately home but they couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.420" end="00:12:02.290" style="s2">anything that would celebrate his wife</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.840" end="00:12:04.090" style="s2">so in order to acknowledge her they</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.290" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">simply denied him and they went away</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.090" end="00:12:11.430" style="s2">around and put pillowcases over out over</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">all the busts of men and sheets over the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.430" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">paintings that were about men or by men</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:21.880" style="s2">basically they covered everything up it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:26.020" style="s2">looked as if they were moving out and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.880" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">backfired surprisingly so families paid</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.020" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">forty nine ninety five to go look at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">bunch of sheets yeah I mean that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:42.550" style="s2">one you know that&#39;s today you know and</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.550" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s going on all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.790" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">the effect of it has I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:52.150" style="s2">that&#39;s an effect that it has on museums</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:54.370" style="s2">but the effect it has on artists</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.150" end="00:12:56.170" style="s2">generally I think is very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">pernicious in so many ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.170" end="00:13:00.790" style="s2">some of them formal some of them informs</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.660" end="00:13:04.210" style="s2">on the moon tiara so on next area I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.790" end="00:13:07.390" style="s2">think they&#39;re the main enemy for artists</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.210" end="00:13:09.340" style="s2">is is I mean at being a writer is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.390" end="00:13:13.330" style="s2">incredibly insecure profession anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.340" end="00:13:14.769" style="s2">but the the temptation now to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.330" end="00:13:20.470" style="s2">fit yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.769" end="00:13:23.399" style="s2">some preordained markets which you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.470" end="00:13:25.629" style="s2">substitute the word ideological position</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.399" end="00:13:27.459" style="s2">because that&#39;s what sells and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.629" end="00:13:30.429" style="s2">what&#39;s acceptable and that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.459" end="00:13:32.799" style="s2">know publishers crucially are going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.429" end="00:13:37.059" style="s2">be interested in because publishers are</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.799" end="00:13:38.470" style="s2">very very influenced by this climate at</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.550" end="00:19:38.040" style="s2">minut degree because that story when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">came out was indeed examined on a line</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.040" end="00:19:42.900" style="s2">by line basis when it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.190" style="s2">anything to do with this one black</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.190" end="00:19:48.450" style="s2">in this regard wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.870" end="00:19:50.790" style="s2">collection is that it is too white you</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:20.130" style="s2">English which would mean by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.500" end="00:20:21.240" style="s2">we would not have the series the wire we</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.130" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the movie or the book</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:29.279" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have home assigned life on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.100" end="00:20:33.029" style="s2">street when you want to start making a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.279" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">list of the number of books and and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.029" end="00:20:41.340" style="s2">television and movie that we would not</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.100" end="00:20:51.750" style="s2">be huge and who wants to live in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.380" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">restricted universe who wants to write</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:21:02.519" style="s2">boring for the reader so I just think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:05.639" style="s2">should push back and I think writers</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.519" end="00:21:07.230" style="s2">have to push back and not because one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.639" end="00:21:09.450" style="s2">the things that&#39;s going on right now is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.230" end="00:21:11.909" style="s2">a lot of self-censorship and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.450" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">there are I feel that if I&#39;m the one who</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.909" end="00:21:19.279" style="s2">suddenly felt conscious someone like me</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:24.210" style="s2">who is pretty bulky if I&#39;m anxious about</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.279" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">having a diverse cast then a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.399" style="s2">think that&#39;s where the danger with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.130" end="00:21:40.919" style="s2">movement is we&#39;re not dealing with laws</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.399" end="00:21:43.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not dealing with legislation which</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.919" end="00:21:46.200" style="s2">is telling novelists what they can and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.380" end="00:21:51.299" style="s2">cannot write but when you comply with</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.260" end="00:21:59.519" style="s2">yeah just to pick up on one thing this</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">this is very paradoxical that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.519" end="00:22:05.049" style="s2">outcome of this kind of this worldview</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:07.090" style="s2">is that there may be fewer</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.090" end="00:22:10.659" style="s2">kind of literary apartheid like if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.369" end="00:22:11.860" style="s2">can only write about your experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.659" end="00:22:14.470" style="s2">then suddenly you filled your books up</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.860" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">with with with only white characters or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.470" end="00:22:20.649" style="s2">only characters who look exactly like</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.649" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">on it goes on to how the characters</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.629" end="00:22:30.970" style="s2">arbitrate are portrayed not just about</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.159" end="00:29:22.730" style="s2">so I am NOT interested in understanding</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.090" end="00:29:53.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the answer is to seize on</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.210" end="00:30:56.419" style="s2">I moved to Britain I&#39;ve been in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.400" end="00:30:58.789" style="s2">for the last 30-some years so I got out</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.419" end="00:31:01.480" style="s2">and I think my life has been a great</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.670" end="00:33:29.240" style="s2">very difficult road I mean I would say</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.920" end="00:33:32.370" style="s2">as well as someone on the left obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.240" end="00:33:34.410" style="s2">you would have thought racism or you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.370" end="00:33:37.320" style="s2">would you would have seen racism problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.410" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">how do you swear that sort of holding on</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.320" end="00:33:42.690" style="s2">to some of those values of the left but</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">not going down the route of identity</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.690" end="00:33:50.010" style="s2">politics and and this kind of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.010" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">few heretical thoughts as I sit here</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.680" style="s2">about the whole idea of identity</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">politics because I was just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.680" end="00:34:01.170" style="s2">think just answer your question but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:02.790" style="s2">it interests me anyway but um I was it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.170" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">was I come from a working-class</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.790" end="00:34:09.149" style="s2">background and so Devon and I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">you know and at a time when the working</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.149" end="00:34:15.990" style="s2">class were ascendant as a voice to some</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">extent in film and TV and there were</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.990" end="00:34:20.100" style="s2">people like the angry young men in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:23.070" style="s2">50s but that was that was younger me but</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.100" end="00:34:24.300" style="s2">I mean older than me rather and then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.070" end="00:34:26.640" style="s2">but then there were the kitchen sink</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.300" end="00:34:30.060" style="s2">dramas of the sixties and seventies and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.640" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">there Ken Loach&#39;s cares was a film I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.060" end="00:34:33.600" style="s2">remember I remember the white working</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:35.840" style="s2">class which I suppose is my identity</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.600" end="00:34:41.669" style="s2">originally it&#39;s not really much anymore</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.840" end="00:34:44.220" style="s2">but it&#39;s where I came from sorry and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.669" end="00:34:47.970" style="s2">know I also remember times and get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.220" end="00:34:51.500" style="s2">gut to date today even where I think of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.970" end="00:34:54.840" style="s2">the depictions of working-class people</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.950" end="00:35:05.370" style="s2">and how kind of unconvincing I find them</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.190" end="00:35:09.660" style="s2">and how annoying I find that the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.370" end="00:35:15.750" style="s2">that they&#39;re not actually using the</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:50.580" style="s2">that seems qualitatively different from</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.660" end="00:40:20.370" style="s2">there&#39;s such things bad dialogue and bad</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.370" end="00:40:27.650" style="s2">portrayals that&#39;s what Tim was talking</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.650" end="00:40:32.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing wrong with saying</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.080" end="00:40:51.300" style="s2">is the right to try you know to make an</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.290" end="00:40:54.030" style="s2">effort and that it doesn&#39;t think that</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.410" end="00:41:09.630" style="s2">we should also have the right to say you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.420" end="00:41:13.560" style="s2">know that that character is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.630" end="00:41:15.560" style="s2">that accent is rendered badly that</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.560" end="00:41:21.690" style="s2">would never I think say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.050" end="00:41:25.110" style="s2">it&#39;s and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.110" end="00:41:32.370" style="s2">as respect it has to do with a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.809" end="00:41:48.910" style="s2">matter of persuading people that these</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.329" end="00:41:52.869" style="s2">these characters you&#39;ve made up after</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.869" end="00:41:59.589" style="s2">they they form a the achieve a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.589" end="00:42:06.999" style="s2">they don&#39;t really deserve so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.039" end="00:42:09.249" style="s2">skill there&#39;s a sneaky little skill to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.999" end="00:42:12.220" style="s2">making people seem real and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.249" end="00:42:15.339" style="s2">think it means respecting them exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.220" end="00:42:19.299" style="s2">and it and if you&#39;re going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.339" end="00:42:21.579" style="s2">character work then it needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.299" end="00:42:25.980" style="s2">very individual character and not just</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.579" end="00:42:29.470" style="s2">be some character that that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.980" end="00:42:32.470" style="s2">plausible representative of their of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.470" end="00:42:34.239" style="s2">their people you know needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.470" end="00:42:35.470" style="s2">someone in particular that&#39;s one things</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.239" end="00:42:37.989" style="s2">that&#39;s so great about the wire just</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.470" end="00:42:40.029" style="s2">because that came up good example those</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.989" end="00:42:43.019" style="s2">characters are very individual and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.029" end="00:42:45.220" style="s2">they&#39;re great and they&#39;re memorable and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.019" end="00:42:51.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not just a bunch of black people</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.220" end="00:42:54.119" style="s2">being black and so yes there&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.519" end="00:42:57.809" style="s2">thing as being good at your job and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.119" end="00:43:01.089" style="s2">those are those are the writers that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.809" end="00:43:03.489" style="s2">basically get away with murder because</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.089" end="00:43:08.559" style="s2">their characters no more exists than</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.489" end="00:43:11.829" style="s2">anyone else&#39;s but they they perform a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.559" end="00:43:16.059" style="s2">con job on the audience that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.829" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">effective and I want to sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.059" end="00:43:20.019" style="s2">just end you&#39;ve got about five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:21.970" style="s2">before we take a break by saying where</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.019" end="00:43:23.880" style="s2">where does this all go and what are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.970" end="00:43:26.289" style="s2">concerned about where it might go</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.880" end="00:43:27.789" style="s2">because it seemed that this - there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.289" end="00:43:30.069" style="s2">two different attitudes that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.789" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">take - for example someone writing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.069" end="00:43:38.559" style="s2">novel as a character one which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:40.739" style="s2">you&#39;ve got or you didn&#39;t you open it</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.559" end="00:43:40.739" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.080" end="00:43:45.400" style="s2">tential to learn more about someone else</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.840" end="00:43:47.290" style="s2">experience all there&#39;s the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.400" end="00:43:48.100" style="s2">of you should not even attempt this in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.290" end="00:43:50.710" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.100" end="00:43:53.980" style="s2">it seems to me that that perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.710" end="00:43:56.410" style="s2">profoundly anti-human like it denies the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.980" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">possibility of empathy or of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:44:02.380" style="s2">communication I what I fear is that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:05.110" style="s2">ends up with us completely sido for each</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.380" end="00:44:07.120" style="s2">other and that that&#39;s very concerning I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.110" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">think it may start with sort of good</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.120" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">intentions but what it the place that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">ends up is almost guaranteeing some form</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">of conflict because it denies the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">possibility of true connection across</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:29.590" style="s2">whatever boundaries so slightly sidestep</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:31.840" style="s2">that points though I think it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.590" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">touch on it because while you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.840" end="00:44:38.590" style="s2">I was thinking about something important</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">about a kind of direct now that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.590" end="00:44:49.990" style="s2">saying what you and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:55.210" style="s2">mean that about a concrete example of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.990" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">how censorship or not even central</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.210" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">climate is invidious to us I just just</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:03.820" style="s2">popped into my head I will try</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:06.460" style="s2">continental name of the program as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.820" end="00:45:10.510" style="s2">drama mother was on a year or two back</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.460" end="00:45:12.280" style="s2">about a about a man and a woman showing</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.510" end="00:45:14.980" style="s2">from both the men and the woman&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.280" end="00:45:18.030" style="s2">of view about who had been telling the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.980" end="00:45:22.780" style="s2">truth about whether she was raped or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.030" end="00:45:24.610" style="s2">liar liar I think it was called no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.780" end="00:45:28.600" style="s2">called like in school though I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.610" end="00:45:32.290" style="s2">not some another anyway in the end it</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.600" end="00:45:33.940" style="s2">turned out the guy was lying and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.290" end="00:45:36.370" style="s2">was a piece of the spectator which I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.940" end="00:45:38.200" style="s2">thought was absolutely right said of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.370" end="00:45:40.840" style="s2">course the guy was right they could not</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.200" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">have ended it any other way it would not</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.840" end="00:45:46.690" style="s2">have been allowed and that&#39;s what was</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">because once you start having that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.690" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">thread in the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:56.150" style="s2">you know it just becomes boring there</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:59.540" style="s2">was a kind of time when black characters</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.150" end="00:46:01.609" style="s2">are represented in movies as pimps and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.540" end="00:46:03.859" style="s2">gangsters you know we had to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.609" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">that then they became represented always</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.859" end="00:46:08.840" style="s2">good guys and so okay which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:10.520" style="s2">where we&#39;ve somewhat stayed you know I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.840" end="00:46:12.440" style="s2">think we need to get a point where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.520" end="00:46:14.030" style="s2">say these are all people you know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.440" end="00:46:16.369" style="s2">you can get you know there are bad</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.619" end="00:46:43.130" style="s2">and I probably be scared too but I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:45.859" style="s2">when I was I also did got a column for</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.130" end="00:46:47.510" style="s2">The Guardian until recently and about my</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.859" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">family in one of the things that came up</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.510" end="00:46:55.970" style="s2">I was bullied and there was a survey</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:57.859" style="s2">that so I found a big survey on bullying</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.970" end="00:47:00.440" style="s2">you know they didn&#39;t take a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.859" end="00:47:02.510" style="s2">year&#39;s economy around the Pacific server</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.440" end="00:47:06.170" style="s2">and you know they then they broke it</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.510" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">down so are you male are you female are</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.170" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">you gay I&#39;m trans you know and and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:15.500" style="s2">know and they asked some questions like</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:17.210" style="s2">have you been bullied and they would</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.500" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">also ask questions like have you bullied</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.210" end="00:47:22.820" style="s2">anybody and that was the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:24.500" style="s2">question because and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.820" end="00:47:26.060" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen followed up anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.500" end="00:47:28.580" style="s2">anyone used a journalist who may feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.060" end="00:47:31.190" style="s2">free to do so is that they found out</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.580" end="00:47:34.300" style="s2">that you know boys were slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">likely to bully in girls something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.300" end="00:47:39.619" style="s2">you know quite high I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.619" style="s2">something about you know twenty thirty</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.619" end="00:47:44.599" style="s2">percent of boys and girls admitted</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.619" end="00:47:47.810" style="s2">privately they had bullied another</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.599" end="00:47:52.250" style="s2">person and and gay people were roughly</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.810" end="00:47:55.220" style="s2">the same trans kids were like seventy</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.250" end="00:47:57.130" style="s2">five percent of them said that they had</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.220" end="00:48:00.080" style="s2">bullied which I thought was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.130" end="00:48:02.570" style="s2">remarkable you know and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.080" end="00:48:03.530" style="s2">was not what I expected at all in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.570" end="00:48:05.120" style="s2">survey there also</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.530" end="00:48:08.390" style="s2">said that huge number have been bullied</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.120" end="00:48:10.700" style="s2">but they&#39;re also bullied and that just</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.390" end="00:48:13.430" style="s2">made me think you know what with every</p>

<p begin="00:54:13.450" end="00:54:19.940" style="s2">when men dress up as women or women</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.080" end="00:54:22.070" style="s2">dress up as men we&#39;re thinking supposed</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.940" end="00:54:23.900" style="s2">to think that&#39;s great I guess that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.620" end="01:06:43.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s taken sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.780" end="01:06:47.450" style="s2">this long before the word religion has</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.880" end="01:06:48.830" style="s2">kind of been brought up because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.450" end="01:06:50.870" style="s2">very interesting part of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.830" end="01:06:55.340" style="s2">this this ideology that it does seem</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.870" end="01:06:56.750" style="s2">very religious in tone I know you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.340" end="01:07:00.920" style="s2">mentioned something like that when we</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.750" end="01:07:02.510" style="s2">did our interview a few months ago yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.920" end="01:07:11.180" style="s2">I mentioned earlier this evening as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.510" end="01:07:13.640" style="s2">but and that question it&#39;s beautiful the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.180" end="01:07:17.240" style="s2">gentleman mentioned Salem of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.640" end="01:07:21.980" style="s2">which is which trial conducted by the</p>

<p begin="01:07:32.690" end="01:07:38.660" style="s2">the time and it&#39;s all really there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.260" end="01:07:40.070" style="s2">kinds of religion there&#39;s the declared</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.660" end="01:07:43.220" style="s2">religions and the undeclared of</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.070" end="01:07:45.410" style="s2">religions secularism is another kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.220" end="01:07:49.490" style="s2">declared undeclared religion in some</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.410" end="01:07:54.740" style="s2">ways and certainly the social justice</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.490" end="01:07:57.610" style="s2">warriors and radical left have always</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.740" end="01:08:03.110" style="s2">been a kind of undeclared religion</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.610" end="01:08:05.000" style="s2">whether it&#39;s now or Stalin or you know</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.310" end="01:08:24.409" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.589" end="01:08:27.170" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing people scrambling around to</p>

<p begin="01:10:05.570" end="01:10:10.639" style="s2">I mean you know if there are 12% ethnic</p>

<p begin="01:11:38.260" end="01:11:41.770" style="s2">going so I could show you statistics on</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.940" end="01:11:44.010" style="s2">that you know and that&#39;s becomes</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.770" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">measurable and its enormous ly</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.010" end="01:11:52.030" style="s2">comforting to people of a bureaucratic</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.030" end="01:11:56.710" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my more general and</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.760" end="01:11:59.320" style="s2">high-minded reason for posing the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.710" end="01:12:02.199" style="s2">one is that when they&#39;re out trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.320" end="01:12:05.230" style="s2">sell the screenplay of my new novel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.199" end="01:12:07.810" style="s2">like we&#39;re not interested in anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.230" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">is a white middle-aged man and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.810" end="01:12:12.460" style="s2">no one wants to look at it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:14.349" style="s2">interested in paying writers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.460" end="01:12:18.670" style="s2">interested in women but if you think</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.349" end="01:12:21.460" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get your adapted you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.670" end="01:12:24.639" style="s2">know it&#39;s just not going to happen now</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.460" end="01:12:27.429" style="s2">that&#39;s my selfish reason it&#39;s I seems a</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.639" end="01:12:30.010" style="s2">bit unfair could be a book I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.429" end="01:12:32.340" style="s2">know but then Mike could be it could be</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.010" end="01:12:35.079" style="s2">expressive but but the idea that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.340" end="01:12:39.340" style="s2">putting myself aside and not something I</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.079" end="01:12:43.960" style="s2">like to do but if I if I did</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.340" end="01:12:46.780" style="s2">come back to me again I would I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.960" end="01:12:50.920" style="s2">really worried that this idea of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.780" end="01:12:57.219" style="s2">very intangible idea that is lodged in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.920" end="01:12:58.929" style="s2">in a culture impossible to quantify that</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.219" end="01:13:01.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of and it&#39;s very elitist</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.929" end="01:13:04.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem it&#39;s very elitist</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.030" end="01:13:07.380" style="s2">because it relies on certain people with</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.360" end="01:13:10.810" style="s2">what we also can&#39;t quantify called taste</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.380" end="01:13:14.650" style="s2">you know and and and artistic</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.810" end="01:13:17.260" style="s2">sensitivity and and cultural insights</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.650" end="01:13:19.449" style="s2">can&#39;t measure any of these things you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.260" end="01:13:21.909" style="s2">know there was it was just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.449" end="01:13:24.250" style="s2">once upon a time people take a crack at</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.909" end="01:13:27.099" style="s2">it just because it was interesting now</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.250" end="01:13:28.989" style="s2">in a place where we can we you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.099" end="01:13:36.190" style="s2">part of the box ticking culture where we</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.989" end="01:13:39.400" style="s2">can say the following characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.190" end="01:13:40.630" style="s2">and I can you know why you asked me if</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.400" end="01:13:42.550" style="s2">it&#39;s any good I mean that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.630" end="01:13:44.969" style="s2">point is it you know yeah it is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.550" end="01:13:47.619" style="s2"> point</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.969" end="01:13:49.389" style="s2">so I think we&#39;ve got time for two more</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.619" end="01:13:56.650" style="s2">questions so I think you had your hand</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.389" end="01:13:58.300" style="s2">up before so I mean thank you for this</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.650" end="01:13:59.800" style="s2">really interesting and I agree with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.300" end="01:14:02.409" style="s2">lot of what you say I agree when he you</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.800" end="01:14:04.389" style="s2">aren&#39;t Sweeney truth all of that and we</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.409" end="01:14:06.849" style="s2">need complexity and openness but I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.389" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">the concern I have is sometimes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.849" end="01:14:10.270" style="s2">talking about this we&#39;re ignoring the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:13.480" style="s2">real dangers that there are in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.270" end="01:14:16.060" style="s2">right now of for example when you talk</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.480" end="01:14:17.770" style="s2">about arts you&#39;re both artists that come</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.060" end="01:14:19.659" style="s2">to it from a place of good faith you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.770" end="01:14:21.909" style="s2">hear you&#39;re trying to write and to</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.659" end="01:14:24.010" style="s2">create art in a way that&#39;s getting to a</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.909" end="01:14:25.869" style="s2">greater truth but there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.010" end="01:14:27.670" style="s2">use art in a very different way and one</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.869" end="01:14:29.050" style="s2">example of that obviously is you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.670" end="01:14:31.480" style="s2">the thing we&#39;ve just seen about grenfell</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.050" end="01:14:33.639" style="s2">that&#39;s arguably piece of arts which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.480" end="01:14:35.230" style="s2">done in order to incite hatred and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.639" end="01:14:36.790" style="s2">that&#39;s something that we&#39;re seeing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.230" end="01:14:39.730" style="s2">growing and it&#39;s dangerous and if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.790" end="01:14:41.440" style="s2">come from a background that because it</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.730" end="01:14:45.960" style="s2">creates hatred and we&#39;ve seen in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.440" end="01:14:45.960" style="s2">past okay fine</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.020" end="01:14:58.680" style="s2">why is that dangerous okay if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.860" end="01:15:00.780" style="s2">you come from a community which is going</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.680" end="01:15:02.580" style="s2">which is which is gonna be the subject</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.780" end="01:15:04.410" style="s2">of hate because it helps repel someone</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.580" end="01:15:07.230" style="s2">else in Trump&#39;s case for example a</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.410" end="01:15:09.180" style="s2">populist you can become demonized and we</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.230" end="01:15:10.530" style="s2">know in other countries what happens</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.180" end="01:15:13.080" style="s2">when you demonize people if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.530" end="01:15:15.180" style="s2">Rwanda the use of demonizing certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.080" end="01:15:16.560" style="s2">groups was used to strengthen other</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.180" end="01:15:18.390" style="s2">groups and that ultimately led to</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.560" end="01:15:20.880" style="s2">violence that&#39;s the lesson of history so</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.390" end="01:15:22.800" style="s2">I mean for me seeing that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.880" end="01:15:26.550" style="s2">happened without recognizing the dangers</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.800" end="01:15:27.930" style="s2">inherent in that it&#39;s problematic okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.550" end="01:15:30.890" style="s2">let me just get this straight you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.930" end="01:15:33.210" style="s2">think that burning a paper</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.890" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">representation of a building is going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.210" end="01:15:42.600" style="s2">lead to our machete in each other in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:43.620" style="s2">streets respect I&#39;m speaking to you with</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.600" end="01:15:45.030" style="s2">respect and I&#39;m listening to everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.620" end="01:15:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I believe in a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.030" end="01:15:49.470" style="s2">you&#39;re saying but you know that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.520" end="01:15:52.260" style="s2">as simple as that right you know that</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.470" end="01:15:54.870" style="s2">that you start off by mocking people by</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.260" end="01:15:57.570" style="s2">making them less by making them the</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.870" end="01:15:59.430" style="s2">target of hate in some way and yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.570" end="01:16:02.160" style="s2">burning burning a piece of art is a way</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.430" end="01:16:06.660" style="s2">of minimizing them of making them of</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.160" end="01:16:08.430" style="s2">making them some it demonstrates them</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.660" end="01:16:10.850" style="s2">being less than other parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.430" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">community it&#39;s it&#39;s an easy way of</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.850" end="01:16:16.800" style="s2">transferring kind of distracting people</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:18.870" style="s2">from what you&#39;re doing by demonizing</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.800" end="01:16:20.130" style="s2">this other group and that an art can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.870" end="01:16:23.460" style="s2">used in that way and you can laugh at</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.130" end="01:16:26.540" style="s2">that you can you can laugh right but</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.460" end="01:16:29.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.540" end="01:16:30.810" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s your perception but</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.100" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">that&#39;s your perception that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.810" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.030" end="01:16:41.519" style="s2">all right I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.320" end="01:16:45.030" style="s2">here unusually um I found that case very</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.519" end="01:16:48.869" style="s2">interesting now it isn&#39;t really a piece</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.030" end="01:16:50.460" style="s2">of art but let&#39;s see it was you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.869" end="01:16:52.860" style="s2">what&#39;s called a piece of art I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.460" end="01:16:55.260" style="s2">maybe they think of it as art it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.860" end="01:16:57.449" style="s2">arbitrary category the question is</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.260" end="01:17:01.979" style="s2">whether or not those I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.449" end="01:17:06.300" style="s2">mostly kids wasn&#39;t it because with some</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.979" end="01:17:07.969" style="s2">adults - okay alright uh yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.300" end="01:17:12.989" style="s2">even care who did it</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.969" end="01:17:16.409" style="s2">interestingly though interestingly the</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.989" end="01:17:20.099" style="s2">cops are unable to pin any crime on</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.409" end="01:17:23.579" style="s2">these people it&#39;s not a hate crime</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.099" end="01:17:26.489" style="s2">because it that that disaster did not</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.579" end="01:17:29.789" style="s2">belong to one of those specific</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.489" end="01:17:33.710" style="s2">protected categories of people so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.789" end="01:17:33.710" style="s2">an interesting it&#39;s an interesting case</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.969" end="01:17:40.940" style="s2">now look I am the first person to admit</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:44.130" style="s2">that was an excruciating ly poor taste</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.940" end="01:17:47.090" style="s2">but I think it should be legal I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.130" end="01:17:50.340" style="s2">think those people should be in jail and</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.090" end="01:17:54.780" style="s2">we could call it a piece of art we could</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.340" end="01:17:57.809" style="s2">call it just an act of demonstrating how</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.780" end="01:18:01.320" style="s2">thick and crass you are but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.809" end="01:18:05.909" style="s2">illegal to be thick god most of Britain</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.320" end="01:18:09.539" style="s2">would be in jail and it&#39;s not illegal to</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.909" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">be crass it&#39;s not believe it or not</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.539" end="01:18:14.579" style="s2">illegal to be racist and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.679" end="01:18:16.860" style="s2">one of the things we have to get our</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.579" end="01:18:20.369" style="s2">heads around because you know we all</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.860" end="01:18:22.409" style="s2">have prejudices we all we all approach</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.369" end="01:18:24.780" style="s2">each other with little categories in our</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.409" end="01:18:27.059" style="s2">minds and little preconceived notions</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.780" end="01:18:28.920" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re they&#39;re too positive</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.059" end="01:18:31.619" style="s2">oh you know the Asian over there he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.920" end="01:18:35.369" style="s2">good at math and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.619" end="01:18:38.579" style="s2">prejudice but prejudice is not against</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.369" end="01:18:45.409" style="s2">the law and I think we are we are losing</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.579" end="01:18:48.019" style="s2">a distinction between social</p>

<p begin="01:19:30.079" end="01:19:36.860" style="s2">that make me uneasy and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.099" end="01:19:40.010" style="s2">simple because one can remember back to</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.860" end="01:19:44.169" style="s2">the thirties and dished in the Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.010" end="01:19:48.530" style="s2">press who were publishing articles that</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.169" end="01:19:52.369" style="s2">vilified Jews they&#39;re sending burning</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.349" end="01:20:00.159" style="s2">argument that if one allows hate out</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.530" end="01:20:03.229" style="s2">there it&#39;s going to have some terrible</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.159" end="01:20:07.189" style="s2">consequences and it&#39;s always a question</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.229" end="01:20:12.019" style="s2">of balancing these rights I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.189" end="01:20:14.989" style="s2">I&#39;m a hundred percent behind Lionel in</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.019" end="01:20:17.479" style="s2">in the idea that this is this is you</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.989" end="01:20:19.880" style="s2">know Varnum pathetic but when I heard</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.479" end="01:20:26.150" style="s2">that six people have been arrested over</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.880" end="01:20:28.280" style="s2">it it really sent chills up my spine you</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.159" end="01:20:40.130" style="s2">who&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s also part of the the</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.639" end="01:20:43.189" style="s2">what you might call the shift in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.130" end="01:20:47.749" style="s2">definition of hurt you know and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.189" end="01:20:51.499" style="s2">if I had a relative at grenfell who died</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.749" end="01:20:56.929" style="s2">and fly be extremely hurt by what they</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.499" end="01:20:58.760" style="s2">had done and offended and upset but I</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.929" end="01:21:01.640" style="s2">just can&#39;t live with that definition</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.760" end="01:21:04.220" style="s2">I can&#39;t live with it and anything we can</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.640" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">live with as a society because once we</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.220" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">go down that road of psychological hurt</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:12.200" style="s2">amounting to a crime I just don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:15.020" style="s2">where that ends you know now I I just</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.200" end="01:21:17.510" style="s2">think you&#39;re on a terrifying Road I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.020" end="01:21:18.770" style="s2">I really sympathize anyone who lost</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.510" end="01:21:22.120" style="s2">someone in that building to having to</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.770" end="01:21:25.790" style="s2">watch that but as Lionel says there are</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.120" end="01:21:27.739" style="s2">there are crude stupid and and wicked</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.790" end="01:21:32.020" style="s2">people out there and we can&#39;t lock them</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.739" end="01:21:36.320" style="s2">all up and and and that that that whole</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.020" end="01:21:38.300" style="s2">you know I I mean if they they were you</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.320" end="01:21:39.650" style="s2">know and it&#39;s it&#39;s not an easy answer I</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.300" end="01:21:41.630" style="s2">mean I there was that story about</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.650" end="01:21:45.830" style="s2">countdown kilo and his dog that did the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.630" end="01:21:47.000" style="s2">Nazi salute and and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.830" end="01:21:48.920" style="s2">know there was something about that man</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.000" end="01:21:51.680" style="s2">made me uneasy as well I don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.920" end="01:21:53.090" style="s2">uneasy because he was a he was arrested</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.680" end="01:21:54.590" style="s2">I mean I was definitely uneasy about</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.090" end="01:21:55.640" style="s2">that but I was also very uneasy about</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.590" end="01:21:57.590" style="s2">what he was doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.640" end="01:21:59.090" style="s2">not so much teaching a dog or nicely</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.590" end="01:22:01.280" style="s2">salute but it was what he was said he</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.090" end="01:22:05.380" style="s2">said gas the Jews and it was like</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.280" end="01:22:05.380" style="s2">something about that phrase that I found</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.180" end="01:22:12.860" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t even I hate the Jews it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.610" end="01:22:16.489" style="s2">gas the Jews you know it seems such an</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.860" end="01:22:18.710" style="s2">extreme it doesn&#39;t sit now I&#39;m sure but</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.489" end="01:22:20.840" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s better than gas the Jews</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.710" end="01:22:23.120" style="s2">somehow you know keeping out keep an eye</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.840" end="01:22:25.100" style="s2">on him yeah I mean the trouble is you do</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.120" end="01:22:28.400" style="s2">you do have to you do have to put up</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.100" end="01:22:29.780" style="s2">with a lot of as Lionel said a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:31.489" style="s2">assholes in the world you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.780" end="01:22:33.050" style="s2">can&#39;t lock them all up and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.489" end="01:22:35.090" style="s2">once you start looking there and also</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.050" end="01:22:37.400" style="s2">there&#39;s always the problem of who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.090" end="01:22:39.860" style="s2">asshole you know who defines an asshole</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.400" end="01:22:41.000" style="s2">you know and and once you&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.860" end="01:22:42.970" style="s2">know you at the moment we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.000" end="01:22:46.660" style="s2">political climate it was quiet</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.970" end="01:22:50.480" style="s2">stringently I would say you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.660" end="01:22:53.000" style="s2">left-wing in terms of social positioning</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.480" end="01:22:55.250" style="s2">but if you switch that and and it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.000" end="01:22:57.950" style="s2">the right-wing who were defining what</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.250" end="01:22:59.989" style="s2">was exception and what wasn&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.950" end="01:23:02.420" style="s2">you would be you know in dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.989" end="01:23:04.610" style="s2">ground if you if you had someone like if</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.420" end="01:23:06.920" style="s2">you had someone like Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.610" end="01:23:10.280" style="s2">you know who&#39;s America is protected by</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.920" end="01:23:11.930" style="s2">free speech laws which were not saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.280" end="01:23:12.580" style="s2">you know what I find it offensive that</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.930" end="01:23:14.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.580" end="01:23:16.900" style="s2">you presume that you present these</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.200" end="01:23:19.570" style="s2">left-wing opinions against abortion for</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.900" end="01:23:22.210" style="s2">instance or in favor of abortion and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.570" end="01:23:24.070" style="s2">want to suppress that because I consider</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.210" end="01:23:26.230" style="s2">it to be wrong and immoral and in favor</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.070" end="01:23:27.070" style="s2">of murdering people even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.230" end="01:23:30.730" style="s2">very small</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.070" end="01:23:32.260" style="s2">you know incipient people who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.730" end="01:23:34.510" style="s2">the defining you know and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.260" end="01:23:37.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the real danger but I take your</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.510" end="01:23:40.420" style="s2">point completely and I you know I it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.090" end="01:23:42.660" style="s2">horrible thing but between justice in</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.420" end="01:23:45.390" style="s2">the law there&#39;s quite a big gap I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.660" end="01:23:49.060" style="s2">but thank you for your question</p>

<p begin="01:23:54.310" end="01:23:57.190" style="s2">energy in the room and I think we</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.510" end="01:24:00.460" style="s2">definitely should do more of these</p>
