<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">you&#39;re vectoring into all of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">whatever this is part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:04.790" style="s2">gonna discuss is what all of this is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">just using big hand gestures right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.790" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">yeah so you can yeah like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.130" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">come into this and what you see your</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">role to be what would you like your role</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">to be etc sure I&#39;ll use a phrase that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">used with layman the other day because</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s actually from a book about</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">about think tanks but relegated</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:31.130" style="s2">autonomous sociologists I&#39;m a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">Perak academic and go against the grain</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.130" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">you know very very critical from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">radical tradition that studied political</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">sociology and international relations</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">and political sociology is about</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">actually the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:47.689" style="s2">knowledge and power and elites and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">masses so that that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.689" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">international relations open my eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:57.540" style="s2">then political sociology helped give me</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">laser vision to sort of focus in on you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.540" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">know this these particular issues it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">really you know that took me to the cusp</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">of post-modernism and discourse and all</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">these things and paradigm shift and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">where we&#39;re going so I&#39;ve been on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">path for about 10 years and interest</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter modernism and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">connected with meta moderna in 2016 and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s been a it&#39;s been a real treat</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">but also a lot of frustration to to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:29.370" style="s2">to have a community to be involved with</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">and to see what that&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.370" end="00:02:37.170" style="s2">experience the different ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">frictions and hierarchies and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.170" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">how we how we mitigate that and so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:47.420" style="s2">of my critique is has taken me you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:50.130" style="s2">in some ways back to post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.420" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">necessarily and my side view article</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.130" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">actually goes into that yeah hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of kept me on the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:06.980" style="s2">edge uh you know of critiquing those</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:09.270" style="s2">that I admire and and care about and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.980" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">you know including people I work with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.270" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">and including the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:17.190" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about yes and and back</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">back to meta modernism you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.190" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">this project and where are we going and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">how can we how can we I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:26.580" style="s2">process so we&#39;re not gonna get there so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">to speak but how can we recursively</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.580" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">iterate the process so that I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">this is a good segue that I mean I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">talked to layman Pascal that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:41.910" style="s2">layman he was referring to and and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">talked to him about this question and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.910" end="00:03:46.410" style="s2">christmukkah Pietro and I are writing an</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">article for apology that layman is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.410" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">helping to supervise and I believe Brent</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">is also contributing to that as well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve also done some things as Brett</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">mentioned on the online journal the side</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.730" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">view but what this long preamble is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">say I have some sense and I have a book</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">that Brett recommended it&#39;s arrived they</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">haven&#39;t started reading it but since we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:13.950" style="s2">have Brent here what&#39;s what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">on this notion of meta modernism what</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.950" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">what what do you hear when you hear that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:25.080" style="s2">word what does it mean to you and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">happening in it right now yeah what when</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.080" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">I first came across it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">it was you know roughly the time I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:35.100" style="s2">at grad school in London ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">when vermeulen and van Acker were were</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.100" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">doing their work and I really had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">sense of it myself but I couldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">know I was so far from articulating it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">it was just such a big big idea what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.150" style="s2">was in going in going around in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">sociology department saying we need a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.150" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">meta turn you know I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:57.810" style="s2">and there was also like like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">complexity kind of think tank at at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.810" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">London School of Economics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">it had been like shut down or defunded</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:07.170" style="s2">or something and at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:11.160" style="s2">Arab Spring was happening and and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.170" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">and occupy and at the same time also in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.160" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">within this year the director of LSE</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.150" end="00:05:20.430" style="s2">kind of resigned in shame because he had</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:23.880" style="s2">taken money from Gaddafi it&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.430" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">let his son study there and so just</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.880" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">where I was at you know politically and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:31.080" style="s2">intellectually all these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:35.370" style="s2">intersected and I did my dissertation on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.080" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">the zeitgeist movement and so that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:40.710" style="s2">know that that brought up this concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">of con spirituality which was also of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.710" end="00:05:46.260" style="s2">the time and kind of the the merging of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">New Age and conspiracy and so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.260" end="00:05:52.380" style="s2">saw this convergence and it and and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2">know I was on the edge of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.380" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">things like Joe Jack and Foucault and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:05:59.220" style="s2">and and discourse and you know just</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:03.480" style="s2">again wondering wondering where it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.220" end="00:06:05.880" style="s2">all gonna go and and how we could you</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.480" end="00:06:07.830" style="s2">know translate it because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:09.330" style="s2">the language you know postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.830" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">gibberish is the kind of expression</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.330" end="00:06:14.130" style="s2">right so of academic language can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">very alienating so you want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.130" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">you ask the question like what is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">really about how can we get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:25.560" style="s2">and so you know more language was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">nested within academic subfields and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.560" end="00:06:29.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t really do anything right it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:32.280" style="s2">impotent and so in some ways a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.730" end="00:06:34.820" style="s2">this anticipates what happened you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.280" end="00:06:40.230" style="s2">with with the intellectual dark web and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.820" end="00:06:41.419" style="s2">anti post-modernism hmm where where was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.230" end="00:06:45.929" style="s2">I going with</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.419" end="00:06:48.899" style="s2">what was your question again oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.929" end="00:06:50.999" style="s2">yeah right yeah so so so just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.899" end="00:06:54.239" style="s2">fast forward you know I kept developing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.999" end="00:06:56.459" style="s2">my own ideas and from 2010 to 2015</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.239" end="00:06:58.889" style="s2">you could google searching and you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.459" end="00:07:01.050" style="s2">not find a lot about this term right</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.889" end="00:07:03.119" style="s2">really very little so so there was no</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.050" end="00:07:06.269" style="s2">discourse to sink your teeth into and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.119" end="00:07:07.889" style="s2">then I discovered a meta moderna right</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.269" end="00:07:09.899" style="s2">this kind of thing tanked and they they</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.889" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">hadn&#39;t yet published their book but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.899" end="00:07:13.860" style="s2">they were publishing articles and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:15.709" style="s2">thought that was fantastic you know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.860" end="00:07:18.979" style="s2">think Hansie does a great job of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.709" end="00:07:21.629" style="s2">abstracting what this paradigm is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.979" end="00:07:24.119" style="s2">there&#39;s some heuristic shortcuts taken</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.629" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">but I was ok with all of it you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.119" end="00:07:29.159" style="s2">on board the whole the whole modern post</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:31.289" style="s2">modern meta modern thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.159" end="00:07:33.419" style="s2">entirely arbitrary but it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.289" end="00:07:36.209" style="s2">slippery right there&#39;s other ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.419" end="00:07:38.579" style="s2">frame this you know because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.209" end="00:07:40.829" style="s2">other terms there&#39;s there these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.579" end="00:07:42.979" style="s2">are nested the fractal</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.829" end="00:07:45.479" style="s2">I think Hansie gets all this but he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.979" end="00:07:48.869" style="s2">simplifies it for the sake of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.479" end="00:07:52.139" style="s2">system building right so so I got</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.869" end="00:07:54.990" style="s2">involved with them so you know to a book</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.139" end="00:07:57.269" style="s2">called The Listening Society right by</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.990" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">Hans e frying act and he&#39;s got two books</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.269" end="00:08:02.669" style="s2">out now and it&#39;s you know part of a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:05.309" style="s2">term vision and series and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.669" end="00:08:08.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s going well and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.309" end="00:08:09.419" style="s2">they they took inspiration from what</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.039" end="00:08:11.550" style="s2">Vermeil and and van de knacker were</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.419" end="00:08:14.669" style="s2">writing about culture and so did I with</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.550" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">my film the abstract in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.669" end="00:08:20.969" style="s2">know metafiction and sincere irony and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:23.009" style="s2">all these things so so the discourse was</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.969" end="00:08:28.769" style="s2">was working but it was still very</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.009" end="00:08:29.819" style="s2">nascent right very very young and so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.769" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">know getting involved with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.819" end="00:08:33.659" style="s2">community was interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.050" end="00:08:39.000" style="s2">different people had different ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.659" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">lack of ideas and um Hansie kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.000" end="00:08:43.169" style="s2">you know kept it kept it free and open</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:45.149" style="s2">you know it wasn&#39;t like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.169" end="00:08:48.269" style="s2">follow my theory but that is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.149" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">implication as well which is a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.269" end="00:08:54.990" style="s2">thing and you know so I I did two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.990" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">the discourse and help develop a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:02.460" style="s2">formal theory of what Madame modernism</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:04.680" style="s2">is and my is my side view article is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.460" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">kind of the latest installment or</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.680" end="00:09:10.290" style="s2">culmination of that synthesis you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">thanks because I have a spreadsheet of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.290" end="00:09:14.370" style="s2">light 270 sources now and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">there&#39;s more sources coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.370" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">course but it&#39;s hard to keep keep track</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:21.750" style="s2">of but that was a you know aggregate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:23.220" style="s2">discourse so everyone can see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:25.010" style="s2">being said everywhere you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.220" end="00:09:27.840" style="s2">that&#39;s just an important research</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.010" end="00:09:29.880" style="s2">function that you know other think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.840" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">or scholars were doing but then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.880" end="00:09:34.830" style="s2">other thing was you know developing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">implicitly through my own work so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.830" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">know I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got the film mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">and then all which is about abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">and then all my research about</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:48.450" style="s2">abstraction and then the kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:51.060" style="s2">adjacent research interests that I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.450" end="00:09:53.400" style="s2">like evolutionary globalization and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.060" end="00:09:56.130" style="s2">systemic conspiracy which are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.400" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">two sides of the same coin and what each</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.130" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">of those do is kind of like looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:04.740" style="s2">the latest wave of scholarship on those</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:08.280" style="s2">topics and it&#39;s very synthetic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.740" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">syncretic tries to integrate them so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.280" end="00:10:13.340" style="s2">try to develop a kind of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:16.080" style="s2">sociology implicitly through those and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.340" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some other fields I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.080" end="00:10:21.870" style="s2">in that I&#39;ve that are less developed but</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">abstraction and meta modernism are also</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.870" end="00:10:26.490" style="s2">- I&#39;ve written about quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:31.500" style="s2">whether it&#39;s kind of a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.490" end="00:10:34.350" style="s2">commentary or you know art commentary or</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:37.800" style="s2">the the more the more high theory stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.350" end="00:10:41.520" style="s2">so lately that has really crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.800" end="00:10:43.610" style="s2">into a convergence theory into my hopes</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.520" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">and intentions for consensus building</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.610" end="00:10:49.290" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been really on about for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:51.480" style="s2">long time but finally wrote about and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.290" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">then most recently anti-intellectualism</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.480" end="00:10:57.060" style="s2">which which ties a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:58.620" style="s2">together because there&#39;s as the this</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.060" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">think-tank book that I referenced and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.620" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">has many other sources suggests there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">a kind of subtle anti-intellectualism</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:07.950" style="s2">that takes place between us between</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:08.760" style="s2">intellectuals and so you know we you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.950" end="00:11:10.770" style="s2">know just</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.760" end="00:11:13.590" style="s2">we commit all sorts of fallacies even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.770" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of them but perhaps one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.590" end="00:11:20.760" style="s2">the ones that stuck out to me the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:24.360" style="s2">is the Steve fuller this a scholar of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.760" end="00:11:27.240" style="s2">social epistemology describing mmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.360" end="00:11:29.730" style="s2">heuristics as anti intellectual you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.240" end="00:11:31.350" style="s2">the availability bias in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.730" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">anti intellectual and that really that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:36.150" style="s2">really struck me because that&#39;s along</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:38.460" style="s2">the lines of you know my critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.150" end="00:11:40.650" style="s2">integral people like Ken Wilber people</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.460" end="00:11:43.500" style="s2">of course like Jordan Hall who talk in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.650" end="00:11:45.210" style="s2">lot of these kind of neologisms or</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.500" end="00:11:47.130" style="s2">simplicity&#39;s and things like the blue</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.210" end="00:11:48.990" style="s2">church and read religion which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.130" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">criticized for just being lifted from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.990" end="00:11:54.270" style="s2">trump thread that these are you know so</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.730" style="s2">when you think in those terms you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.270" end="00:11:59.430" style="s2">collapsing into the availability bias</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.730" end="00:12:02.750" style="s2">and and and you&#39;re using somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.430" end="00:12:06.180" style="s2">words to do your thinking for you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.750" end="00:12:09.330" style="s2">and so Steve fuller identifies that as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.180" end="00:12:11.160" style="s2">kind of anti intellectual bias and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.330" end="00:12:13.220" style="s2">think getting into the subtlety of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.160" end="00:12:15.570" style="s2">has been really interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.220" end="00:12:17.820" style="s2">because you know there&#39;s so much to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.570" end="00:12:20.610" style="s2">unpack about what the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.820" end="00:12:24.390" style="s2">tradition actually is what the radical</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.610" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">tradition is because you know we we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.390" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">tend to forget historically some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:31.230" style="s2">more important thinkers or political</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:35.250" style="s2">actors right they get whitewashed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.230" end="00:12:37.170" style="s2">and erased and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.250" end="00:12:39.720" style="s2">statues of all these Confederate it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:40.830" style="s2">you know heroes or whatever and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.720" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">they&#39;re being they&#39;re being torn down</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.830" end="00:12:45.570" style="s2">that now and that&#39;s not to erase history</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.660" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">that&#39;s actually to remember history</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.570" end="00:12:51.540" style="s2">properly right it&#39;s kind of historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:51.900" style="s2">revisionism so so there was a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.540" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.900" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">Brent yeah pick up a couple threads so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:13:00.690" style="s2">one thread that I thought because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:02.970" style="s2">still sort of one I want to probe you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:05.010" style="s2">more about their modernism brand right</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.970" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">you need to come up what seem to come up</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:08.430" style="s2">as towards the end is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:10.410" style="s2">work in which is I think why you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.430" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">mentioned it I do work on you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.410" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">rationality and things like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:15.180" style="s2">availability heuristic and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">relationship between heuristic and bias</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.180" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">and rationality and and then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:22.620" style="s2">lot in your there also at least I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:25.290" style="s2">directly implied that implicit</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.620" end="00:13:27.720" style="s2">that sense about you know the importance</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.290" end="00:13:28.950" style="s2">of dealing with self-deception whether</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.720" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">or not it&#39;s individual or collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.950" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">yeah those are things I talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:35.340" style="s2">them something I&#39;m very interested in so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:38.070" style="s2">one of the ways I&#39;ve heard people talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.340" end="00:13:39.660" style="s2">about these three categories and I grant</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.070" end="00:13:41.730" style="s2">you they&#39;re there they&#39;re on a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.660" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">and they&#39;re slippery but we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.730" end="00:13:46.770" style="s2">we need to have some points of reference</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:48.630" style="s2">for our discussion right one way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.770" end="00:13:51.300" style="s2">heard people talk about modernism</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.630" end="00:13:53.700" style="s2">post-modernism and meta modernism and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:54.990" style="s2">had a good discussion on leather wiki</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.700" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">with David Chapman about this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.990" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">especially in their conception of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:02.150" style="s2">rationality the conception of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:04.920" style="s2">rationality is and that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.150" end="00:14:08.490" style="s2">part of what laymen was saying when I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.920" end="00:14:11.100" style="s2">was asking so is that is that a fair way</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.490" end="00:14:13.140" style="s2">of trying to get you know a doorway into</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.100" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">this but thinking about others agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.140" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">conceive of rationality now part of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:22.530" style="s2">point I just if I can just make one more</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:24.630" style="s2">point part part of my critique of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.530" end="00:14:26.390" style="s2">has typically been called modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.630" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">what I think was implied in</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.390" end="00:14:32.790" style="s2">post-modernism us especially in aspects</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:36.390" style="s2">of some aspects of Derrida but we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.790" end="00:14:39.210" style="s2">put that aside for now is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.390" end="00:14:42.180" style="s2">thinking of his his criticism of logos</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.210" end="00:14:44.520" style="s2">centrism for example is that what</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.180" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">modernity had a very truncated and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.520" end="00:14:49.980" style="s2">strangulated notion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:53.370" style="s2">post-modernism basically critiqued that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.980" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">and then what I heard laymen saying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.370" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">me was well and this really saying to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:00.270" style="s2">because this is part of my work right</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:02.190" style="s2">there&#39;s no no we need we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.270" end="00:15:04.350" style="s2">back a more encompassing notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.190" end="00:15:06.750" style="s2">rationality in which ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.350" end="00:15:08.850" style="s2">overcoming self-deception and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.750" end="00:15:10.950" style="s2">recognition of bias in our thought plays</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.850" end="00:15:13.590" style="s2">a much more fundamental role in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.950" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">formal logical consistency and so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.590" end="00:15:18.630" style="s2">has been something that I&#39;ve been I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:20.460" style="s2">offering that as a point of connection</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.630" end="00:15:23.580" style="s2">so that I can better understand between</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.460" end="00:15:27.030" style="s2">my work and and meta modernist is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.580" end="00:15:29.880" style="s2">is that a useful thing to just to to try</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.030" end="00:15:31.980" style="s2">and explore yeah I think so yeah I got</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.880" end="00:15:33.870" style="s2">derailed there with my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.980" end="00:15:36.209" style="s2">meta modernism by the defective part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.870" end="00:15:38.369" style="s2">the story and I think you know the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.209" end="00:15:40.110" style="s2">trans rational comes to mind right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.369" end="00:15:42.119" style="s2">so there&#39;s maybe a kind of progression</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.110" end="00:15:48.420" style="s2">from rational to post rational the trans</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.119" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">rational sure and and yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.420" end="00:15:50.970" style="s2">we don&#39;t we never want to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:53.009" style="s2">reductionist right that&#39;s the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.970" end="00:15:55.170" style="s2">with thinking about these things and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.009" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what I saw in people in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.170" end="00:16:00.389" style="s2">integral community when they would try</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:03.149" style="s2">to you know download meta modernism or</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.389" end="00:16:05.220" style="s2">even integral you know and and again</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.149" end="00:16:07.350" style="s2">with the heuristics to rely on the kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.220" end="00:16:10.439" style="s2">of integral heuristics and this and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.350" end="00:16:12.179" style="s2">stage theories so slow down yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.439" end="00:16:13.319" style="s2">interested in that too because again</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.179" end="00:16:15.779" style="s2">this is something that I&#39;ve only had</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.319" end="00:16:18.360" style="s2">passing on connection with I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.779" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">spoken with Wilbur okay I&#39;ve yet to read</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.360" end="00:16:22.259" style="s2">any of his work in depth I bought his</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.610" end="00:16:24.569" style="s2">book on the recommendation of notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.259" end="00:16:26.009" style="s2">called the religion of tomorrow because</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.569" end="00:16:28.670" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to read books they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.009" end="00:16:31.410" style="s2">to talk about the future of religion so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.670" end="00:16:33.119" style="s2">what can you can you can you slow that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.410" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">down and unpack it a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.119" end="00:16:36.059" style="s2">maybe you know that will also help me</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.470" end="00:16:38.069" style="s2">understand better you know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.059" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">by translational your criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.069" end="00:16:43.850" style="s2">integral like what is them what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:46.259" style="s2">what&#39;s here is it is it a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.850" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">oversimplification that you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.259" end="00:16:52.649" style="s2">your finger on or what is it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:54.660" style="s2">expand on that um yeah I I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.649" end="00:16:57.029" style="s2">to mention the term I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.660" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">how deep I can go into it just off off</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">the top of my head because I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:07.350" style="s2">just want to I want I want I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:09.929" style="s2">an example where I can see you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:11.209" style="s2">thinking like doing it&#39;s critical work</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.929" end="00:17:14.459" style="s2">and that was something that I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.209" end="00:17:17.789" style="s2">rationality and then I have like I said</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.459" end="00:17:20.399" style="s2">I&#39;m not invested in integral I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.789" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">to understand it I know layman has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.399" end="00:17:25.110" style="s2">history with it and he&#39;s had you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.850" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get a sense there so I try</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.110" end="00:17:28.919" style="s2">to find a point of contact for us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.850" end="00:17:31.020" style="s2">and and I don&#39;t want to be too</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.919" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">reductionist stew with integral because</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.020" end="00:17:36.840" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of non Wilbur forms there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:38.340" style="s2">people have criticized Wilbur so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.840" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">of this has taken place within that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.340" end="00:17:43.500" style="s2">community before and that&#39;s part of for</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:45.870" style="s2">me the the ironic frustration and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.500" end="00:17:49.559" style="s2">obscene a tree emerge in its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.870" end="00:17:51.269" style="s2">crude forms because so I wrote about a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">part article about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.269" end="00:17:57.960" style="s2">between integral meta modernism and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:17:59.970" style="s2">intellectual dark web oh that&#39;s great we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.960" end="00:18:01.889" style="s2">can is that close enough in your memory</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.970" end="00:18:04.669" style="s2">could up we could unpack that a bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.889" end="00:18:07.139" style="s2">yeah I can try because it emerged</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.669" end="00:18:08.730" style="s2">basically you know because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.139" end="00:18:10.769" style="s2">many integral people in Hans E&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.730" end="00:18:13.470" style="s2">community and they would say like</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.769" end="00:18:14.759" style="s2">integral /mm like they&#39;re the meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.470" end="00:18:17.009" style="s2">martyrs and like they&#39;re the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.759" end="00:18:18.809" style="s2">same thing and I was I had to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.009" end="00:18:21.179" style="s2">of work to kind of try to disentangle</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.809" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">that for people because I the same well</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.179" end="00:18:23.549" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s formula and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.980" style="s2">and an actor and they don&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.549" end="00:18:29.549" style="s2">integral at all like it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.980" end="00:18:31.470" style="s2">tradition right and so just people tend</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.549" end="00:18:33.809" style="s2">to get hung up on that integral term</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.470" end="00:18:35.279" style="s2">because there&#39;s a community there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.809" end="00:18:39.029" style="s2">lot of books they&#39;ve invested so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.279" end="00:18:41.549" style="s2">energy into it and and maybe just to tie</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.029" end="00:18:43.409" style="s2">that off what we can we can go into it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.549" end="00:18:46.230" style="s2">but but the thing that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.409" end="00:18:48.419" style="s2">first is in those articles I reference a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.230" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">book from 2015 which is Eckstein is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.419" end="00:18:53.850" style="s2">involved in actually yeah called meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">theory for the 21st century right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.850" end="00:18:57.509" style="s2">the whole point in that book there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">table I take from the book it basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.509" end="00:19:03.419" style="s2">tries to triangulate and synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:06.600" style="s2">three major paradigms which is integral</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.419" end="00:19:08.999" style="s2">theory critical realism and complex</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.600" end="00:19:10.980" style="s2">thought and and the table kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.999" end="00:19:12.899" style="s2">juxtapose them so so that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.980" end="00:19:16.230" style="s2">right there that you can&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.899" end="00:19:17.999" style="s2">integral theory these other things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.230" end="00:19:19.799" style="s2">are well developed and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.999" end="00:19:22.230" style="s2">interesting because the general critique</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.799" end="00:19:23.669" style="s2">of integral the takeaway is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.230" end="00:19:25.950" style="s2">kind of negligent of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.669" end="00:19:27.960" style="s2">right it&#39;s like progressive and in name</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.950" end="00:19:31.409" style="s2">but a little bit like conscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.960" end="00:19:34.200" style="s2">capitalism instead and so that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.409" end="00:19:37.909" style="s2">of divide in our thinking exists today</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.200" end="00:19:42.779" style="s2">you know people lack the language to to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.909" end="00:19:43.559" style="s2">you know D complexify capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.779" end="00:19:45.690" style="s2">socialism</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.559" end="00:19:49.649" style="s2">you know actually make these things</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.690" end="00:19:51.869" style="s2">operational so the way the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.649" end="00:19:53.580" style="s2">darkweb fits into that is you know at</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.869" end="00:19:56.429" style="s2">that point ken wilber had put out some</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.580" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">videos like that were kind of his</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.429" end="00:20:02.119" style="s2">commentary on the on the IDW and it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:02.119" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:11.560" style="s2">yeah Wilbur had Wilbur had a like a six</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.660" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">part series you know and and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.560" end="00:20:17.500" style="s2">at that point other integral people like</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">the names Mark Forman and Rob Smith come</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.500" end="00:20:22.330" style="s2">to mind and I&#39;m Corey DeVos to some</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.520" style="s2">extent like they&#39;d already been critical</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:27.460" style="s2">of the IDW and there wasn&#39;t even that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.520" end="00:20:29.290" style="s2">kind of collective thinking that it had</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.460" end="00:20:31.660" style="s2">like trickled up to Wilbur so I found</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.290" end="00:20:33.730" style="s2">his position just really really weak</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.660" end="00:20:35.920" style="s2">really diluted like oh yeah all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.730" end="00:20:38.620" style="s2">thinkers are second tier like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.920" end="00:20:41.560" style="s2">just so irresponsible and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.620" end="00:20:47.380" style="s2">incoherent I think because this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.560" end="00:20:49.000" style="s2">kind of metaphorical system so so</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.380" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">there&#39;s all those intersections you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.000" end="00:20:54.010" style="s2">and then like Eric Weinstein and tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.020" style="s2">out like oh what Ken Wilber knows who I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.010" end="00:20:58.030" style="s2">am and that&#39;s interesting but you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.020" end="00:21:01.270" style="s2">Weinstein wasn&#39;t necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.030" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">endorsing integral or anything and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.270" end="00:21:05.140" style="s2">know rebel wisdom like a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:07.570" style="s2">their their branding for awhile I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.140" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">like who is the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.570" end="00:21:12.550" style="s2">integral like is Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:15.430" style="s2">integral I did think it was totally the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.550" end="00:21:19.050" style="s2">wrong question you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.430" end="00:21:22.060" style="s2">so in what wait so you you took time to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.050" end="00:21:24.100" style="s2">like to pull apart I mean it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.060" end="00:21:25.900" style="s2">it was a bit of a challenge pull apart</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.100" end="00:21:27.670" style="s2">meta modernism from integral because</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.900" end="00:21:29.890" style="s2">people were just treating them as</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.670" end="00:21:33.580" style="s2">synonyms and you thought that was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.890" end="00:21:37.660" style="s2">of deep conceptual mistake one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.580" end="00:21:39.790" style="s2">things that again I&#39;m very hesitant like</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.660" end="00:21:42.220" style="s2">I said I&#39;m pronouncing and announcing</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.790" end="00:21:45.000" style="s2">I&#39;m ignorant of a integral I only know</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.220" end="00:21:47.680" style="s2">of it I&#39;ve read so secondary stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.000" end="00:21:49.450" style="s2">please take that into account but and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.680" end="00:21:55.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve met people who&#39;ve talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.450" end="00:21:59.500" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see the concern with</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.860" end="00:22:02.380" style="s2">self-deception and rationality and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.500" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">that relates to your critique about not</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.380" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2">addressing issues of social justice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">oh sorry if I if I can clarify that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">point quickly oh because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:21.190" style="s2">what I wanted to add was like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:24.070" style="s2">there is sort of integral left tradition</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.190" end="00:22:27.040" style="s2">if you will and also kind of activity</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.070" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">now right and you know exact size Equus</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.040" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2">involved sure with that book and arguing</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:35.800" style="s2">on the social justice side in debates</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:39.100" style="s2">and so you know I sort of work with</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.800" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">Jeremy Johnson a little bit and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.100" end="00:22:43.270" style="s2">like a left activist an integral thinker</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:44.680" style="s2">and he draws from a different from</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.270" end="00:22:47.620" style="s2">different sources but I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.680" end="00:22:49.570" style="s2">some compatibility just to a brief</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.620" end="00:22:52.780" style="s2">overview of integral I guess it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.570" end="00:22:54.580" style="s2">long term kind of you know synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.780" end="00:22:57.970" style="s2">thinking right so you have like mystics</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.580" end="00:23:01.930" style="s2">involved right and then you and um you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.970" end="00:23:04.180" style="s2">know like someone I promote a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.930" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">Michael Brooks who also has an integral</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.180" end="00:23:08.290" style="s2">background right but he but he shares my</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">critiques and that he kind of grew out</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.290" end="00:23:13.870" style="s2">of the Ken Wilber version of integral</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:16.830" style="s2">and we so all of us now we try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.870" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">it back to politics and make it grounded</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.830" end="00:23:22.030" style="s2">yes I just wanted to add that qualifier</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">well no - fair enough and I do want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.030" end="00:23:27.430" style="s2">be fair I mean you&#39;d probably know from</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:29.410" style="s2">my work that I try to get as much credit</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.430" end="00:23:32.920" style="s2">and recognition as possible the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.410" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">work and you know I know Zac and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.920" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">really appreciate his work I just got a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:37.990" style="s2">book today by the way an education</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:39.580" style="s2">between two worlds but there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.990" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">something that came up so see my</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.580" end="00:23:44.740" style="s2">connection to integral is I know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:46.630" style="s2">through transpersonal psychology and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.740" end="00:23:50.050" style="s2">know right know forgave Ferrara&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.630" end="00:23:52.840" style="s2">critique of standard transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.050" end="00:23:55.660" style="s2">psychology as being tied to a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.840" end="00:23:58.810" style="s2">astride of epistemology and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.660" end="00:24:01.210" style="s2">not really philosophically or cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.810" end="00:24:02.800" style="s2">scientifically up-to-date in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.210" end="00:24:06.190" style="s2">its epistemology and its thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.800" end="00:24:08.310" style="s2">cognition and meaning-making and I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.190" end="00:24:10.810" style="s2">to meet forever I never have</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.310" end="00:24:13.480" style="s2">but he was one of the influences on my</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.810" end="00:24:17.790" style="s2">idea participatory knowing because he</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.480" end="00:24:20.050" style="s2">argues that a much more participatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.790" end="00:24:24.100" style="s2">epistemology is needed than the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.050" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">that&#39;s presupposed by standard</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.100" end="00:24:29.140" style="s2">especially Wilbur&#39;s form purely</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:29.980" style="s2">structural kind of well seems fairly</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.140" end="00:24:34.809" style="s2">structural kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.980" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">of transpersonal psychology so I get</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.809" end="00:24:41.140" style="s2">that and and that&#39;s how the mystic is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:42.870" style="s2">supposed to be taken in but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.140" end="00:24:47.770" style="s2">me that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.870" end="00:24:51.010" style="s2">post-modernism does is wake people up to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.770" end="00:24:52.840" style="s2">implicit epistemologies and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.010" end="00:24:56.040" style="s2">stand back and take a more critical eye</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.840" end="00:24:58.900" style="s2">on them and this is a kind of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.040" end="00:25:03.070" style="s2">addressing of self-deception that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.900" end="00:25:08.230" style="s2">and I think we&#39;ll share and so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.070" end="00:25:10.750" style="s2">to me therefore that because is it fair</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.230" end="00:25:12.490" style="s2">to say that one of the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.750" end="00:25:14.710" style="s2">between so it&#39;s a question what a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.490" end="00:25:16.419" style="s2">statement is it is it that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.710" end="00:25:20.200" style="s2">distinction between meta modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.419" end="00:25:22.330" style="s2">integral and the IDW is that meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.200" end="00:25:24.820" style="s2">modernism takes post-modernism very</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.330" end="00:25:26.830" style="s2">seriously and says that there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.820" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">good work and good argumentation there</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.830" end="00:25:33.460" style="s2">the IDW one of my critiques of it and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:36.309" style="s2">think that&#39;s explicit is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.460" end="00:25:38.620" style="s2">think it has the reliance for example on</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.309" end="00:25:42.580" style="s2">Hicks&#39;s presentation a birthmark</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.620" end="00:25:45.400" style="s2">I think you know just it&#39;s just bad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.580" end="00:25:51.549" style="s2">just bad bad philosophy bad work right</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.400" end="00:25:55.410" style="s2">and so I think the IDW did not take</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.549" end="00:25:57.400" style="s2">post-modernism seriously yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.410" end="00:26:00.040" style="s2">intellectually it took it seriously in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.400" end="00:26:02.140" style="s2">terms of an emotional reaction to it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.040" end="00:26:04.570" style="s2">not intellectually now it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.140" end="00:26:06.250" style="s2">so this is more again very much more</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:09.850" style="s2">hesitant but it&#39;s not to me like</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.250" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">integral also isn&#39;t properly reading or</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.850" end="00:26:15.730" style="s2">understand being if if Ferreras critique</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:17.890" style="s2">is good and it seems to be good that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.730" end="00:26:21.309" style="s2">suggests to me it implies to me that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.890" end="00:26:24.070" style="s2">integral did not take the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.309" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">revelation of implicit epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.070" end="00:26:27.400" style="s2">and the critique of it that integral</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:31.179" style="s2">hasn&#39;t also has not taken that seriously</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.400" end="00:26:35.500" style="s2">enough in general at least that the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.179" end="00:26:36.760" style="s2">vil the Wilber version would you what do</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.500" end="00:26:39.429" style="s2">you think of that am I making oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.760" end="00:26:41.860" style="s2">mean no no I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.429" end="00:26:42.690" style="s2">absolutely on point that&#39;s that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.860" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">of a point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.690" end="00:26:48.210" style="s2">in my in my IDW critiques and it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:50.670" style="s2">and yeah especially if you&#39;re drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.210" end="00:26:52.800" style="s2">meta modernism it seems very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.670" end="00:26:55.590" style="s2">like how do people not realize this but</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.800" end="00:26:57.930" style="s2">but for 30 years there&#39;s been a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.590" end="00:26:59.850" style="s2">culture war over post-modernism right</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.930" end="00:27:03.510" style="s2">like a lot of this is rehashed stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.850" end="00:27:05.460" style="s2">from the 90s because the you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.510" end="00:27:07.350" style="s2">know we don&#39;t it&#39;s a kind of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.460" end="00:27:09.150" style="s2">thing we don&#39;t need to point fingers too</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.350" end="00:27:12.360" style="s2">much but it&#39;s like the you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.150" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">post-modernism in the 90s was was waning</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.360" end="00:27:20.430" style="s2">and declining and there was critiques</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:22.500" style="s2">and and it you know it like first of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.430" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">it&#39;s irreducible right that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.500" end="00:27:26.850" style="s2">I&#39;m making my side view so so aside the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.870" end="00:27:29.400" style="s2">article so there&#39;s more than just</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.850" end="00:27:32.010" style="s2">strengths there like it&#39;s a whole era</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.400" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole you know multiple</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.010" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">discourses but but that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">fractionation and fragmenting you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:45.270" style="s2">is part of the problem with our ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:48.060" style="s2">expanding a culture right it&#39;s just a an</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.270" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">increasingly relativist right so so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.060" end="00:27:52.410" style="s2">think people noticed and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.870" style="s2">2000s you have these other discourses</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.410" end="00:27:58.710" style="s2">like post post-modernism right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.870" end="00:28:00.210" style="s2">actually a term which is funny it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.710" end="00:28:02.400" style="s2">well what is that the best you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.210" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">come up with why don&#39;t we just jump to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.400" end="00:28:07.380" style="s2">meta modernism right but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.660" style="s2">another thing with my research is I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.380" end="00:28:12.510" style="s2">actually found sources on meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.660" end="00:28:14.340" style="s2">from the 90s that you know they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.510" end="00:28:17.940" style="s2">good sources but they&#39;re not huge</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.340" end="00:28:19.920" style="s2">they&#39;re not like mmm they&#39;re very strong</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.940" end="00:28:22.260" style="s2">arguments but they&#39;re not well developed</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.920" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">beyond that and so it&#39;s sort of a missed</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.260" end="00:28:25.680" style="s2">opportunity and then there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:27.630" style="s2">other discourses hyper modernism trans</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.680" end="00:28:31.110" style="s2">Mormon ISM so I&#39;m interested in all</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.630" end="00:28:34.110" style="s2">these things but meta modernism has the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.110" end="00:28:36.540" style="s2">most generative potential and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.110" end="00:28:38.730" style="s2">communities around them right so that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.540" end="00:28:44.600" style="s2">that is really the the the main the main</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.730" end="00:28:47.040" style="s2">attractor and so so I tried to map out</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.600" end="00:28:49.920" style="s2">as much of that as I could in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.040" end="00:28:52.170" style="s2">side-view article and but just to to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.920" end="00:28:54.300" style="s2">bring it home like your your point is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.170" end="00:28:56.490" style="s2">absolutely correct they just didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.300" end="00:28:59.820" style="s2">the IDW dismisses and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.490" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">post-modernism wholesale and integral</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">did go through a phase where they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">critical of it you know and Wilbur calls</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:10.110" style="s2">it the mean green mean green mean and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.269" style="s2">you know it was processed in a way but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.110" end="00:29:14.999" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.269" end="00:29:17.369" style="s2">healthy it wasn&#39;t conclusive because</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.999" end="00:29:21.419" style="s2">there&#39;s just so much there and so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.369" end="00:29:23.789" style="s2">know it&#39;s really a mental feat - to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.419" end="00:29:26.249" style="s2">whether implicitly or explicitly try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.789" end="00:29:28.740" style="s2">try to be synthesizing the modern ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.249" end="00:29:30.990" style="s2">and postmodern ideas yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:33.419" style="s2">you do it a bit in your in your side you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.990" end="00:29:35.850" style="s2">article like like your side view article</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.419" end="00:29:39.299" style="s2">is an incredibly dense incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.850" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">incredibly wordy and to do in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.299" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">is some words I actually had to look up</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.759" end="00:29:50.700" style="s2">which which I have no problem admitting</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.519" end="00:29:53.549" style="s2">but it&#39;s a but it&#39;s also not that common</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.700" end="00:29:55.980" style="s2">you know I like to know my words but but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.549" end="00:29:58.549" style="s2">but it&#39;s incredibly dense neck in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.980" end="00:30:02.700" style="s2">capacity which is great because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.549" end="00:30:04.879" style="s2">you know uh just just a compression of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.700" end="00:30:07.559" style="s2">the argument that you&#39;re making right</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.879" end="00:30:09.210" style="s2">and I there&#39;s some definitely cement</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.559" end="00:30:11.429" style="s2">modern qualities like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.210" end="00:30:15.029" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re doing a very syncretic</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.429" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">things right and yeah consolidating a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.029" end="00:30:18.539" style="s2">lot of ideas into these into these</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:20.999" style="s2">concepts like and then you list them out</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.539" end="00:30:29.490" style="s2">like new and hasta sysm pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.999" end="00:30:32.070" style="s2">ideologies ersatz mythologies yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.490" end="00:30:34.259" style="s2">want to pick up on this then because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.070" end="00:30:37.740" style="s2">think I this feels like it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.259" end="00:30:39.960" style="s2">getting legs what we&#39;re doing here first</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.740" end="00:30:41.100" style="s2">of all I mean I agree with you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.960" end="00:30:42.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned it a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.100" end="00:30:47.070" style="s2">and I just want to pause and expand it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:49.110" style="s2">for people it&#39;s it&#39;s actually I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:50.340" style="s2">know conversation has to take place at</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.110" end="00:30:51.480" style="s2">different levels and that&#39;s fine and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.340" end="00:30:53.519" style="s2">that&#39;s there and that&#39;s part of how it</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.480" end="00:30:55.850" style="s2">functions but you shouldn&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.519" end="00:31:00.119" style="s2">post-modernism as if it&#39;s a homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.850" end="00:31:02.190" style="s2">single thing like so I can&#39;t claim to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.119" end="00:31:04.590" style="s2">have read all of these thinkers I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.190" end="00:31:08.490" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;ve I&#39;ve read three I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.590" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">Derrida deeply studied in Foucault not</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.490" end="00:31:13.510" style="s2">as deeply but I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">and then warty right and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.510" end="00:31:17.050" style="s2">even their backgrounds are very</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:19.300" style="s2">different you know Dario is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.050" end="00:31:21.820" style="s2">dependent on SACEUR in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.300" end="00:31:24.700" style="s2">Foucault is not an R or D comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.820" end="00:31:27.670" style="s2">you know pragmatism he&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.700" end="00:31:29.260" style="s2">influenced you know by James and Peirce</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.670" end="00:31:34.540" style="s2">and Dewey right</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.260" end="00:31:37.210" style="s2">and so like trying to put that all</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.540" end="00:31:39.280" style="s2">together as it&#39;s as a single thing I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.210" end="00:31:43.030" style="s2">recommend instead this strategy</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.280" end="00:31:45.310" style="s2">mom I&#39;m recommend that what we should do</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.030" end="00:31:46.600" style="s2">because these people I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.310" end="00:31:48.550" style="s2">mistake to say they should be immune</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.600" end="00:31:50.770" style="s2">from criticism I dislike that also I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.550" end="00:31:53.740" style="s2">also dislike the deification of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.770" end="00:31:55.630" style="s2">post-modernism as if no I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.740" end="00:31:58.330" style="s2">example I think Han in his book the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.630" end="00:32:00.700" style="s2">agony of eros has a powerful critique of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.330" end="00:32:02.950" style="s2">Foucault that people should read right</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.700" end="00:32:05.050" style="s2">but what I&#39;m saying is you should look</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.950" end="00:32:06.250" style="s2">at individual arguments by individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.050" end="00:32:08.530" style="s2">thinkers and respond to them with</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.250" end="00:32:11.710" style="s2">individual counter arguments or counter</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.530" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">proposals rather than a pastiche and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.710" end="00:32:14.740" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very danger maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:16.270" style="s2">what you&#39;re meaning from when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.740" end="00:32:17.830" style="s2">talking about sort of giving in to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.270" end="00:32:19.930" style="s2">availability heuristic and an</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.830" end="00:32:23.260" style="s2">oversimplification strategy so for</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.930" end="00:32:24.580" style="s2">example I think very does not like I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.260" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">make this argument extensively and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.580" end="00:32:28.210" style="s2">have made it elsewhere so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">gesturing it and so not I&#39;m not asking</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">for your agreement I&#39;m just giving an</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">example right but I think Derrida&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:36.670" style="s2">notion of difference can be compared</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:37.960" style="s2">very insightful II to this notion I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.670" end="00:32:40.690" style="s2">been working at from cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.960" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">of relevance realization and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.690" end="00:32:45.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of deep similarities there</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:47.010" style="s2">and even his take on it having kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.910" end="00:32:49.240" style="s2">Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.010" end="00:32:51.370" style="s2">religious significance his connections</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.240" end="00:32:55.990" style="s2">with negative theology are there to read</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.370" end="00:32:58.390" style="s2">right and so but that also gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.990" end="00:33:00.970" style="s2">way of saying by because I can connect</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.390" end="00:33:01.660" style="s2">it to Cox I I can bring aspects in to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.970" end="00:33:05.410" style="s2">differ ons</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.660" end="00:33:07.180" style="s2">that perhaps Derrida is overlooking you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.410" end="00:33:09.610" style="s2">know the whole stuff about embodied</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.180" end="00:33:12.310" style="s2">extended embedded cognition isn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.610" end="00:33:14.140" style="s2">developed in in Derrida and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.310" end="00:33:16.030" style="s2">and this is something I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.140" end="00:33:18.400" style="s2">to promote a general if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.030" end="00:33:20.170" style="s2">specific argument and then have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.400" end="00:33:22.030" style="s2">specific bridging you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.170" end="00:33:23.270" style="s2">counterproposal to it then you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.030" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">actually enter into</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.270" end="00:33:28.250" style="s2">useful dialogue with the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:31.790" style="s2">and so now sorry this is a long preamble</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.250" end="00:33:33.380" style="s2">but I take that and and feel feel to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.790" end="00:33:35.390" style="s2">correct me but I think that is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.380" end="00:33:37.970" style="s2">example of what I see the meta monitors</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.390" end="00:33:39.890" style="s2">trying to do like I see them entering</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.970" end="00:33:41.960" style="s2">okay they here&#39;s a postmodern thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.890" end="00:33:43.850" style="s2">here&#39;s you know something I can link it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.960" end="00:33:46.910" style="s2">to and then put them into dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.850" end="00:33:49.310" style="s2">see if I can move beyond it but not in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.910" end="00:33:51.560" style="s2">dismissive fashion but in a dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.310" end="00:33:52.910" style="s2">fashion so you&#39;re nodding so maybe I am</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.560" end="00:33:54.860" style="s2">saying something that resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.910" end="00:33:58.250" style="s2">yeah everything you said there makes</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.860" end="00:34:02.870" style="s2">sense and there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.250" end="00:34:05.660" style="s2">things I wanted to anchor into what</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.870" end="00:34:07.610" style="s2">should I go first with mmm I mean as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.660" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">said post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.610" end="00:34:13.399" style="s2">not homogeneous and when you engage the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:15.590" style="s2">text of all these thinkers and or</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.399" end="00:34:18.050" style="s2">debates you know it becomes less clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.590" end="00:34:20.060" style="s2">who is a postmodernist and who&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.050" end="00:34:22.880" style="s2">know this idea of a label of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.060" end="00:34:25.460" style="s2">postmodernist is is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.880" end="00:34:28.520" style="s2">counterproductive to to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.460" end="00:34:30.409" style="s2">however you&#39;ll always come back into</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.520" end="00:34:32.300" style="s2">these kinds of expressions because</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.409" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">within different subfields there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.300" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">kind of trends like you know English</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.669" end="00:34:38.330" style="s2">literature whatever right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:39.770" style="s2">they&#39;re well defined and so you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.330" end="00:34:41.990" style="s2">won&#39;t you don&#39;t know until you actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.770" end="00:34:43.960" style="s2">dive into the literature and that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.990" end="00:34:46.940" style="s2">speaks to something you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.960" end="00:34:49.070" style="s2">that you know some authors you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.940" end="00:34:51.800" style="s2">read right like this is true for all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.070" end="00:34:54.470" style="s2">us and and it made me think of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.800" end="00:34:59.030" style="s2">generational gap too because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.470" end="00:35:02.420" style="s2">think older scholars like have read more</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.030" end="00:35:05.180" style="s2">right then people like me however you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.420" end="00:35:07.010" style="s2">know that would for younger people you</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.180" end="00:35:08.840" style="s2">know you have the internet now and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.010" end="00:35:11.120" style="s2">have access to more sources than ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.840" end="00:35:14.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s more coming out than ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.120" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">every day so there&#39;s no way you can keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.360" end="00:35:20.660" style="s2">up with it you know and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:23.330" style="s2">have to kind of find a way to grok it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.660" end="00:35:25.610" style="s2">without reading it however that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.330" end="00:35:27.800" style="s2">to qualify that statement you do have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.610" end="00:35:31.490" style="s2">read you do have to read as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.800" end="00:35:33.890" style="s2">can you know so there&#39;s a real paradox</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.490" end="00:35:34.790" style="s2">there and so I mean I realized this a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.890" end="00:35:36.440" style="s2">long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.790" end="00:35:36.920" style="s2">that I was never going to catch up but</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.440" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.920" end="00:35:41.450" style="s2">never gonna go for a PhD because PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.730" style="s2">are about specializing actually I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.450" end="00:35:46.270" style="s2">consciously decided I was gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.730" end="00:35:49.220" style="s2">generalist which is a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.270" end="00:35:51.860" style="s2">path and it&#39;s very rare not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.220" end="00:35:55.370" style="s2">people do it and some people try to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.860" end="00:35:57.800" style="s2">both right but you know so part of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.370" end="00:36:00.050" style="s2">is you know I wanted to pick up on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.800" end="00:36:02.330" style="s2">idea just because what you said</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.050" end="00:36:04.490" style="s2">triggered a one thing don&#39;t you sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.330" end="00:36:05.840" style="s2">don&#39;t lose your shirt but I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.490" end="00:36:07.070" style="s2">to point out something that Brent said</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.840" end="00:36:09.170" style="s2">that I want to highlight and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.070" end="00:36:12.020" style="s2">brought it&#39;s bringing out kind of a new</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.170" end="00:36:13.700" style="s2">bias a new form of self-deception which</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.020" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">is and sloman talks about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.700" end="00:36:18.020" style="s2">knowledge illusion people regularly</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:19.610" style="s2">and reliably confuse access the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.020" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">knowledge with the possession of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.610" end="00:36:24.170" style="s2">knowledge so a standard example of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:25.700" style="s2">experimental II is do you do you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.170" end="00:36:27.410" style="s2">how a bicycle works oh yes of course I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.700" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">do well here draw diagram and show me</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.410" end="00:36:30.440" style="s2">how a bicycle works and then people</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:31.970" style="s2">can&#39;t do it now why did I bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.440" end="00:36:34.340" style="s2">to give the point that Brent just made</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.970" end="00:36:36.670" style="s2">about you know access to the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.340" end="00:36:39.410" style="s2">actually magnifies that bias</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.670" end="00:36:40.820" style="s2">tremendously people think because they</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.410" end="00:36:43.190" style="s2">have access to all this information</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.820" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the same thing as it being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.190" end="00:36:47.180" style="s2">possession of I just wanted I just sorry</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.070" style="s2">for interrupting but but I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.180" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">was an important point to fight for</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.070" end="00:36:53.090" style="s2">people that you know we think about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:56.540" style="s2">oh this access is so empowering</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.090" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">well no denying that but you also have</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.540" end="00:37:01.430" style="s2">to understand ways in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:03.260" style="s2">triggering and amplifying powerful forms</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.430" end="00:37:05.350" style="s2">of self-deception so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.260" end="00:37:09.140" style="s2">put that in there bruh yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.350" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s helpful and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.140" end="00:37:13.580" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that&#39;s true for me to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:15.560" style="s2">some extent too because I do get like</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.580" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2">overconfident with with my knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.560" end="00:37:21.290" style="s2">however the the flip side of that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:22.850" style="s2">like like I&#39;m constantly collecting and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.290" end="00:37:24.650" style="s2">downloading more books articles that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.850" end="00:37:27.080" style="s2">can read right but but I&#39;m but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.650" end="00:37:29.180" style="s2">keeping conscious of the library that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.080" end="00:37:31.820" style="s2">I&#39;m building you know and and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.180" end="00:37:34.370" style="s2">me aware of what I would I might know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.820" end="00:37:37.130" style="s2">and what I definitely don&#39;t know so it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.370" end="00:37:41.710" style="s2">keeps me humble at the same time right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.130" end="00:37:44.840" style="s2">good and yeah that&#39;s very good I I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.710" end="00:37:48.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a virtue towards which I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.840" end="00:37:49.970" style="s2">aspire yeah I try to do it by some very</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.470" end="00:37:52.250" style="s2">explicit and repeated</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.970" end="00:37:54.500" style="s2">repeated habits of action because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.250" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important yeah so to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.500" end="00:37:59.630" style="s2">finish the point I was making before</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:38:00.890" style="s2">like you know as a student you know when</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.630" end="00:38:03.410" style="s2">we&#39;re students we&#39;re you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.890" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">we&#39;re all taught to read primary sources</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.410" end="00:38:07.400" style="s2">right like like I need Plato like like</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:10.280" style="s2">you know do you read and you know do the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.400" end="00:38:12.619" style="s2">work and because that is what you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.280" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">to do as a student it&#39;s an exercise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.619" end="00:38:17.990" style="s2">right so I remember back to a class in</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:21.380" style="s2">2008 right and there and it is like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.990" end="00:38:23.690" style="s2">third-year level class in in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.380" end="00:38:25.730" style="s2">political theory and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.690" end="00:38:27.650" style="s2">just all they can do because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.730" end="00:38:29.390" style="s2">teaching students is kind of give you</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.650" end="00:38:31.940" style="s2">the tools and teach you how to work with</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.390" end="00:38:34.430" style="s2">them right and contrary to public</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.940" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2">opinion with what the IDW tells you they</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.430" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">don&#39;t just indoctrinate you know at</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:41.750" style="s2">least where I went to school they teach</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.530" end="00:38:43.790" style="s2">you how to think very critically mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.750" end="00:38:45.290" style="s2">but but you know they would teach you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.790" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">theories and about international</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.290" end="00:38:49.220" style="s2">relations like oh here&#39;s idealism here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.810" style="s2">realism here&#39;s Marxism here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.220" end="00:38:53.450" style="s2">thinkers and then they actually tell you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.810" end="00:38:55.579" style="s2">like oh like they use the phrases like</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.450" end="00:38:58.190" style="s2">the idealist would say well the realist</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.579" end="00:39:02.420" style="s2">would say you know and that&#39;s useful as</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.190" end="00:39:05.060" style="s2">a student but then of course that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.420" end="00:39:06.349" style="s2">kind of a gross simplification of how</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.060" end="00:39:08.510" style="s2">these things work and so you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.349" end="00:39:10.339" style="s2">to ratify those theories too much and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.510" end="00:39:12.109" style="s2">the point I wanted to make before is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.339" end="00:39:15.730" style="s2">like you know by all means like read</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.109" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">read Plato read read Nietzsche whoever</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.730" end="00:39:21.290" style="s2">read jiseok whatever you want but this</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:25.190" style="s2">idea of primary sources like primary</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.290" end="00:39:29.810" style="s2">sources are essential but also they can</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.190" end="00:39:32.119" style="s2">be wrong and so a kind of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.810" end="00:39:34.190" style="s2">move and maybe postmodern a bit too is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.119" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">like you you you you want to value</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.190" end="00:39:38.599" style="s2">secondary sources - so like with apart</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.970" style="s2">take Marx for example right Marx is</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.599" end="00:39:43.790" style="s2">prolific I&#39;ve read some I&#39;ve read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.970" end="00:39:47.510" style="s2">more marks than Peterson has but I also</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.790" end="00:39:49.130" style="s2">really trust certain secondary sources</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.510" end="00:39:51.140" style="s2">right when you&#39;re reading scholars</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.130" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">writing about Marx you have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.140" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">this is I guess a postmodern thing first</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:57.619" style="s2">and foremost but you have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:40:00.260" style="s2">like well who are they what era and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.619" end="00:40:03.010" style="s2">place are they writing in oh no how does</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.260" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">this situate in the lineage in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.010" end="00:40:09.390" style="s2">well kind of evolution of Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">thought right and so it really defies</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.390" end="00:40:15.310" style="s2">simplification and so so going back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.140" style="s2">that point about you know not being able</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.310" end="00:40:18.670" style="s2">to read everything and keep up with it</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.140" end="00:40:20.290" style="s2">all this is and this is where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.670" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">meta modern right and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.290" end="00:40:25.420" style="s2">this idea of Auto critique in in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:27.250" style="s2">anti-intellectualism article which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.420" end="00:40:29.290" style="s2">like a self critique in like a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.250" end="00:40:30.790" style="s2">critique of society the society that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.290" end="00:40:32.770" style="s2">you&#39;re in you know what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.790" end="00:40:35.050" style="s2">with war and imperialism very meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.770" end="00:40:37.510" style="s2">questions and so I apply that to my own</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.050" end="00:40:39.400" style="s2">work like because nobody&#39;s gonna be is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.510" end="00:40:42.730" style="s2">as critical as me you know I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.400" end="00:40:44.920" style="s2">a dissertation advisor anymore well you</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.730" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">know I don&#39;t have an editor so with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.920" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">oh yeah I mean I think sorry for</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:50.590" style="s2">interrupting but I think that&#39;s I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.600" style="s2">to flag this I mean this is what I this</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.590" end="00:40:55.510" style="s2">is what I think is at the core of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.600" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">meta modern notion of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.510" end="00:40:59.740" style="s2">like when when one of my students asked</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:01.690" style="s2">me for like what&#39;s up what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.740" end="00:41:03.430" style="s2">criteria not a definition but what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.690" end="00:41:04.810" style="s2">criterion but you know we&#39;re gonna pick</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.430" end="00:41:06.310" style="s2">up people that are more rational I say</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.810" end="00:41:09.070" style="s2">look for people who are committed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.310" end="00:41:10.660" style="s2">self correction look for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.070" end="00:41:13.720" style="s2">committed to self direction rather than</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.660" end="00:41:16.810" style="s2">uh you know just a formal tightness in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.720" end="00:41:18.820" style="s2">monologue and so I&#39;ve sort of augmented</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.810" end="00:41:20.890" style="s2">to people who are interested in self</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.820" end="00:41:23.590" style="s2">correction and are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.890" end="00:41:25.330" style="s2">genuine good faith dialogue and trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.590" end="00:41:27.490" style="s2">to specify what that means is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.330" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">doing a lot of work on that but I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.490" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">want to apply that because I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:33.100" style="s2">that&#39;s another point that I think really</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:36.250" style="s2">sings for me the fact that I heard you a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.100" end="00:41:38.740" style="s2">couple times in this discourse point two</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.250" end="00:41:41.320" style="s2">areas in which you have been and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.740" end="00:41:43.900" style="s2">continue to be self-corrective I try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.320" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">do the same thing and so you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.900" end="00:41:48.010" style="s2">not claiming any expertise and that or</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:51.310" style="s2">anything like that I&#39;m just marking that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.010" end="00:41:53.740" style="s2">out as exemplification of how this other</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.310" end="00:41:55.420" style="s2">kind of rationality is more properly</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.740" end="00:41:57.550" style="s2">enacted I just wanted to say that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.420" end="00:41:59.530" style="s2">think more important to flag it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.550" end="00:42:01.780" style="s2">great and I like you pausing and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:06.010" style="s2">know reiterating what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.780" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful and so to if I can quickly</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.010" end="00:42:10.180" style="s2">tie back to like meta modernism and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve tracked with the different schools</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.180" end="00:42:13.720" style="s2">of thought you know I like what Hansie</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.070" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">is doing I like what Thomas Bjorkman is</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.720" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">doing oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.480" end="00:42:24.180" style="s2">yeah yeah you know it&#39;s been it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.730" end="00:42:26.190" style="s2">uh it&#39;s taken me a while to get up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.180" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">nerve to talk about these things but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.190" end="00:42:29.940" style="s2">I I like hearing other people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">it when they know what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.940" end="00:42:35.130" style="s2">about and I and you know because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">because I&#39;m immersed in it so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.130" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">been really helpful but what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:40.010" style="s2">trying to do and I&#39;m part of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.220" end="00:42:41.670" style="s2">project right is they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.010" end="00:42:45.300" style="s2">systematizing and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.670" end="00:42:48.120" style="s2">simplifying this kind of paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.300" end="00:42:52.200" style="s2">and then so so in my side-view article</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.120" end="00:42:54.270" style="s2">identify you know the kind of way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.200" end="00:42:56.910" style="s2">cool the gun school yeah they murdered</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.270" end="00:42:58.860" style="s2">first yeah and just to clarify for</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.910" end="00:43:01.740" style="s2">everybody I only call it the Dutch</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.860" end="00:43:03.420" style="s2">school as a joke because primary authors</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.740" end="00:43:04.920" style="s2">are from the Netherlands and they you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.420" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">know they worked in London they work</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.920" end="00:43:08.580" style="s2">with an international community of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.760" style="s2">scholars and it&#39;s and it&#39;s just a joke</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.580" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">and as I say in my review of their book</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.760" end="00:43:15.690" style="s2">which is a great book I say their their</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:19.020" style="s2">theory fits the social sciences like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.690" end="00:43:22.200" style="s2">pair of clogs which is to say like kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.020" end="00:43:24.300" style="s2">of awkwardly and you know wouldn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.200" end="00:43:26.580" style="s2">it&#39;s got a ton of potential right and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.300" end="00:43:29.100" style="s2">so when you read Vermeulen and Bandar</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.580" end="00:43:32.010" style="s2">knackers book they&#39;re referencing you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.100" end="00:43:34.440" style="s2">know Frederick James and Raymond</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.010" end="00:43:36.810" style="s2">Williams and those are really important</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.440" end="00:43:39.570" style="s2">sources for the background of all this</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.810" end="00:43:41.370" style="s2">stuff right and I and going back to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.570" end="00:43:43.710" style="s2">we&#39;re saying about about reading like</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.370" end="00:43:44.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve skimmed those books you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.710" end="00:43:48.330" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.790" end="00:43:49.890" style="s2">impression and I&#39;ve read you know this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.330" end="00:43:52.680" style="s2">is the thing with second with secondary</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.890" end="00:43:54.390" style="s2">sources so I trust them I trust their</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.680" end="00:43:57.000" style="s2">reading but it&#39;s a kind of tentative</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.390" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">trust yeah because I&#39;m also critical of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.000" end="00:44:02.580" style="s2">Rimula and Van Dekker for what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:03.780" style="s2">identify is what they miss right so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.580" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">know a lot of my work wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.780" end="00:44:08.130" style="s2">possible without them but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to recursively and auto</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.130" end="00:44:15.050" style="s2">critically feedback into that system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:18.180" style="s2">so so that&#39;s sort of where are the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.050" end="00:44:20.280" style="s2">contemporary use is popularized in kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.180" end="00:44:23.490" style="s2">of you know describing trends in art and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.280" end="00:44:26.460" style="s2">culture and and then and then Hansie</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.490" end="00:44:28.440" style="s2">makes a makes a formal move and does</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.460" end="00:44:30.060" style="s2">exactly the same thing I&#39;m advocating is</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.440" end="00:44:34.230" style="s2">saying well we need a medic</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.060" end="00:44:36.840" style="s2">turn in sociology and politics and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.230" end="00:44:38.340" style="s2">and they do that see part of the second</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.840" end="00:44:39.840" style="s2">because you said there&#39;s two groups for</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.340" end="00:44:41.910" style="s2">Mehta modernism where&#39;s he still I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.840" end="00:44:44.490" style="s2">just trying to keep the taxonomy clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.910" end="00:44:46.590" style="s2">yeah so the easy part of a Dutch group</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.490" end="00:44:48.360" style="s2">or is he part of the other group the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.590" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">other so I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.360" end="00:44:53.460" style="s2">Hansie and Hansie is what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">Nordic school ah right because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.460" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">based in in Scandinavia but the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">fictional author Hans he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:01.650" style="s2">based in Switzerland but but the Swiss</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.510" style="s2">school just didn&#39;t sound right because</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.650" end="00:45:06.090" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m trying to talk about reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.510" end="00:45:08.940" style="s2">here too so Thomas Bjorkman wants to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.090" end="00:45:10.860" style="s2">kind of separate himself from that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.940" end="00:45:13.410" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.860" end="00:45:15.450" style="s2">same sphere but I&#39;m in my article I make</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.410" end="00:45:17.360" style="s2">a distinction I say the Nordic school is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.450" end="00:45:19.800" style="s2">just Hansie because they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.360" end="00:45:22.620" style="s2">formalizing it and trying to build a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.800" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">community and it&#39;s just a very I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.620" end="00:45:30.110" style="s2">coach cogent and powerful system and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:33.090" style="s2">you know that doing that it allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.110" end="00:45:34.740" style="s2">distance myself from it and have a meta</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.090" end="00:45:37.170" style="s2">perspective of the two schools and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.740" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2">interplay and as I said to you at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.170" end="00:45:42.360" style="s2">beginning like I&#39;ve been developing my</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:44.610" style="s2">alternative view the whole time but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.360" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">comes into clearer focus as time goes on</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.610" end="00:45:49.560" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s just say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:51.690" style="s2">abstract school because I I point to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.560" end="00:45:53.790" style="s2">thinkers like Benjamin Bratton who</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.690" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">invoke a ton of abstraction in their</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.790" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">work explicitly and I and I track</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:00.030" style="s2">abstraction everywhere it goes right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.410" end="00:46:03.870" style="s2">Daniel smocked and Berger uses it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.030" end="00:46:04.860" style="s2">Jordan Peterson uses it a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.870" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some real value</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.860" end="00:46:09.390" style="s2">there you know my first article about</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:12.360" style="s2">Peterson was was sort of positive in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.390" end="00:46:14.780" style="s2">this regard but that of course I have</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.360" end="00:46:17.370" style="s2">way more criticism for him than</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.780" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">compliments but so you know this all</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.370" end="00:46:21.750" style="s2">this alternative is like I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">trying to highlight some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.750" end="00:46:27.000" style="s2">the other schools and put in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:29.070" style="s2">background right so I have a missing</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.070" end="00:46:35.580" style="s2">novel philosophy of technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.310" end="00:46:38.010" style="s2">liberation theology mmm-hmm and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.580" end="00:46:41.100" style="s2">black black mana modernism right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.010" end="00:46:44.609" style="s2">that&#39;s actual focus on the the subaltern</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.100" end="00:46:47.339" style="s2">the global South alter-globalization</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.609" end="00:46:49.650" style="s2">Black Studies and of course I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.339" end="00:46:51.530" style="s2">that&#39;s all very relevant more than ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.650" end="00:46:55.710" style="s2">with all that&#39;s happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.530" end="00:46:59.460" style="s2">so I just want two questions keep in</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.710" end="00:47:02.490" style="s2">mind what you&#39;re saying that so one is</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.460" end="00:47:04.559" style="s2">just a because I&#39;m ignorant so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.490" end="00:47:07.559" style="s2">doing it&#39;s a factual question in your</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.559" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">opinion like your studied opinion like</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.559" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">do these two do these because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">get a clear sense in the article what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:15.720" style="s2">the relationship between them is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:18.030" style="s2">friendly is it biological or are they</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.720" end="00:47:20.190" style="s2">sort of isolated from each other do they</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.030" end="00:47:21.900" style="s2">talk a lot and then secondly so if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.190" end="00:47:24.359" style="s2">could answer that question first like</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.900" end="00:47:25.859" style="s2">this this notion about abstraction I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.359" end="00:47:28.020" style="s2">mean it&#39;s in the name of your think-tank</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.859" end="00:47:29.549" style="s2">and that wonderful that that video</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.020" end="00:47:33.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that wonderful video on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.549" end="00:47:36.990" style="s2">and that that sort of you know playful</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.180" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">irony you know really abstraction is</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.990" end="00:47:41.220" style="s2">that the key yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:43.109" style="s2">and so maybe and maybe by answering the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.220" end="00:47:44.760" style="s2">first it&#39;ll give you a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.109" end="00:47:46.589" style="s2">expanding on what you mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.760" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">process so first of all I&#39;m like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.589" end="00:47:50.940" style="s2">is the relationship between the two</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:52.740" style="s2">groups and then story for the pun but</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.940" end="00:47:54.599" style="s2">maybe you want it what did you abstract</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.740" end="00:47:58.200" style="s2">from that into your notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.599" end="00:48:00.839" style="s2">abstraction yeah I think I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.200" end="00:48:04.230" style="s2">sort of a sort of a healthy separation</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.839" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">in in some ways but also unhealthy like</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.230" end="00:48:09.480" style="s2">like they don&#39;t really talk that much</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:11.490" style="s2">some of some of them talk like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.480" end="00:48:13.589" style="s2">some been some crossover with Greg</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.490" end="00:48:16.829" style="s2">Denver for example he was in the side</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.589" end="00:48:19.349" style="s2">view article and and for for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.829" end="00:48:21.960" style="s2">years like we would just talk past each</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.349" end="00:48:25.230" style="s2">other you know and I actually had to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.960" end="00:48:27.150" style="s2">invoke him a medic mediator to say there</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.230" end="00:48:28.740" style="s2">is Jason Schneider I said you know bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.150" end="00:48:32.790" style="s2">us together so we can figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.740" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">and so you know so what I call the Deaf</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.790" end="00:48:37.530" style="s2">school doesn&#39;t even recognize honty you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.960" style="s2">know and which is it which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.530" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">unfortunate and interesting at the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.960" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">time because I think academically the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.720" end="00:48:49.500" style="s2">Hansie books are are quite formidable</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:52.530" style="s2">you know it shouldn&#39;t be written off you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.500" end="00:48:56.849" style="s2">know Daniel is a PhD in sociology so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.530" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">have advocated for us to to talk but</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.849" end="00:48:59.759" style="s2">it&#39;s never really half</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:01.619" style="s2">so the the two schools kind of remain</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.759" end="00:49:04.469" style="s2">distinct and of course the the original</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.619" end="00:49:05.910" style="s2">ol school doesn&#39;t really see itself as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.469" end="00:49:09.390" style="s2">school of thought they&#39;re just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.910" end="00:49:12.209" style="s2">just they&#39;re just academics but I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.390" end="00:49:14.699" style="s2">identified lots of contrasts like I say</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.209" end="00:49:17.249" style="s2">the former is more academic the latter</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.699" end="00:49:18.479" style="s2">is more para academic you know and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.249" end="00:49:20.249" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.479" end="00:49:23.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.249" end="00:49:25.619" style="s2">so it gives meta modernism this this</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.039" end="00:49:27.539" style="s2">aliveness this tension right and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.619" end="00:49:30.479" style="s2">know that and and and so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.539" end="00:49:32.130" style="s2">lieu of talking Hansie just makes a move</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.479" end="00:49:34.380" style="s2">you know I think he says in the book</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.130" end="00:49:35.969" style="s2">they kind of pirate the term from</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.380" end="00:49:40.739" style="s2">Vermeulen and band records in a footnote</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.969" end="00:49:42.719" style="s2">it&#39;s almost just in passing and and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.739" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">so there&#39;s that and and also you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.719" end="00:49:47.130" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do something different if</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:49.049" style="s2">I can by you know trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:52.799" style="s2">syncretic approach and look at the mall</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.049" end="00:49:55.829" style="s2">and you and and and particularly you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.799" end="00:49:57.539" style="s2">know convert converge because I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.829" end="00:49:59.160" style="s2">there should be a kind of unified body</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.539" end="00:50:02.329" style="s2">of work you know not to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.160" end="00:50:05.160" style="s2">homogenous it never will be but but um</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.329" end="00:50:07.049" style="s2">you know so one of one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.160" end="00:50:10.259" style="s2">love mint in my side-view article too is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.049" end="00:50:12.329" style="s2">like year after year more articles will</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.259" end="00:50:15.209" style="s2">come out on post-modernism you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.329" end="00:50:17.849" style="s2">it&#39;ll just be some hot take or new</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.209" end="00:50:21.299" style="s2">insight or whatever but it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.849" end="00:50:23.699" style="s2">know I&#39;m bewildered how people can write</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.299" end="00:50:28.289" style="s2">about this and just completely ignore</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.699" end="00:50:31.079" style="s2">other things going on you know so like</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.289" end="00:50:32.699" style="s2">like like the the book I recommend to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.079" end="00:50:34.619" style="s2">people for post-modernism is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.699" end="00:50:38.279" style="s2">postmodern turn in the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.619" end="00:50:40.499" style="s2">and that came out in 2015 and in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.279" end="00:50:43.679" style="s2">like you have you know years of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.499" end="00:50:47.279" style="s2">production of all these alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.679" end="00:50:49.529" style="s2">like meta modernism digi modernism trans</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.279" end="00:50:51.319" style="s2">modernism hyper modernism but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.529" end="00:50:53.729" style="s2">mention of any of those in the book and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.319" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">and the book is very you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.729" end="00:51:00.209" style="s2">encyclopedic and yet it still still</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:02.939" style="s2">misses these things and then it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.209" end="00:51:05.339" style="s2">epic innocence then in a sense it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.939" end="00:51:07.439" style="s2">fractal I mean it&#39;s incredible I&#39;m a can</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.339" end="00:51:09.779" style="s2">own in my article like there&#39;s 1600</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.439" end="00:51:11.220" style="s2">footnotes in the book like no books do</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.779" end="00:51:13.349" style="s2">that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.220" end="00:51:17.430" style="s2">all these endorsements from from big</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.349" end="00:51:19.619" style="s2">sociologists so you know it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.430" end="00:51:22.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very intimidating right in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.619" end="00:51:24.080" style="s2">that sense but but it gives you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.410" end="00:51:25.830" style="s2">all within it there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.080" end="00:51:27.810" style="s2">simplifications like well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.830" end="00:51:29.640" style="s2">five major turns in different fields</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.810" end="00:51:33.570" style="s2">that this you know this is what</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.640" end="00:51:36.810" style="s2">post-modernism is so um I mean right</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.570" end="00:51:39.180" style="s2">there just to highlight that point you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.810" end="00:51:41.970" style="s2">know post-modernism Italy is at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.180" end="00:51:44.369" style="s2">five things okay and and of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.970" end="00:51:46.950" style="s2">much more than that but this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.369" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">mistake the IDW makes is just collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.950" end="00:51:49.700" style="s2">it into one thing like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">relativism</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.700" end="00:52:00.090" style="s2">well relativism predates all yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:52:02.990" style="s2">even if you read like weed Foucault like</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.090" end="00:52:06.840" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk to people well it&#39;s funny to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.990" end="00:52:09.210" style="s2">broaden the critique oh this will happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.840" end="00:52:12.150" style="s2">with it with people who through you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.210" end="00:52:14.119" style="s2">speak those words and I&#39;ll say but have</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.150" end="00:52:16.770" style="s2">you read the later Foucault you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.119" end="00:52:18.869" style="s2">were the care of the south and he starts</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.770" end="00:52:21.420" style="s2">reading Pierhead oh and he gets deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.869" end="00:52:24.359" style="s2">interested in ancient philosophy and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.420" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">wisdom tradition and that&#39;s and he saw</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.359" end="00:52:29.010" style="s2">that as and I think rightly by the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:31.109" style="s2">he saw that is the culmination of what</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.010" end="00:52:33.810" style="s2">he&#39;d been working on and I said there</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.109" end="00:52:37.740" style="s2">you go yeah yeah and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.810" end="00:52:40.260" style="s2">Foucault you know mmm died before his</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.740" end="00:52:41.400" style="s2">time yeah and that that could be true</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.260" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">for a lot of thing because I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.400" end="00:52:45.540" style="s2">many thinkers have died without</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:48.030" style="s2">finishing their their magnum opus right</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.540" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">they all have unfinished manuscripts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.030" end="00:52:53.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so tragic and so that that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:57.089" style="s2">part of a big part of what meta Mara&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.730" end="00:52:58.680" style="s2">meta morgan ism is for me is is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.089" end="00:53:01.290" style="s2">trying to pick up their threads and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.680" end="00:53:03.390" style="s2">finish their project you know because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.290" end="00:53:04.950" style="s2">remember in grad school ten years ago is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.390" end="00:53:06.619" style="s2">the kind of running joke that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.950" end="00:53:10.619" style="s2">was trying to publish their manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.619" end="00:53:13.320" style="s2">yeah and and and and actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.619" end="00:53:15.960" style="s2">in 2011 Luke Turner published his meta</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.320" end="00:53:17.849" style="s2">modern manifesto which was just eight</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.960" end="00:53:20.369" style="s2">points right is really short and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.849" end="00:53:22.710" style="s2">was a kind of tongue-in-cheek joke that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.369" end="00:53:24.690" style="s2">like on a number of levels but you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.710" end="00:53:26.579" style="s2">in lieu of writing a big book it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.690" end="00:53:28.589" style="s2">this is this is it just eight points</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.579" end="00:53:33.000" style="s2">about you know oscillation and irony and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.589" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">whatnot so you know III accepted that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.000" end="00:53:37.230" style="s2">myself and I thought you know I I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.349" style="s2">to write some books of course but not</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.230" end="00:53:43.140" style="s2">too many books the the the thrust of my</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.349" end="00:53:46.770" style="s2">project is to is to try to you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.140" end="00:53:49.560" style="s2">participate in this long-term historical</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.770" end="00:53:52.859" style="s2">process of knowledge creation and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.560" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">praxis right because to you know to tie</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.859" end="00:53:58.230" style="s2">it to this idea of the meta-crisis you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:53:59.970" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s this deep thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.230" end="00:54:02.430" style="s2">you only get a salience of when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.970" end="00:54:04.980" style="s2">really developed a complex perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.430" end="00:54:07.500" style="s2">and you&#39;ve taken in a lot and you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.980" end="00:54:11.640" style="s2">channel your concern for whatever social</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.500" end="00:54:14.550" style="s2">issues that might be to singular or even</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.640" end="00:54:17.790" style="s2">superficial like veganism and and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.550" end="00:54:20.849" style="s2">vegan I advocate it you know or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.790" end="00:54:22.380" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s like or poverty it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.849" end="00:54:24.180" style="s2">okay that&#39;s one thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.380" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">meta-crisis is all these things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.180" end="00:54:30.540" style="s2">connected yes and we reproduce it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">almost everything we do right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.540" end="00:54:36.300" style="s2">the tragic irony of humanity is just how</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:39.810" style="s2">how uh how how smart we can be and how</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.300" end="00:54:42.390" style="s2">likes like transcendently stupid we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.810" end="00:54:43.980" style="s2">be and and just disconnected from each</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.390" end="00:54:45.480" style="s2">others worlds and projects and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.980" end="00:54:47.970" style="s2">internet brings all that back together</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.480" end="00:54:50.060" style="s2">right this globalization process which</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.970" end="00:54:54.780" style="s2">has been happening for millennia is</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.060" end="00:54:56.849" style="s2">actually converging into a climax and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.780" end="00:54:58.619" style="s2">it&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to figure out so</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.849" end="00:55:01.170" style="s2">before you get into that because I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.619" end="00:55:02.130" style="s2">tell you that Villa mental I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.170" end="00:55:04.920" style="s2">to lose the thread because I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.130" end="00:55:07.109" style="s2">you&#39;re also germinating an answer to my</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.920" end="00:55:09.480" style="s2">second question was sort of your take on</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.109" end="00:55:11.460" style="s2">like what you have like your notion of</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.480" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">abstraction and what you&#39;re taking from</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.460" end="00:55:17.460" style="s2">this because it sounds to me like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.460" end="00:55:20.490" style="s2">you&#39;re for grounding the meta crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.460" end="00:55:22.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s dynamical complexity as</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.490" end="00:55:24.780" style="s2">something that you think meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.500" end="00:55:27.810" style="s2">should be addressing centrally is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.780" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">is that fair yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.810" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">bang on and actually I have to mention</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.270" end="00:55:36.180" style="s2">because it pops into my head this is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.760" end="00:55:38.430" style="s2">an availability bias thing kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.180" end="00:55:41.130" style="s2">but in 2015 there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.430" end="00:55:45.420" style="s2">article titled the meta-crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.130" end="00:55:47.790" style="s2">secular capitalism and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.420" end="00:55:49.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not typically what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.790" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">about when we talk about this term but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.710" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">like it and that article in particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:57.359" style="s2">highlights abstraction as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:56:00.420" style="s2">key right financial abstraction so</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.359" end="00:56:02.970" style="s2">capitalism abstracts and that that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.420" end="00:56:05.700" style="s2">is a whole other conversation to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.970" end="00:56:07.859" style="s2">or but let me just start over this term</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.700" end="00:56:08.730" style="s2">for open up this term as you want as you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.859" end="00:56:12.869" style="s2">intend to use it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.730" end="00:56:15.030" style="s2">abstraction yeah please so um so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.869" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">try to just say something about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.030" end="00:56:20.190" style="s2">article because it&#39;s basically about you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:23.160" style="s2">know the the the falling rate of profit</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.190" end="00:56:26.309" style="s2">and and and there&#39;s some implicitness</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.160" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">about you know just the you know can</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.309" end="00:56:31.500" style="s2">have infinite growth kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:33.569" style="s2">capitalism is in crisis right but but so</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.500" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">to bring it back to the beginning so in</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.569" end="00:56:36.980" style="s2">in all my studies you know and i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.000" end="00:56:39.420" style="s2">we all have this to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.980" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">abstraction has come up in near work but</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.420" end="00:56:42.420" style="s2">i would i would come across this term</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:45.710" style="s2">you know and you read about like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.420" end="00:56:49.260" style="s2">absolute you know in philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.710" end="00:56:51.569" style="s2">abductive logic you know abduction and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.260" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">actually you you say in your article</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.569" end="00:56:56.490" style="s2">that you&#39;re using inference to the best</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:58.140" style="s2">explanation yes that is abduction that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.490" end="00:56:59.970" style="s2">is a deductive logic that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.140" end="00:57:04.980" style="s2">called and and so this is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.970" end="00:57:06.210" style="s2">like this is actually like if I&#39;m if</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.980" end="00:57:08.609" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.210" end="00:57:10.410" style="s2">such a common approach you know or</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.609" end="00:57:12.450" style="s2">subtle than induction and deduction</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.410" end="00:57:14.460" style="s2">right those are the marriages people</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.450" end="00:57:17.130" style="s2">take yeah Brett my reason for not using</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.460" end="00:57:19.890" style="s2">the term abduction is just as people</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.130" end="00:57:23.700" style="s2">always misunderstand what it means and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.890" end="00:57:26.760" style="s2">and I was very influenced by especially</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.700" end="00:57:28.680" style="s2">by Lipton and others who are recap and</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.760" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s a little bit of a cottage</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.680" end="00:57:32.760" style="s2">industry around this inference to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:35.430" style="s2">best explanation yeah I found to be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.760" end="00:57:38.250" style="s2">best interpretation of Darwin and etc so</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.430" end="00:57:41.490" style="s2">yes and the reason why that comes up and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.250" end="00:57:44.190" style="s2">this is how maybe I somewhat like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.490" end="00:57:46.260" style="s2">and being a generalist because cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.190" end="00:57:47.640" style="s2">science you you know you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.260" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">specializing with one of the home</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.640" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">disciplines you have to read deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:52.020" style="s2">study deeply and all of them but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:54.330" style="s2">trying to get us in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.020" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">ethic integration which requires this</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.330" end="00:58:00.660" style="s2">kind of adaptive reasoning is that part</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:02.490" style="s2">of what you&#39;re pointing towards that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.660" end="00:58:05.580" style="s2">sort of abductive reasoning when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.490" end="00:58:07.920" style="s2">talking about down yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.580" end="00:58:09.810" style="s2">oh that&#39;s absolutely fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.920" end="00:58:11.700" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s the hallmark of</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.810" end="00:58:13.800" style="s2">science I think it doesn&#39;t work in terms</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.700" end="00:58:15.060" style="s2">of sorry I&#39;ll stop in a second I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.800" end="00:58:16.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work in terms of certainty I</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.060" end="00:58:18.990" style="s2">think it works in terms of a different</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.920" end="00:58:22.260" style="s2">normative &#39;ti plausibility which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.990" end="00:58:25.230" style="s2">been trying to get clearer about and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.260" end="00:58:28.190" style="s2">thing about it is for me as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.230" end="00:58:31.950" style="s2">scientist that&#39;s the form of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.190" end="00:58:33.930" style="s2">that really and this is a point I owe to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.950" end="00:58:35.220" style="s2">Jerry Fodor is really dependent on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.930" end="00:58:37.050" style="s2">whole process that I talked about is</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.220" end="00:58:39.960" style="s2">relevance realization which already is</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.050" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">really really key so I just want to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.960" end="00:58:44.910" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:48.120" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s just a lot that I can it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.910" end="00:58:50.580" style="s2">not IntelliJ I can get into it I need it</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.120" end="00:58:52.290" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying go ahead that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.580" end="00:58:55.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly why I mentioned your</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.290" end="00:58:57.740" style="s2">article and and you know I&#39;ve alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.170" end="00:59:00.510" style="s2">your other work on abstraction because</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.740" end="00:59:04.200" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a good chance like well</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.510" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">I&#39;m certain that in in some of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.200" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">regard you&#39;re you&#39;ll you&#39;re more of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:10.920" style="s2">specialist of abstraction than I am</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:14.040" style="s2">right and so is Benjamin Bratton right</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.920" end="00:59:16.710" style="s2">and that this is why I defer to them but</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.040" end="00:59:19.770" style="s2">it&#39;s just so fir to wind it back for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.710" end="00:59:22.290" style="s2">sake of kind of telling the story what</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.770" end="00:59:24.900" style="s2">happened to me 10 years ago was you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.290" end="00:59:26.610" style="s2">abstraction kept coming up and also it</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.900" end="00:59:28.890" style="s2">means different things in like abstract</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.610" end="00:59:30.210" style="s2">art and you know I always it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.890" end="00:59:33.090" style="s2">interesting I always thought abstract</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.210" end="00:59:35.430" style="s2">art was stupid and like like why is this</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.090" end="00:59:37.860" style="s2">picture of a square worth so much money</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.430" end="00:59:40.890" style="s2">and and and stimulating so much thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.860" end="00:59:44.580" style="s2">and debate in people detail is making me</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.890" end="00:59:46.740" style="s2">angry but then you know I I developed a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.580" end="00:59:49.080" style="s2">sort of deep appreciation for it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.740" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">just abstraction in general and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.080" end="00:59:53.700" style="s2">term comes up in all these different</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">sources in in in in cores if ski you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.700" end="01:00:01.170" style="s2">know and systems-thinking in marks right</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="01:00:03.780" style="s2">and Hegel and and you know Nietzsche I</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.170" end="01:00:05.970" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s everywhere and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.780" end="01:00:09.010" style="s2">nowhere at the same time because</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.970" end="01:00:11.230" style="s2">i-i-i i started to just develop a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.010" end="01:00:12.670" style="s2">practice of aggregating these sources i</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.230" end="01:00:15.640" style="s2">have hundreds and hundreds of sources</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.670" end="01:00:17.860" style="s2">and like with meta modernism it took me</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.640" end="01:00:20.020" style="s2">a while to kind of get the ball rolling</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.860" end="01:00:23.740" style="s2">there because i just found it really</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.020" end="01:00:26.350" style="s2">elusive really hard to track and and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.740" end="01:00:28.330" style="s2">and you know i bring up that meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.350" end="01:00:30.940" style="s2">of secular capitalism article because</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.330" end="01:00:34.750" style="s2">it&#39;s got abstraction right in the thesis</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.940" end="01:00:36.250" style="s2">and also a book by Serna check and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.750" end="01:00:39.970" style="s2">Williams called inventing the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.250" end="01:00:42.220" style="s2">right by verso press the leftist press</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.970" end="01:00:44.680" style="s2">and and they have a lot of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.220" end="01:00:46.210" style="s2">in that book and it&#39;s like I would find</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.680" end="01:00:48.760" style="s2">it in all these places and find it</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.210" end="01:00:50.500" style="s2">talked about really cogently and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.760" end="01:00:53.020" style="s2">really brilliantly these these people</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.500" end="01:00:55.180" style="s2">know their work but there was no meta</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.020" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">theory behind it there was nothing tying</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.180" end="01:00:59.140" style="s2">all the abstraction together and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:01.900" style="s2">perhaps you know an impossible project</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.140" end="01:01:04.030" style="s2">but at minimum I&#39;m trying to you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.900" end="01:01:06.750" style="s2">chronicle and catalogue all the sources</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.030" end="01:01:09.730" style="s2">because I just keep finding more and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.750" end="01:01:12.730" style="s2">you know this is I&#39;ve written like you</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.730" end="01:01:15.430" style="s2">know you know 1314 articles on some</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.730" end="01:01:17.500" style="s2">abstract some aspect of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.430" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">right financial abstraction meditative</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.500" end="01:01:24.370" style="s2">abstraction and art and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.160" end="01:01:28.660" style="s2">and so this is why with my project like</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.370" end="01:01:32.350" style="s2">it became artistic thing became a became</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.660" end="01:01:35.770" style="s2">a film and it became a research project</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.350" end="01:01:38.440" style="s2">a think-tank and and so you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.770" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">still this is still in motion I still</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.440" end="01:01:44.440" style="s2">have to you know read a lot more and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:47.350" style="s2">process a lot more but but I know in</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.440" end="01:01:49.270" style="s2">aggregating that stuff like it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.350" end="01:01:51.370" style="s2">puts me ahead of the curve in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.270" end="01:01:55.000" style="s2">just because it&#39;s such a monumental task</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.370" end="01:01:57.220" style="s2">you know I&#39;m trying to like you know and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.000" end="01:01:58.750" style="s2">you know G that comes to mind because</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.220" end="01:02:02.770" style="s2">he&#39;s me you know every time someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.750" end="01:02:04.840" style="s2">mentions abstract in their speech it you</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.770" end="01:02:05.770" style="s2">know I log it in my memory and I you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.840" end="01:02:07.120" style="s2">know think about what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.770" end="01:02:09.310" style="s2">say what it means in the big picture and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.120" end="01:02:13.060" style="s2">she&#39;s actually in over fifty bucks</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.310" end="01:02:14.860" style="s2">right he&#39;s prolific and so of course you</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.060" end="01:02:17.110" style="s2">know Peterson didn&#39;t even bother</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.860" end="01:02:19.180" style="s2">cracking one to prepare for the debate</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.110" end="01:02:21.640" style="s2">this is too much and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.180" end="01:02:25.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve read a bit of jiseok and seen him</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.640" end="01:02:28.660" style="s2">talk a bunch of times but you know it</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.510" end="01:02:30.040" style="s2">also just goes on and on and so people</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.660" end="01:02:32.380" style="s2">get kind of tired of them and people</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.040" end="01:02:35.710" style="s2">have their critiques of jiseok so but</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.380" end="01:02:38.349" style="s2">the steam of abstraction you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.710" end="01:02:40.300" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.349" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">subtle and then it gets buried in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.300" end="01:02:44.800" style="s2">research that is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:46.660" style="s2">reproduction of the meta-crisis and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.800" end="01:02:48.849" style="s2">there&#39;s a book from 1973 called the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.660" end="01:02:50.770" style="s2">abstract society and that was really</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.849" end="01:02:52.720" style="s2">formative free because it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.770" end="01:02:54.849" style="s2">huge book but it&#39;s very dense and its</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.720" end="01:02:56.770" style="s2">thesis is basically you know society is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.849" end="01:02:59.309" style="s2">getting more abstract and he identifies</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.770" end="01:03:01.530" style="s2">these these trends like you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.309" end="01:03:03.640" style="s2">bureaucratize ation of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.530" end="01:03:06.790" style="s2">specialization these are now like sub</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.640" end="01:03:08.829" style="s2">functions of abstraction and they all</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.790" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">they all add up and you know we just</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.829" end="01:03:14.190" style="s2">have this increasingly complex world and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:16.750" style="s2">so to to bring it back before I forget</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.190" end="01:03:19.660" style="s2">with capital right so because Marx</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.750" end="01:03:21.900" style="s2">talked about commodity abstraction right</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.660" end="01:03:24.700" style="s2">and and and what what they call real</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.900" end="01:03:26.440" style="s2">abstraction and there&#39;s a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.700" end="01:03:28.359" style="s2">kind of speculative realists that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.440" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">write about this too like rain brassy</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.359" end="01:03:32.920" style="s2">and like this is like it&#39;s the super</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:34.510" style="s2">dense writing very hard to penetrate the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.920" end="01:03:36.609" style="s2">only one of those guys that I&#39;ve read in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.510" end="01:03:38.650" style="s2">depth is Harman so I&#39;d I say all right</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.609" end="01:03:40.900" style="s2">ok only connection I have with it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.650" end="01:03:44.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a sense of it but that&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.900" end="01:03:47.710" style="s2">read a little bit of Morton yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.980" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">yeah so so to crystallize it basically a</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.710" end="01:03:52.630" style="s2">lot of these authors throughout history</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">in particular some of these guys they</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.630" end="01:03:57.099" style="s2">say there&#39;s not just mental abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:58.809" style="s2">right because that&#39;s because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.099" end="01:04:00.910" style="s2">especially as a cognitive psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.809" end="01:04:01.900" style="s2">that might be what you what preoccupies</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.910" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">a lot of your interest</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.900" end="01:04:06.609" style="s2">yeah but they say there&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:09.339" style="s2">mental abstractions there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.609" end="01:04:12.280" style="s2">abstraction in the world like material</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.339" end="01:04:14.829" style="s2">abstraction and and it&#39;s this is super</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.280" end="01:04:15.819" style="s2">interesting and really difficult what</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.829" end="01:04:18.849" style="s2">does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.819" end="01:04:20.440" style="s2">what does that mean yeah I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.849" end="01:04:24.970" style="s2">like set up is how difficult it is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.440" end="01:04:27.040" style="s2">explain it means you know we we abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.970" end="01:04:28.900" style="s2">the world in the world abstracts us you</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.040" end="01:04:30.790" style="s2">know this is just a process we&#39;re locked</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.900" end="01:04:32.720" style="s2">into it&#39;s like the idea of like thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.790" end="01:04:34.760" style="s2">you know ideas think you or</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.720" end="01:04:36.950" style="s2">ideas work through you rather than you</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.760" end="01:04:38.450" style="s2">think ideas so can I just nail down the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.950" end="01:04:40.430" style="s2">reference of the world you&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.450" end="01:04:43.790" style="s2">mean yeah we&#39;re sort of like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:47.150" style="s2">socio-cultural world it is is abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.790" end="01:04:50.270" style="s2">or do you actually mean the material</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.150" end="01:04:52.700" style="s2">world so so I&#39;ll get to this so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.270" end="01:04:56.030" style="s2">identifying a lot of these authors say</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.700" end="01:04:57.830" style="s2">that there&#39;s two major forms which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.030" end="01:05:01.250" style="s2">the thinking and the kind of material</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.830" end="01:05:04.010" style="s2">that they call real abstraction and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.250" end="01:05:06.580" style="s2">unpack that but just quickly you know I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.010" end="01:05:09.080" style="s2">did an article called integral</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.580" end="01:05:11.210" style="s2">abstraction where I put it in the four</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.080" end="01:05:13.130" style="s2">quadrants right so this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.210" end="01:05:14.750" style="s2">really useful because because I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.130" end="01:05:17.300" style="s2">what most authors are saying oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.750" end="01:05:23.090" style="s2">just two there&#39;s actually four so so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.300" end="01:05:27.500" style="s2">say there&#39;s mental abstraction mMmmm</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.090" end="01:05:30.080" style="s2">fuck it mental abstraction physical</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.500" end="01:05:33.560" style="s2">abstraction social abstraction and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.080" end="01:05:36.530" style="s2">material abstraction mental material and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.560" end="01:05:38.660" style="s2">physical yeah so some material would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.530" end="01:05:43.880" style="s2">the upper right quadrant which is like</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.660" end="01:05:45.859" style="s2">the the individual as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.880" end="01:05:49.490" style="s2">collective so material is that on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.859" end="01:05:55.130" style="s2">collective level okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.490" end="01:05:56.810" style="s2">and so so oh yeah I mean I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.130" end="01:05:59.990" style="s2">to just keep it in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.810" end="01:06:05.119" style="s2">binary frame cuz it&#39;s just plain but but</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.990" end="01:06:07.130" style="s2">but just a social abstraction which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.119" end="01:06:07.849" style="s2">not part of the binary that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.130" end="01:06:10.520" style="s2">lower left</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.849" end="01:06:12.859" style="s2">that&#39;s the ideas that we share right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.520" end="01:06:15.380" style="s2">the idea of a nation is a social</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.859" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">abstraction and so there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.380" end="01:06:19.640" style="s2">quadrants are connected there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:21.530" style="s2">individual component to it all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.640" end="01:06:23.300" style="s2">George Herbert Mead kind of idea right</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.530" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">that kind of abstraction I get that okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.300" end="01:06:28.520" style="s2">okay yeah and and and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:30.770" style="s2">integration between these fields in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.520" end="01:06:32.119" style="s2">different scholar scholarly traditions I</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.770" end="01:06:33.980" style="s2">mean there might be implicitly there</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.119" end="01:06:37.250" style="s2">might be a little bit explicitly but but</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.980" end="01:06:41.930" style="s2">what I was reading is most of them just</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.250" end="01:06:43.990" style="s2">for simple yet complex sake they say</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.930" end="01:06:46.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s mental abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.990" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">material and so Marx talks</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.490" end="01:06:50.990" style="s2">commodity abstraction and the point with</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:55.880" style="s2">that is that is that the abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.990" end="01:06:59.330" style="s2">becomes like reified right it becomes it</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.880" end="01:07:03.860" style="s2">just it becomes its own acting agent</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.330" end="01:07:05.180" style="s2">that then that then you know creates the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.860" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">world that we live in and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.180" end="01:07:10.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a diet a dialectic process there</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:13.280" style="s2">and and Bratton takes it way deeper he</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.790" end="01:07:14.840" style="s2">he talks about primordial abstraction he</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.280" end="01:07:18.080" style="s2">goes and so does Peterson they go way</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.840" end="01:07:21.470" style="s2">back in time to when we were just you</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.080" end="01:07:23.980" style="s2">know simple organisms and and the so so</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.470" end="01:07:27.710" style="s2">animals abstract right but only in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.980" end="01:07:30.410" style="s2">capacity of like sensing mapping you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.710" end="01:07:32.540" style="s2">know for for food Friend or Foe so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.410" end="01:07:34.760" style="s2">very primitive type of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.540" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">then what what Peterson says is you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.760" end="01:07:39.740" style="s2">we kind of evolved and we go up and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">that that map&#39;s higher and higher to</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.740" end="01:07:45.530" style="s2">philosophy ultimately like in play it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:49.040" style="s2">a theory he gets that&#39;s Romero Sloane I</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.530" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the idea right yeah pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.040" end="01:07:56.030" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:59.060" style="s2">idea yeah yeah so so again just to kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.030" end="01:08:00.530" style="s2">of you know hedge my bets here the</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.060" end="01:08:02.510" style="s2">material abstraction is really difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.530" end="01:08:05.390" style="s2">to talk about the you know the commodity</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.510" end="01:08:05.930" style="s2">form and yeah I&#39;m trying to get it is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.390" end="01:08:11.170" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.930" end="01:08:13.460" style="s2">well I offer this as a possible bridging</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.170" end="01:08:15.109" style="s2">analogy because I&#39;m trying to get it you</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.460" end="01:08:17.480" style="s2">don&#39;t get it I&#39;m trying to get it so</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.109" end="01:08:19.130" style="s2">Aristotle talks about what I would call</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.480" end="01:08:22.250" style="s2">like a metaphysical kind of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.130" end="01:08:24.500" style="s2">in that you have inanimate matter and it</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.250" end="01:08:26.540" style="s2">gets informed and it becomes animate</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.500" end="01:08:29.060" style="s2">matter and that&#39;s more abstract than</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.540" end="01:08:32.660" style="s2">right and till trying to fix up on this</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.060" end="01:08:34.250" style="s2">and then animate right it gets it</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.660" end="01:08:37.069" style="s2">informed at another level of recursion</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.250" end="01:08:38.900" style="s2">and it becomes you know psychological</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.069" end="01:08:42.620" style="s2">and then ultimately rational and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.900" end="01:08:45.049" style="s2">rational is this is a it&#39;s an act is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.620" end="01:08:47.660" style="s2">abstract form of being that can can self</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.049" end="01:08:49.100" style="s2">abstract and self realized and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.660" end="01:08:50.660" style="s2">a metaphysical abstraction it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.100" end="01:08:52.490" style="s2">taking place in the on buddy of mine</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.660" end="01:08:55.759" style="s2">it&#39;s the yeah in the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.490" end="01:08:57.259" style="s2">structure of beer yeah getting closer to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.759" end="01:09:00.410" style="s2">what you&#39;re you&#39;re talking about or is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.259" end="01:09:02.270" style="s2">it yeah I think I think maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.410" end="01:09:04.760" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a better kind of heuristic</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.270" end="01:09:07.540" style="s2">even because you have a whole scale</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.760" end="01:09:10.100" style="s2">there but what I&#39;m talking about it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.540" end="01:09:11.690" style="s2">slightly different I mean it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.100" end="01:09:13.790" style="s2">all connected but let me try to bring it</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.690" end="01:09:15.830" style="s2">back to Joe&#39;s talking about commodities</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.790" end="01:09:18.680" style="s2">but then that that that abstracts into a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.830" end="01:09:22.250" style="s2">higher form of money right and so with</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.680" end="01:09:23.480" style="s2">finance financial abstraction right we</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.250" end="01:09:25.640" style="s2">you know you just have more and more</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.480" end="01:09:28.190" style="s2">complex forms of money and finance and</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.640" end="01:09:29.870" style="s2">that that is distance from the material</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.190" end="01:09:31.550" style="s2">world right so there&#39;s so much distance</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.870" end="01:09:33.470" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t know if you know about</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.550" end="01:09:35.600" style="s2">modern monetary theory but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.470" end="01:09:38.360" style="s2">kind of catchphrase that is becoming</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.600" end="01:09:40.340" style="s2">more and more popular and and I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.360" end="01:09:42.290" style="s2">something I wrote about for for Thomas</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.340" end="01:09:45.650" style="s2">Bjorkman that&#39;ll that&#39;ll come out soon</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.290" end="01:09:47.630" style="s2">but it&#39;s a day-by-day there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.650" end="01:09:51.500" style="s2">coming out on it it&#39;s basically the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.630" end="01:09:53.360" style="s2">theory that you know States and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.500" end="01:09:55.520" style="s2">Federal Reserve you know have the kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.360" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">of prerogative to just print money right</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.520" end="01:10:00.020" style="s2">just add numbers to the ledger</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:02.870" style="s2">and that is possible because of how</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.020" end="01:10:04.580" style="s2">advanced capitalism has become in terms</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.870" end="01:10:06.920" style="s2">of abstraction yeah in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.580" end="01:10:08.990" style="s2">abstraction exactly and it&#39;s become so</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.920" end="01:10:10.670" style="s2">advanced that we can&#39;t keep up with it</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.990" end="01:10:13.220" style="s2">and we don&#39;t even know what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.670" end="01:10:15.500" style="s2">and so so modern monetary theory is</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.220" end="01:10:17.330" style="s2">already employed when there&#39;s a stimulus</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.500" end="01:10:21.080" style="s2">package and it goes to you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.330" end="01:10:23.960" style="s2">corporations and and whatnot and so that</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.080" end="01:10:25.790" style="s2">that is very capitalist because you</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.960" end="01:10:29.720" style="s2">actually want that money to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.790" end="01:10:32.600" style="s2">hands of people right and so the debate</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.720" end="01:10:34.610" style="s2">about modern monetary theory is is how</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.600" end="01:10:36.830" style="s2">we add numbers to the ledger and what we</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.610" end="01:10:38.990" style="s2">spend it on right and so bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.830" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">back to politics and what will keep it</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.990" end="01:10:42.860" style="s2">on abstraction but just to finish this</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:44.570" style="s2">money point you know we need to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.860" end="01:10:46.370" style="s2">money more available to people and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.570" end="01:10:48.650" style="s2">need to spend it on on development</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.370" end="01:10:51.770" style="s2">social infrastructure not not bombs that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.650" end="01:10:53.420" style="s2">just blow up that money you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.770" end="01:10:56.140" style="s2">this is what capitalism does though</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.420" end="01:10:58.910" style="s2">through its functions of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.140" end="01:11:00.890" style="s2">and particularly the advanced forms of</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.910" end="01:11:02.900" style="s2">finance and now cryptocurrencies and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.890" end="01:11:05.270" style="s2">we need to reverse that trend in some</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.900" end="01:11:07.880" style="s2">ways and we also put like get out in</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.270" end="01:11:10.700" style="s2">front of it and and you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.880" end="01:11:12.140" style="s2">stop a whole grade so and I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.700" end="01:11:13.580" style="s2">meaning this question facetiously I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.140" end="01:11:14.300" style="s2">it&#39;s seriously given what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.580" end="01:11:15.980" style="s2">a moment ago</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.300" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">about the fact that the complexification</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.980" end="01:11:20.900" style="s2">is dynamical right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:24.170" style="s2">complexification it the complexification</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.900" end="01:11:26.390" style="s2">is complexified but it&#39;s it&#39;s going up</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.170" end="01:11:28.190" style="s2">an anomaly in your fashion I mean how do</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.390" end="01:11:29.960" style="s2">and I mean this question seriously how</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.190" end="01:11:32.230" style="s2">do we get out in front of that it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.960" end="01:11:37.430" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s got a runaway you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.230" end="01:11:39.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve got the answer that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.430" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not easy but it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.680" end="01:11:43.370" style="s2">you phrase the question sets me up</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:45.620" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s great to take it</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.370" end="01:11:47.900" style="s2">back to you know what do we do about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.620" end="01:11:50.090" style="s2">in the mental abstraction so part of my</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.900" end="01:11:51.830" style="s2">work is trying to unpack the mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.090" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">and the fallacies we&#39;re making in our</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.830" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">own mental abstraction yeah you know and</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:12:00.260" style="s2">so you know we need a mass education</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:02.890" style="s2">universal education so that the average</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.260" end="01:12:06.050" style="s2">person has better mental abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.890" end="01:12:08.210" style="s2">faculties to get whole world is this</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.050" end="01:12:09.680" style="s2">where your work sort of intersects with</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.210" end="01:12:11.660" style="s2">Zach&#39;s work ever than that yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.680" end="01:12:13.190" style="s2">yours right because you want people to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.660" end="01:12:14.750" style="s2">have better relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.190" end="01:12:16.310" style="s2">all these things right you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.750" end="01:12:18.620" style="s2">always bringing it back to the system</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.310" end="01:12:21.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s not enough to like build</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.620" end="01:12:22.460" style="s2">out these these capacities in small</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.170" end="01:12:25.730" style="s2">groups right you need to actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.460" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">advocate for universal education right</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.730" end="01:12:29.630" style="s2">yeah this is why I&#39;m so passionate about</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:32.360" style="s2">Bernie Sanders because he had a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.630" end="01:12:34.940" style="s2">broad platform that included you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.360" end="01:12:38.780" style="s2">green New Deal jobs guarantee and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.940" end="01:12:40.430" style="s2">know debt forgiveness and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.780" end="01:12:42.170" style="s2">free college you know this stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.430" end="01:12:46.250" style="s2">really really important it has</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.170" end="01:12:49.670" style="s2">consequences and so so to frame it in</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.250" end="01:12:52.640" style="s2">terms of how we ideologically abstract</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.670" end="01:12:54.320" style="s2">and I&#39;m how we debated not even debated</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.640" end="01:12:57.350" style="s2">we just argued over the past four years</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.320" end="01:12:59.240" style="s2">about about you know who wore it well or</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.350" end="01:13:01.490" style="s2">whatever you know we have the dumbest</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.240" end="01:13:03.590" style="s2">conversations about politics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.490" end="01:13:04.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s a function of bad abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.590" end="01:13:06.170" style="s2">actually what I caught what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.700" end="01:13:09.020" style="s2">vicious abstraction so you know William</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.170" end="01:13:12.740" style="s2">James talked about vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.020" end="01:13:14.750" style="s2">yes yes I&#39;m James was an influence on</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.740" end="01:13:16.100" style="s2">you because yeah what you&#39;re saying a</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.750" end="01:13:18.890" style="s2">lot mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.100" end="01:13:21.500" style="s2">yeah and so that particular concept has</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.890" end="01:13:24.140" style="s2">a kind of twofold implications here one</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.500" end="01:13:26.660" style="s2">is just the the general bad abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.140" end="01:13:27.830" style="s2">out there like I&#39;ve used can use Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.660" end="01:13:29.620" style="s2">Peters&#39;s Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.830" end="01:13:33.020" style="s2">as an example because look at how he</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.620" end="01:13:35.740" style="s2">abstracts the concept of things like</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.020" end="01:13:38.330" style="s2">Marxism or feminism right he viciously</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.740" end="01:13:42.170" style="s2">literally viciously aggressively and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.330" end="01:13:44.390" style="s2">kind of violently collapses it into</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.170" end="01:13:46.970" style="s2">singular meaning like Oh Marxism equals</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.390" end="01:13:49.250" style="s2">communism actually you can&#39;t get more</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.970" end="01:13:51.320" style="s2">anti intellectual than that on that</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.250" end="01:13:54.230" style="s2">topic because that&#39;s like McCarthyism</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.320" end="01:13:56.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it&#39;s for closing thought</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.230" end="01:13:58.550" style="s2">and discussion right and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.600" end="01:14:00.230" style="s2">vicious abstraction but the context in</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.550" end="01:14:03.580" style="s2">which I use this concept is actually an</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.230" end="01:14:07.190" style="s2">article about systemic racism because</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.580" end="01:14:09.380" style="s2">because it&#39;s interesting you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.190" end="01:14:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a Republican</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.380" end="01:14:14.900" style="s2">strategist named Lee Atwater in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.160" end="01:14:17.720" style="s2">active in the 60s and 70s and and he</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.900" end="01:14:20.030" style="s2">uses the words abstract he&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.720" end="01:14:21.890" style="s2">know we we used to use these slurs but</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.030" end="01:14:24.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that anymore so what we</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.890" end="01:14:27.980" style="s2">done is we abstracted the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.700" end="01:14:30.440" style="s2">politics and so you know this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.980" end="01:14:32.120" style="s2">this dumbing down of culture and anti</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.440" end="01:14:34.220" style="s2">intellectualism and you know now you</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.120" end="01:14:37.010" style="s2">know the education secretary is Betsy</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.220" end="01:14:39.080" style="s2">DeVos and she&#39;s extremely anti</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.010" end="01:14:44.750" style="s2">intellectual you can hear he just</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.080" end="01:14:47.960" style="s2">anti-education anti-alien air she&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.750" end="01:14:50.600" style="s2">these things called what is it the the</p>

<p begin="01:14:50.600" end="01:14:55.580" style="s2">schools yeah mmm-hmm right and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.900" end="01:14:57.530" style="s2">like there&#39;s so much going on there</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.580" end="01:14:59.840" style="s2">mmm-hmm and what we need is more</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.530" end="01:15:02.600" style="s2">universal access to quality education</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.840" end="01:15:04.100" style="s2">right and you know big let lamentation</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.600" end="01:15:05.930" style="s2">for a lot of us is like they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.100" end="01:15:10.010" style="s2">teach critical thinking in high school</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.930" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">you know like this is basic but but part</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.010" end="01:15:15.260" style="s2">of the critique of education is you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:18.500" style="s2">just making people informed enough to</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.260" end="01:15:21.020" style="s2">work and to be a compliant kind of kind</p>

<p begin="01:15:21.020" end="01:15:25.850" style="s2">breakdown right the meaning crisis the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.390" end="01:15:28.250" style="s2">actual functional meta-crisis it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.850" end="01:15:32.180" style="s2">breaking down it is we we can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.250" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">such core weak vicious abstraction in</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.180" end="01:15:38.300" style="s2">our thinking sure isn&#39;t there also I</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:40.550" style="s2">mean I got to Thomas about this based on</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.300" end="01:15:41.300" style="s2">his work the world we create because I</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.550" end="01:15:45.110" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.300" end="01:15:46.880" style="s2">his argument was there&#39;s also been and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.110" end="01:15:48.170" style="s2">it&#39;s both an abstraction and a reduction</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.880" end="01:15:51.650" style="s2">and those don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.170" end="01:15:53.570" style="s2">contradictions to each other of our</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.650" end="01:15:56.030" style="s2">normativity because he and I gotta do a</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.570" end="01:15:57.860" style="s2">discussion about how all we we should</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.030" end="01:16:00.380" style="s2">have multiple sources of normativity</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.860" end="01:16:02.660" style="s2">this is kind of a harbor must point to</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.380" end="01:16:04.370" style="s2">but you know his point is they&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.660" end="01:16:07.280" style="s2">been defeated and we now have the de</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.370" end="01:16:10.580" style="s2">facto you know one normativity of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.280" end="01:16:12.950" style="s2">market and then and this this this</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.580" end="01:16:14.660" style="s2">strikes me as convergent with Zack is</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.950" end="01:16:17.510" style="s2">that can I&#39;ve talked about this about</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.660" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">you know how the market the market</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.510" end="01:16:22.280" style="s2">normativity has become the sole basis by</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:29.660" style="s2">which we&#39;re evaluating educational</p>

<p begin="01:16:29.660" end="01:16:32.690" style="s2">to me I&#39;m not saying that economic we</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.300" end="01:16:48.500" style="s2">normativity there is not the market the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.190" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">normativity there is virtue or you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.500" end="01:16:53.390" style="s2">you know of course there&#39;s critiques of</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:54.760" style="s2">the Platonic vision I&#39;m just pointing</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.760" end="01:16:58.970" style="s2">you know all through the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:00.950" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a religious normativity rather</p>

<p begin="01:17:05.030" end="01:17:10.790" style="s2">the liberal a turn right high ideals</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.850" end="01:17:12.560" style="s2">there yes well my ideals but they</p>

<p begin="01:17:18.170" end="01:17:22.310" style="s2">and then we have basically put that all</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.150" end="01:17:25.790" style="s2">aside for this other normativity which</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.310" end="01:17:27.500" style="s2">got which seems to be I take this to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.790" end="01:17:30.020" style="s2">as a critique it seems to be and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.500" end="01:17:33.140" style="s2">yours it seems to be failing us in our</p>

<p begin="01:17:42.530" end="01:17:46.610" style="s2">that used to be the project the project</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.480" end="01:17:49.340" style="s2">right and we probably and then we tried</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.610" end="01:17:50.930" style="s2">I think it already a diminished version</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.340" end="01:17:53.000" style="s2">but we tried making good citizens and</p>

<p begin="01:17:53.000" end="01:17:57.860" style="s2">making good consumers</p>

<p begin="01:17:57.860" end="01:18:02.780" style="s2">nothing to a tremendous a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.960" end="01:18:07.699" style="s2">difficulties like so when I see my kids</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.780" end="01:18:10.820" style="s2">and and their cohorts the the lack of</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.820" end="01:18:14.060" style="s2">that that their education has afforded</p>

<p begin="01:18:14.060" end="01:18:17.810" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to too</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.110" end="01:18:20.179" style="s2">I think we have done them a great</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.810" end="01:18:24.020" style="s2">disservice I think we have great</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.179" end="01:18:25.880" style="s2">disservice because like I see the way a</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.020" end="01:18:27.980" style="s2">lot of them are responding to the co vid</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.880" end="01:18:29.719" style="s2">crisis and the way that&#39;s exacerbating</p>

<p begin="01:18:29.719" end="01:18:35.929" style="s2">steroids in math yeah and and they and</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.900" end="01:18:38.690" style="s2">they just don&#39;t have you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.929" end="01:18:41.389" style="s2">the the you know the self complex</p>

<p begin="01:18:51.830" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">failed to prepare them for reality so</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.580" end="01:19:00.110" style="s2">that was a bit of a rant that&#39;s great to</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:01.909" style="s2">say that yeah and it&#39;s so something I</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.110" end="01:19:04.340" style="s2">continuously try to highlight is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.909" end="01:19:06.440" style="s2">it&#39;s cut down in the most subtle ways</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.340" end="01:19:07.489" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it that&#39;s how it happens</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.489" end="01:19:14.060" style="s2">right so the liberalism in the 70s</p>

<p begin="01:19:17.750" end="01:19:22.100" style="s2">so when laws and stuff are passed like</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.150" end="01:19:24.050" style="s2">and the patriarchy Patriot Act was</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.100" end="01:19:26.000" style="s2">passed without even being read you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.050" end="01:19:28.610" style="s2">so there&#39;s so much abstraction in these</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.000" end="01:19:30.530" style="s2">documents and people who are just like I</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.610" end="01:19:32.030" style="s2">don&#39;t have time to deal with it right so</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.530" end="01:19:33.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you think neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.030" end="01:19:36.110" style="s2">happens right it&#39;s like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.710" end="01:19:38.449" style="s2">great ideas in theory and principle but</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.110" end="01:19:40.820" style="s2">but they&#39;re there you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.449" end="01:19:42.199" style="s2">vicious abstraction there and and before</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.820" end="01:19:43.670" style="s2">I forget I thought maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.199" end="01:19:46.940" style="s2">define that for people because we kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.670" end="01:19:49.940" style="s2">of just rushed over it well I mean part</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.940" end="01:19:53.300" style="s2">of what I understand James to mean is</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.940" end="01:19:55.310" style="s2">and in Whitehead and Whitehead at a</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.300" end="01:19:56.989" style="s2">similar one which is really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.310" end="01:19:59.540" style="s2">is in many ways are so different the</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.989" end="01:20:03.199" style="s2">fallacy of misplaced concreteness this</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.540" end="01:20:05.719" style="s2">idea that we can mistake our abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.199" end="01:20:07.849" style="s2">and we can we can attribute them to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.719" end="01:20:08.430" style="s2">reality and I think the phenomenologist</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.849" end="01:20:11.310" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.430" end="01:20:13.020" style="s2">Punkie and the others were also trying</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.310" end="01:20:14.130" style="s2">to put their finger on this way in their</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.020" end="01:20:15.960" style="s2">critique of what they call</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.130" end="01:20:17.700" style="s2">intellectualism not what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.960" end="01:20:20.160" style="s2">intellectualism but it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.700" end="01:20:22.080" style="s2">that what James also use the same term</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.160" end="01:20:24.090" style="s2">and again not the way you&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.080" end="01:20:27.330" style="s2">right now but this idea that we can get</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.090" end="01:20:30.960" style="s2">caught up in right the these</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.330" end="01:20:34.830" style="s2">abstractions and take them to have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.960" end="01:20:37.950" style="s2">kind of reality that we and we have we</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.830" end="01:20:40.980" style="s2">forget we forget the processes by which</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.950" end="01:20:43.040" style="s2">they emerge and we are then cut off from</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.980" end="01:20:45.000" style="s2">the life world we&#39;re cut off from what</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:47.790" style="s2">what you know what I talked about yet</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.000" end="01:20:49.470" style="s2">being actually coupled to our body to</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.790" end="01:20:52.440" style="s2">each other into the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.470" end="01:20:55.260" style="s2">what James was really really really</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.440" end="01:20:58.440" style="s2">critical of and so the idea of private</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.260" end="01:21:00.210" style="s2">ism was that and you know and I had lots</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.440" end="01:21:02.430" style="s2">of criticisms of James and how he uses</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.210" end="01:21:04.470" style="s2">this term I think he was ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.430" end="01:21:05.760" style="s2">trying to talk about relevance but</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.470" end="01:21:07.380" style="s2">that&#39;s another that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.760" end="01:21:11.100" style="s2">right that we should be paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.380" end="01:21:16.950" style="s2">to the use that these concepts perform</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.100" end="01:21:21.110" style="s2">for us and and Andres and we situate</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.950" end="01:21:23.850" style="s2">them back within how we how they are</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.110" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">conditioned by and conditioning of our</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.850" end="01:21:28.470" style="s2">in active interaction with each other in</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:29.700" style="s2">the world sorry you asked our definition</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.470" end="01:21:31.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t think a definition is quite what</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.700" end="01:21:33.990" style="s2">I gave you but that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.020" end="01:21:36.390" style="s2">characterization I think oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.990" end="01:21:37.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s a great complex</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.390" end="01:21:41.670" style="s2">definition let me try to give a simple</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:44.330" style="s2">one for for myself and for listeners</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.670" end="01:21:46.950" style="s2">because what I part of what I put in my</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.330" end="01:21:48.690" style="s2">the article on racism and when you</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.950" end="01:21:50.100" style="s2">search the term this comes up is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.690" end="01:21:51.090" style="s2">idea of vicious abstraction as</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.100" end="01:21:53.220" style="s2">misquotation</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.090" end="01:21:55.950" style="s2">and and I really like that because</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.220" end="01:21:58.050" style="s2">you&#39;re cutting off the context yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.950" end="01:22:00.060" style="s2">right and there&#39;s the last the last of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.050" end="01:22:02.100" style="s2">contextualization is games as main part</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.060" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">okay I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.100" end="01:22:06.930" style="s2">there so yeah when you misquote you</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:12.420" style="s2">literally don&#39;t pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.930" end="01:22:15.870" style="s2">context yeah yeah and there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.420" end="01:22:17.520" style="s2">types of misquotation I I go and I go</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.870" end="01:22:19.590" style="s2">into the details a little bit but just</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.520" end="01:22:22.290" style="s2">you know I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.590" end="01:22:25.050" style="s2">misquotation it&#39;s so ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.290" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">you can once you frame it in those terms</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.050" end="01:22:29.820" style="s2">you can see it everywhere right in</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:32.640" style="s2">discourse and in the framing of concepts</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.820" end="01:22:34.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just that it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.640" end="01:22:35.910" style="s2">just you just you&#39;re just cutting off</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.440" end="01:22:37.800" style="s2">part of the context that complete</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.910" end="01:22:40.530" style="s2">changes the meaning of the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.800" end="01:22:43.670" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to say or convey and this</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.530" end="01:22:47.210" style="s2">is just you know I love the word vicious</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.670" end="01:22:51.060" style="s2">because it implies a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.210" end="01:22:53.790" style="s2">violence and kind of malice even nice</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.060" end="01:22:56.160" style="s2">but also price yeah vice yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.790" end="01:22:58.710" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s oh so virtuous abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.160" end="01:23:01.320" style="s2">would be would be the opposite and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.710" end="01:23:06.390" style="s2">that is not a well-defined developed</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.320" end="01:23:10.080" style="s2">term in in in what I&#39;ve if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.390" end="01:23:11.700" style="s2">me because you did make the connection</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.080" end="01:23:15.210" style="s2">between abstraction and abduction and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.700" end="01:23:17.910" style="s2">I&#39;m glad Plato&#39;s notion of an agog a and</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.210" end="01:23:21.150" style="s2">reciprocal opening as a way of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.910" end="01:23:24.180" style="s2">get what a virtuous abstraction looks</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.150" end="01:23:26.340" style="s2">like and that&#39;s what I get from book</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.180" end="01:23:29.310" style="s2">Latinas because we&#39;re trying to stick</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.340" end="01:23:31.350" style="s2">that framework and then said yes but</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.310" end="01:23:33.000" style="s2">what&#39;s my positive existential on</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.350" end="01:23:34.940" style="s2">ultimately spiritual relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.000" end="01:23:38.490" style="s2">that framework and how can I use that</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.940" end="01:23:40.410" style="s2">try to abstract myself up to realize</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.490" end="01:23:42.690" style="s2">myself more and more and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.410" end="01:23:44.040" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.690" end="01:23:46.440" style="s2">with that notion they are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.040" end="01:23:48.390" style="s2">bring that notion back is trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.440" end="01:23:50.910" style="s2">up but what&#39;s the virtuous version of</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.390" end="01:23:52.980" style="s2">making use of this human capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.910" end="01:23:54.450" style="s2">self transcendence because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.980" end="01:23:56.610" style="s2">what that&#39;s what the abstraction is</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.450" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">actually rooted in but it&#39;s I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.610" end="01:24:01.470" style="s2">device I would argue comes from</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:03.570" style="s2">perverting that primary ability for a</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.470" end="01:24:05.910" style="s2">human self transcendence and and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.570" end="01:24:08.730" style="s2">what that means there shouldn&#39;t virtues</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.910" end="01:24:11.010" style="s2">of sub transcendence and instead of</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.730" end="01:24:12.480" style="s2">maybe giving a definition maybe trying</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.010" end="01:24:15.210" style="s2">to articulate the virtues of self</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.480" end="01:24:17.400" style="s2">transcendence would be the way of trying</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.210" end="01:24:19.590" style="s2">to articulate what and virtuous</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.400" end="01:24:21.660" style="s2">obstruction is and that&#39;s a proposal I</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.590" end="01:24:23.460" style="s2">give for you yeah and I I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.660" end="01:24:26.400" style="s2">careful here you know because what what</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.460" end="01:24:27.900" style="s2">comes to mind is the you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.400" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">schism or the contrast between</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.900" end="01:24:31.620" style="s2">psychology and sociology and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:34.680" style="s2">written about this a bit in different</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.620" end="01:24:36.160" style="s2">places it&#39;s a constant theme I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.680" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">sociological</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.160" end="01:24:41.920" style="s2">I in a world of mostly psychological</p>

<p begin="01:24:47.680" end="01:24:52.690" style="s2">the individual and you know and how</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.570" end="01:24:54.760" style="s2">could it not be right so but but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.690" end="01:24:58.590" style="s2">sorry I want to I want to get there</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.760" end="01:25:02.860" style="s2">because I mean I I have been developing</p>

<p begin="01:25:50.260" end="01:25:55.690" style="s2">but but I wish that was you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.010" end="01:25:58.090" style="s2">still have higher hopes I want to see</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.690" end="01:26:00.340" style="s2">more and you know a psychologist that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.090" end="01:26:02.230" style="s2">comes to mind right to defer it from</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.340" end="01:26:05.410" style="s2">from us completely as Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.230" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">right I made this point to to to daniel</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.410" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">Gertz yesterday is like you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:11.410" style="s2">critique and in Jacobin came out of</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:14.170" style="s2">steven pinker and you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.410" end="01:26:16.840" style="s2">headline is is a bit rude it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.170" end="01:26:19.600" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s proven Steven Pinker&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.840" end="01:26:21.610" style="s2">full of shit but the article is great</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.600" end="01:26:24.130" style="s2">right and and this is the point like</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.610" end="01:26:27.300" style="s2">Steven Pinker can&#39;t take critique right</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.130" end="01:26:29.290" style="s2">he gets into feuds with people like uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.300" end="01:26:33.250" style="s2">what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.290" end="01:26:35.590" style="s2">Phil hmm Phil Torres and many of many</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.250" end="01:26:36.970" style="s2">other people right but so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.590" end="01:26:38.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no auto critique there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.970" end="01:26:41.170" style="s2">reflexivity and and you know Pinker</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.980" end="01:26:44.040" style="s2">really leans in to the kind of brand of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.170" end="01:26:47.160" style="s2">the optimist right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.040" end="01:26:47.160" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.990" end="01:26:55.630" style="s2">you know so to make the move to</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.840" end="01:26:57.760" style="s2">sociology you know is there&#39;s heat much</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.630" end="01:26:59.740" style="s2">bigger implications for that and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.760" end="01:27:02.170" style="s2">this is why I titled my article like</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.740" end="01:27:03.490" style="s2">inside View mapping meta modernism for</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.170" end="01:27:05.170" style="s2">collective intelligence right there</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.490" end="01:27:07.180" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a lot of space to unpack that but</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.170" end="01:27:08.800" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a jab at what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.180" end="01:27:11.080" style="s2">with this term collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.800" end="01:27:12.780" style="s2">and intelligence is the operative word</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.080" end="01:27:16.570" style="s2">there because it&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.780" end="01:27:18.610" style="s2">instrumentalizing this you know whether</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.570" end="01:27:21.250" style="s2">it&#39;s in like you know Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.610" end="01:27:23.050" style="s2">communities or whatever that reinforces</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.250" end="01:27:25.210" style="s2">that distinction from like the masses of</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.050" end="01:27:27.340" style="s2">people right and and what we want to</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.210" end="01:27:29.740" style="s2">foster is intellect distributed</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.340" end="01:27:31.330" style="s2">intellect and so literacy I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.740" end="01:27:33.760" style="s2">not even a basic literacy</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.330" end="01:27:35.770" style="s2">well maybe I&#39;m talking about something</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.760" end="01:27:38.200" style="s2">similar to this then because I talk a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.770" end="01:27:40.390" style="s2">lot about because I&#39;m you know I have an</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.200" end="01:27:42.250" style="s2">attitude towards intelligence I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.390" end="01:27:44.470" style="s2">and tell that which makes this adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.250" end="01:27:48.160" style="s2">also makes us prone to self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.470" end="01:27:51.250" style="s2">and so I think I say the project should</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.160" end="01:27:53.530" style="s2">be about trying to maybe maybe you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.250" end="01:27:55.210" style="s2">like this but I think about the way I</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.530" end="01:27:56.440" style="s2">see individual wisdom as using</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.210" end="01:27:58.300" style="s2">intelligence to acquire a psycho</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.440" end="01:28:00.400" style="s2">technology of sub correction that</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.300" end="01:28:01.780" style="s2">affords rationality the way we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.400" end="01:28:03.250" style="s2">about it I&#39;ve talked about that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.780" end="01:28:04.990" style="s2">should be trying to cultivate collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.250" end="01:28:07.390" style="s2">rationality largest collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.990" end="01:28:09.850" style="s2">intelligence and I thought that to me is</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.390" end="01:28:12.460" style="s2">it is a central project right now yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.850" end="01:28:16.210" style="s2">yeah and I think with with self</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.460" end="01:28:18.910" style="s2">correction like like we can we could</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.210" end="01:28:21.610" style="s2">keep you know anything with the self</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.910" end="01:28:24.460" style="s2">again self-deception is is very is very</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.610" end="01:28:27.160" style="s2">subtle like because you know we all know</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.460" end="01:28:29.320" style="s2">geniuses that have some pathologies and</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.160" end="01:28:31.120" style="s2">and and then it&#39;s kind of a paradox and</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.320" end="01:28:33.340" style="s2">how do you challenge that person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.120" end="01:28:34.840" style="s2">like they&#39;re threatened by by your</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.340" end="01:28:36.970" style="s2">critique and then there&#39;s implications</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.840" end="01:28:39.070" style="s2">for them and how much they&#39;ve invested</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.970" end="01:28:41.830" style="s2">in that line of thought so people</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.070" end="01:28:44.350" style="s2">underestimate the implications of self</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.830" end="01:28:46.780" style="s2">critique you know of metanoia</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.350" end="01:28:50.950" style="s2">which is like a deeper spiritual and</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.780" end="01:28:52.750" style="s2">intellectual conversion I think yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.950" end="01:29:01.480" style="s2">think there&#39;s a spiritual aspect to this</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.750" end="01:29:03.530" style="s2">Brent yeah well that that okay but that</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.480" end="01:29:05.900" style="s2">first of all I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.530" end="01:29:07.820" style="s2">invite you to come back in August and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.900" end="01:29:10.880" style="s2">do another one of these four voices with</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.820" end="01:29:12.440" style="s2">verve a key and if if if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.880" end="01:29:15.110" style="s2">you&#39;re in agreement with it</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.440" end="01:29:16.520" style="s2">I&#39;d like it to zero in on that last very</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.110" end="01:29:19.030" style="s2">provocative point because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.520" end="01:29:20.840" style="s2">to just leave that sort of dangling the</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.030" end="01:29:22.369" style="s2">spirituality which is something I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.840" end="01:29:23.750" style="s2">interested and I don&#39;t like that term as</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.369" end="01:29:25.429" style="s2">you know but it&#39;s there&#39;s no other term</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.750" end="01:29:26.510" style="s2">right now the spirituality of all this</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.429" end="01:29:27.739" style="s2">because you sort of brought it out and</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.510" end="01:29:30.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve alluded to it in a couple places</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.739" end="01:29:31.579" style="s2">and you invoke the term drawn from the</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.079" end="01:29:34.369" style="s2">heart of you know Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.579" end="01:29:37.369" style="s2">Christianity metanoia so I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.369" end="01:29:40.130" style="s2">bring out because this is also an area</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.369" end="01:29:42.170" style="s2">where I think what we would talk about</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.130" end="01:29:44.270" style="s2">with intersect with laymen right the</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.170" end="01:29:46.639" style="s2">spirituality of meta modernism and what</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.270" end="01:29:49.699" style="s2">you and your project if you yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.639" end="01:29:51.469" style="s2">great okay that&#39;s perfect that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.699" end="01:29:53.360" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect because other people have</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.469" end="01:29:55.219" style="s2">been asking me about this and actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.360" end="01:29:58.630" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna talk to layman about it soon</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.219" end="01:30:01.760" style="s2">and just your full disclosure my eat my</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.630" end="01:30:06.409" style="s2">contribution to Jonathan Rosen&#39;s a meta</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.760" end="01:30:08.119" style="s2">modern book is about Metanoia but but</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.409" end="01:30:09.710" style="s2">it&#39;s up in the air whether I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.119" end="01:30:11.090" style="s2">still contribute that because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.710" end="01:30:13.699" style="s2">actually gonna try to publish on</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.090" end="01:30:14.900" style="s2">Metanoia on my blog as soon as possible</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.699" end="01:30:17.420" style="s2">because I just want to get get this</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.900" end="01:30:18.619" style="s2">content out there and and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.420" end="01:30:20.989" style="s2">talk about it so I&#39;m really glad you</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.619" end="01:30:23.329" style="s2">picked up on that at the end and I look</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.989" end="01:30:26.210" style="s2">forward to that discussion oh well great</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.329" end="01:30:28.010" style="s2">so maybe maybe what you could do and I</p>

<p begin="01:30:28.010" end="01:30:31.820" style="s2">intellectual property over it but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.960" end="01:30:34.489" style="s2">you can send me the most recent draft oh</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.820" end="01:30:35.389" style="s2">sure sure sure yeah and then I could</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.489" end="01:30:36.619" style="s2">meet it and that would give me a little</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.389" end="01:30:38.360" style="s2">bit of background that we could go into</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.619" end="01:30:42.469" style="s2">it because I mean this is a concept</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.360" end="01:30:44.630" style="s2">that&#39;s very important to me - sure Brent</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.469" end="01:30:48.130" style="s2">this has been really wonderful it&#39;s I</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.599" end="01:30:59.809" style="s2">there&#39;s points of difference but I</p>

<p begin="01:30:59.809" end="01:31:04.159" style="s2">dialogue which is and I&#39;ve said this</p>

<p begin="01:31:10.820" end="01:31:13.639" style="s2">enter into good-faith dialogue that I</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.199" end="01:31:14.900" style="s2">want to talk to them especially if</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.639" end="01:31:16.429" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing in the kind of insight</p>
