<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:27.080" style="s2">about this kind of new campaign that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:30.960" style="s2">posted all around the internet about</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.080" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">collective insight symposium and because</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.960" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that what you can post on</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">the internet formerly really does</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:43.730" style="s2">justice in describing something of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:50.449" style="s2">nature i asked even if he could help</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.730" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">elicit from me some more information and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.449" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">really whatever he wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">so thanks you&#39;re entirely welcome and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">guess we said i was going to start and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">just wanted to start by and I could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">wrong in this but I think the first time</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">we bumped into each other was during one</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:19.790" style="s2">of the magellan course offerings and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">were doing and offering on Goethe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.790" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">delicate empiricism and I you know and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">time we bumped into each other has had</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">had the shape of the way we bump into</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">each other a lot and that is I posted</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">something that either is was that a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">context or seemed out of context to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">and seemed to be highly not very</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">flattering tiger thur or the really neat</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">of what Garza was doing and somehow that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:02:05.509" style="s2">came to your attention and you responded</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">with i would say of piercing and very</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.509" end="00:02:12.989" style="s2">very extraordinary naming of what g√ºrtel</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">was trying to do and it was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.989" end="00:02:19.170" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:19.170" style="s2">you that people were using Goethe and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.380" end="00:02:24.790" style="s2">you know just accommodating him to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">whatever trip they were doing and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.790" end="00:02:31.000" style="s2">that and in that process reducing them</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:33.250" style="s2">so that that&#39;s how we started we got to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.000" end="00:02:39.970" style="s2">know each other and and I and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:44.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve always appreciated that that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.970" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">of the way you show up in and around</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.440" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing because it really frames</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:56.880" style="s2">some of the things that I&#39;m doing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:59.380" style="s2">makes me make sure I mean I don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.880" end="00:03:03.130" style="s2">represent myself the way I&#39;d like to but</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.380" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">I want to make sure that I am trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.130" end="00:03:07.989" style="s2">be as real as I canon and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:11.950" style="s2">how we first bumped into each other just</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.989" end="00:03:15.310" style="s2">right I think stuff too I&#39;m vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.950" end="00:03:18.519" style="s2">remember that I i remember that i saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.310" end="00:03:22.750" style="s2">you announcing that you&#39;d do this goethe</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.519" end="00:03:26.109" style="s2">thing based on a book and i had read a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.750" end="00:03:30.489" style="s2">couple of years before a whole symposium</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.109" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">on Goethe&#39;s scientific method and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.489" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">brought that to your attention as a sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">of an adjunct to your material yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">I got into that I got interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">joined up it was fun yeah we learned a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">lot from it I mean I think some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:55.109" style="s2">you what I would say the insights that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:58.389" style="s2">received from the 18 months that I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.109" end="00:04:03.489" style="s2">doing the magellan courses that was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.389" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">big part of it was just this this aspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.489" end="00:04:12.489" style="s2">of staying as close to the phenomenon as</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">possible and yeah and yeah this and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.489" end="00:04:15.850" style="s2">material it turned out the couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:21.070" style="s2">chapters in the book that were good</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.850" end="00:04:23.169" style="s2">we&#39;re from were represented on those</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.070" end="00:04:25.060" style="s2">links given and then that the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.169" end="00:04:27.580" style="s2">the book wasn&#39;t quite as interesting as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">what you had offered so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.580" end="00:04:35.129" style="s2">to be really great and then you suffered</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:39.370" style="s2">with us magellan courses okay well I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.129" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">like the I liked what part of da markers</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.370" end="00:04:45.699" style="s2">saying that I could that I could attend</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t attend it all in tonight and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.699" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">then there was always look to her so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">anyway I&#39;m really pleased that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">wanted me to do this interview because</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:02.770" style="s2">it speaks of a trust that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:07.110" style="s2">necessarily have to exist because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.770" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">there&#39;s I sense there&#39;s this gulf and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.110" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">off the top of my head I cannot think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">anyone who is so thoroughly different</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:19.599" style="s2">from me than you are and this is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.810" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">we were born in substantially different</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.599" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">generations the regional culture is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:28.389" style="s2">shaped our perspective might as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">been oceans apart instead of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.389" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">thousand cross-country miles my hair is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">at least twice as long as your days</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:38.529" style="s2">maybe three times you like cute little</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:42.460" style="s2">Morgan horses and I like big ugly</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.529" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">mustangs and i will bet money that Myers</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.460" end="00:05:46.779" style="s2">Briggs says you&#39;re an introverted</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.740" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">intuitive type and I&#39;m an extroverted</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.779" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">sensory type you like I abstract</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:54.069" style="s2">concepts and putting up words on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.639" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">printed screen and I like stories and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.069" end="00:05:59.770" style="s2">hammering solid art out of hot steel</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">anyway that says that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.770" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">context of this of this interview and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">your invitation to me you wrote I want</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:13.449" style="s2">you to really grill me in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:15.339" style="s2">making it more real it&#39;s real to me but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.449" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">then I have a way of getting lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.339" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">theory and I read that line and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:27.190" style="s2">put it in perspective with that line</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">from send in the clowns me here of at</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.190" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">last with my feet on the ground and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">in midair so we have set this up as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:40.089" style="s2">collaboration on how to diminish that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:40.900" style="s2">space as as far as my perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.089" end="00:06:44.139" style="s2">goes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.900" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">what I would like to do and for me the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.139" end="00:06:52.389" style="s2">best way to start out is to review that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:56.110" style="s2">old clich√© stick about the singer or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.389" end="00:06:58.810" style="s2">song and in the first post I ever wrote</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.110" end="00:07:01.300" style="s2">on an internet forum i said i&#39;m here for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.810" end="00:07:04.389" style="s2">the singers and not two songs because</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.300" end="00:07:06.759" style="s2">songs just come and go in this light i</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.389" end="00:07:09.900" style="s2">want to contextualize this interview</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.759" end="00:07:13.539" style="s2">with a brief focus on you the singer I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.900" end="00:07:15.789" style="s2">want to find out about a few defining</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.539" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">moments of your life and how they put</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.789" end="00:07:25.510" style="s2">you here not just what you thought but</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:31.000" style="s2">what you did to define yourself if I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:34.300" style="s2">just ask you your most defining self</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.000" end="00:07:39.009" style="s2">defining moment as a young adult and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.300" end="00:07:45.130" style="s2">adult any time since you know you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.009" end="00:07:48.789" style="s2">at least hat self-conscious what that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.130" end="00:07:51.250" style="s2">would be and I would like to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.789" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">talk about that for a few minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.250" end="00:08:00.460" style="s2">then we can get started reviewing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:08:02.860" style="s2">song yeah you know when I am going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.460" end="00:08:05.889" style="s2">tell the story but I I do want to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.860" end="00:08:09.880" style="s2">that I certainly experienced the story</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.889" end="00:08:12.669" style="s2">as you know it&#39;s easy to construct it</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.880" end="00:08:15.909" style="s2">looking back it certainly does not did</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.669" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">not feel this way going forward and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.909" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">someone asks a question like that then</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:25.810" style="s2">you tell a story in a kind of a succinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:30.820" style="s2">way so it makes a little more of a story</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.810" end="00:08:36.130" style="s2">about it and I just so so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.820" end="00:08:38.709" style="s2">start with that but if i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.130" end="00:08:42.580" style="s2">create those connect all those dots and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.709" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">have a thread that made the singer the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.580" end="00:08:46.870" style="s2">story of the singer and or maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">question is why does a singer sing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.870" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2">song as they do right George exam it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:58.329" style="s2">certainly starts very young</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.610" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">and when I was I asked my mom I said you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.329" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">know mom when was it that you taught me</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">how to pray you know you kneel and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">say now I lay me down to sleep and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:10.510" style="s2">sorry I yelled at my sister you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">this kind of thing and so she was able</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.510" end="00:09:25.240" style="s2">to to date that for me so I was about</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:29.010" style="s2">four years old and I had these I had two</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.240" end="00:09:32.950" style="s2">parts of my life I had a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.010" end="00:09:35.950" style="s2">kind of relationship with adults because</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.950" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">I always thought they were pretending</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.950" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">and I always thought that okay I&#39;m young</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">and they pretend until you get to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">certain age and then when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">certain age then they let you in right</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">they let you in and you have real</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:56.380" style="s2">conversations with them and I was kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:58.540" style="s2">of always trying to set well you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.380" end="00:10:00.730" style="s2">say to my parents look you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.540" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">I&#39;m young but I already know like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.730" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">pretending and that couldn&#39;t ever really</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">be bridged and as I got older um I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:18.060" style="s2">started to realize I was like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:18.060" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know they&#39;re pretending</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.149" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">so I was probably 11 or 12 and and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">was very strange thing to me so now I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:37.269" style="s2">have a more sophisticated understanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:39.820" style="s2">of that now in terms of the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.269" end="00:10:43.990" style="s2">it is to step out of roles and people do</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.820" end="00:10:45.850" style="s2">have some kind of in many cases sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">that they are pretending but can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.850" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">out of the roles and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">at that time it was just a big mind blow</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">now the other part of my life was I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">just so naturally intuitive in nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">and naturally good of the animals you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:06.060" style="s2">know even today there&#39;s people bring me</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">their little deer that they find and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.060" end="00:11:10.980" style="s2">bunny rabbits with three</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:14.940" style="s2">eggs and if I go out anywhere by myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.980" end="00:11:20.760" style="s2">especially on horseback a lot of animals</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.940" end="00:11:26.020" style="s2">up here in presents themselves and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.760" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">this was a a dichotomy really that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.020" end="00:11:36.990" style="s2">lived you know in terms of this yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:41.770" style="s2">terms of these two different types of of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.990" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">world that I lived in and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.770" end="00:11:53.010" style="s2">dichotomy also kind of became manifest</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:56.740" style="s2">in my personality because growing up I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.010" end="00:12:00.630" style="s2">was very physical I was very athletic I</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.740" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">was senior athlete of the year I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.630" end="00:12:12.010" style="s2">sexually ravenous um but then I was also</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:15.430" style="s2">very intellectual and able to remove</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.010" end="00:12:18.430" style="s2">myself and see patterns in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.430" end="00:12:20.470" style="s2">and see the cultural construction of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.430" end="00:12:23.500" style="s2">things even before I started to read</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.470" end="00:12:28.120" style="s2">things like that and so that became kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.500" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">of an interesting situation for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.120" end="00:12:33.280" style="s2">because for a while I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:35.650" style="s2">which one is really real you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.280" end="00:12:38.650" style="s2">fact that the intellect can see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.650" end="00:12:41.140" style="s2">physical manifestation made the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.650" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">intellect somehow seem more real you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.140" end="00:12:45.160" style="s2">hear me today saying don&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">intellect play the trump card it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">in the soup with everything else but at</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:53.080" style="s2">a time the way the intellect is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">structured because it becomes be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.080" end="00:13:00.550" style="s2">seer in our culture that makes it seem</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:13:04.330" style="s2">like it&#39;s more prior or something but</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.550" end="00:13:08.260" style="s2">the physical was more real right more</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.330" end="00:13:10.810" style="s2">grounded so this was kind of like what</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.260" end="00:13:15.580" style="s2">you asked me you know what was formative</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.810" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">in my adult young adult life and it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.580" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">just this in and and moving toward I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:28.360" style="s2">ever had anyone to talk about this was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.230" end="00:13:31.690" style="s2">journey I was on by myself I did not</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.360" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">read eclectic material I was a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.690" end="00:13:38.650" style="s2">scientist in postgraduate work but I had</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">this whole other campaign that I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.650" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">always doing since I was a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">and then I had a series of significant</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:52.050" style="s2">in sites where i could see clearly they</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:56.020" style="s2">were not two poles of something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.050" end="00:13:58.600" style="s2">then the dichotomy itself was socially</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.020" end="00:14:02.440" style="s2">or intellectually or cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.600" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">cognitively diskin structed so i start i</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.440" end="00:14:08.500" style="s2">spent 30 years reading philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">find someone who could articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.500" end="00:14:17.170" style="s2">and i realized that and it and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">couldn&#39;t like i&#39;d go into the chi gong</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.170" end="00:14:21.580" style="s2">community and see if it could get</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:23.710" style="s2">resolved there but they hadn&#39;t biased</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.580" end="00:14:26.860" style="s2">against intellectual you know so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.710" end="00:14:28.510" style="s2">was every community i went there was you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.860" end="00:14:30.250" style="s2">know and then i found will burn I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.510" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">thought Wilbur was going to name it but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.250" end="00:14:35.200" style="s2">then he ended up just resolving</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">everything into the two truths doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.200" end="00:14:46.180" style="s2">so so for me this this whole complete</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">experience of its like the cosmic joke</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.180" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">like the whole thing is just is just not</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:58.840" style="s2">a dichotomy and it&#39;s and it&#39;s so merely</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">the whole dichotomous nature of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.840" end="00:15:04.960" style="s2">everything is so clearly an elaboration</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:07.660" style="s2">on to for me what is real so that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.960" end="00:15:11.980" style="s2">think probably can&#39;t answer so much well</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.660" end="00:15:20.340" style="s2">yeah I think it did I appreciate it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.980" end="00:15:20.340" style="s2">lot the other context is that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.090" end="00:15:29.980" style="s2">can come out of the magellan course um</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:33.550" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.980" end="00:15:39.130" style="s2">and then get into you your new</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.550" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">enterprise you you&#39;re designing right</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.130" end="00:15:45.390" style="s2">now like you designed the Magellan</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">courses this upcoming symposium and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.390" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">hopefully more that will follow it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:59.290" style="s2">in your ITC paper you wrote and this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">about design to design this is a quote</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.290" end="00:16:05.830" style="s2">to design for emergent transformation</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:08.770" style="s2">requires designing from causal</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.830" end="00:16:10.870" style="s2">generative states of awareness this</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.770" end="00:16:13.870" style="s2">takes the form of what I call ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.870" end="00:16:17.080" style="s2">inquiry combined with a deep sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.870" end="00:16:20.650" style="s2">to what is latent latent and wants to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.080" end="00:16:23.520" style="s2">emerge a sensitivity which arises in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.650" end="00:16:26.860" style="s2">core spaces of one selves as</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.520" end="00:16:30.010" style="s2">universalize creative energy it is here</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.860" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2">in the fluid flow of causal energetic</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.010" end="00:16:36.820" style="s2">for fields generating fields and self</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.220" end="00:16:40.450" style="s2">other worlds as a rising interfaces that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.820" end="00:16:44.260" style="s2">the designer must live now what does all</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.450" end="00:16:47.200" style="s2">that mean what is ritualized inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.260" end="00:16:53.820" style="s2">okay so yeah let&#39;s start by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.200" end="00:16:53.820" style="s2">the small phrases ritualized inquiry is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.030" end="00:16:59.530" style="s2">well we&#39;re a more often involved this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.430" end="00:17:01.630" style="s2">a ritualized inquiry right so we set it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.530" end="00:17:03.700" style="s2">up and we have a conversation it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.630" end="00:17:10.960" style="s2">interview kind of situation a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.700" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">what we do is virtualized inquiry and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.960" end="00:17:18.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s not necessarily a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:22.180" style="s2">but when you design for ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.490" end="00:17:26.020" style="s2">inquiry then you&#39;re creating maybe new</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.180" end="00:17:29.170" style="s2">forms you know in the idea for me about</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.020" end="00:17:37.240" style="s2">ritualized inquiry is to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.170" end="00:17:40.450" style="s2">situation where people are as closely as</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.240" end="00:17:43.090" style="s2">possible experiencing something new for</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.450" end="00:17:43.960" style="s2">the first time you know it&#39;s I use the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:45.820" style="s2">horses like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.960" end="00:17:49.690" style="s2">the horses are great if people are not</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.820" end="00:17:52.600" style="s2">used to horses at all they go down we</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.690" end="00:17:54.309" style="s2">work with the horses then whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.600" end="00:17:56.590" style="s2">they&#39;re holding whatever they&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.309" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">on to whatever their their interest</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.590" end="00:18:00.940" style="s2">whatever is latent question in them you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:03.490" style="s2">know I&#39;ll talk about something wants to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.940" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">move I don&#39;t really say that to them but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.490" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">they come down and they interface with</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:10.630" style="s2">the horses so that&#39;s a way of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:12.039" style="s2">izing their inquiry instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.630" end="00:18:13.510" style="s2">saying okay well what do you think&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.039" end="00:18:17.289" style="s2">wrong with you you know what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:19.870" style="s2">all right right so like psychiatrist do</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.289" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">that right and and now we&#39;re too smart</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.870" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">for that right we lay on the couch and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:27.580" style="s2">which we already know what that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:31.539" style="s2">so it&#39;s no longer a ritual it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.580" end="00:18:33.490" style="s2">a received framework and so what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.539" end="00:18:43.390" style="s2">by ritualized inquiry something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.490" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">still sets up a situation that is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.390" end="00:18:50.020" style="s2">you that the intellect won&#39;t package is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:52.149" style="s2">a known or a given you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.020" end="00:18:54.730" style="s2">hard to do in our community everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.149" end="00:19:02.820" style="s2">done kind of everything so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.730" end="00:19:06.010" style="s2">that part and the sensitivity then is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.820" end="00:19:08.830" style="s2">the burden on the designer also has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">be sensitive to not to try to impose on</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.830" end="00:19:17.049" style="s2">this whatever you&#39;re doing their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:19.480" style="s2">knowing their own expectation of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.049" end="00:19:22.270" style="s2">going to happen but but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.480" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">hand I&#39;m trying to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.270" end="00:19:32.230" style="s2">there&#39;s some design in its oh so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">sensitive to something and you&#39;re it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.230" end="00:19:40.809" style="s2">tricky thing you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:49.080" style="s2">sensitive to something and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.809" end="00:19:52.090" style="s2">to keep this experience as close to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.080" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">new experience as possible so people can</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.090" end="00:19:57.510" style="s2">see it like when their children are they</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:20:00.030" style="s2">can experience it for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.510" end="00:20:03.450" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to play a role in that but</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.030" end="00:20:07.740" style="s2">you really can&#39;t you really have to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.450" end="00:20:09.180" style="s2">to avoid understanding that role in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.740" end="00:20:11.610" style="s2">own way because then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.180" end="00:20:14.210" style="s2">collapsing it into so to give you an</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.610" end="00:20:19.080" style="s2">example someone came and did one of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">horse workshops and it was they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.080" end="00:20:25.020" style="s2">only here for a half a day and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:26.700" style="s2">afterwards she said well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.020" end="00:20:28.530" style="s2">think this happened and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.700" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2">think that happened and I said well I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.530" end="00:20:33.330" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say to you what I think because</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">the whole reason for doing a horse</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.330" end="00:20:41.180" style="s2">workshop is to have that process in you</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:45.900" style="s2">in in kind of and to be sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.180" end="00:20:47.370" style="s2">whatever it is that&#39;s arising in you so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.900" end="00:20:50.700" style="s2">I can put the person in the horse</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.370" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">together in a certain way to better have</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.700" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">a better chance that that will happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:57.990" style="s2">but then I also have to keep my my you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">know I have a theory of why that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.990" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">happened and it&#39;s based upon my</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:05.010" style="s2">projection of who this person is and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:07.080" style="s2">know that&#39;s not my place to yourself out</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.010" end="00:21:09.000" style="s2">of that gotta keep it out of that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.080" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the place where the designer has</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.000" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">to live you know that&#39;s when that time</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:18.210" style="s2">kind of means they&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:26.520" style="s2">poetic actually the last line is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.210" end="00:21:29.340" style="s2">good yeah um I&#39;m going to think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.520" end="00:21:35.190" style="s2">that a little bit because I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.340" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">get back to it but but I&#39;m i have i have</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.190" end="00:21:49.080" style="s2">more clarity now yeah and now this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:52.370" style="s2">another foundational type of question in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.080" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">that same paper i came across this line</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.370" end="00:22:00.180" style="s2">that quote this is why the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">the magellan journey is so apt we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.180" end="00:22:05.970" style="s2">expect our usual navigation devices will</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:11.059" style="s2">give us useful answers now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.970" end="00:22:15.289" style="s2">know what are the usual navigation</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.059" end="00:22:20.029" style="s2">vices that you mean here and how are</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.289" end="00:22:22.309" style="s2">they going to fail us and maybe part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.029" end="00:22:26.659" style="s2">that question is what is your insight</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.309" end="00:22:29.749" style="s2">concept of an insight standing alone and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.659" end="00:22:31.610" style="s2">then a collective insight and how will</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.749" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">they save the day how do you think they</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.610" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">can become navigational devices yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:43.190" style="s2">first I want to de-emphasize save the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:47.029" style="s2">day and I know my campaign starts with</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.190" end="00:22:52.490" style="s2">this kind of really you know Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.029" end="00:22:55.389" style="s2">charge and stuff and I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.490" end="00:22:59.629" style="s2">interesting and fascinating and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.389" end="00:23:04.190" style="s2">useful but for me the major drive is fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.629" end="00:23:05.869" style="s2">you know so and and I hope it attracts</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.190" end="00:23:07.970" style="s2">people I think you can only be</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.869" end="00:23:10.909" style="s2">successful if you enjoy the process</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.970" end="00:23:14.539" style="s2">because I think that that saving the day</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.909" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">the world&#39;s going to Armageddon actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.539" end="00:23:20.690" style="s2">is one of these things that is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">obstacle toward insight and creativity</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.690" end="00:23:28.039" style="s2">so but I was right with ya but I do have</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:32.360" style="s2">this you know kind of Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.039" end="00:23:36.909" style="s2">beginning to my narrative there I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.360" end="00:23:39.320" style="s2">that what our usual navigation devices</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.909" end="00:23:41.570" style="s2">for me I mean they&#39;re they could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.320" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">different for other people I find that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.570" end="00:23:45.769" style="s2">these are not the case with some young</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:51.320" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve met recently you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.769" end="00:23:54.639" style="s2">think that that I or my age my mic up my</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.320" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">age my culture my generation have</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.639" end="00:24:02.749" style="s2">internalized some of this but usual</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:04.879" style="s2">navigation devices like um let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.749" end="00:24:16.610" style="s2">what some would be in good context here</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.879" end="00:24:19.730" style="s2">is that that well here&#39;s one that comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:21.830" style="s2">from the campaign that that when groups</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.730" end="00:24:23.480" style="s2">get together to work out problems that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.830" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be either in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.480" end="00:24:26.090" style="s2">debating comp</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:28.700" style="s2">titian we&#39;re going to look for consensus</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.090" end="00:24:31.059" style="s2">or we&#39;re going to compromise when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.700" end="00:24:33.499" style="s2">have difference alright so those</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.059" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">everybody&#39;s familiar with those nobody</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.499" end="00:24:38.629" style="s2">likes any of them so I&#39;m saying well we</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:41.929" style="s2">don&#39;t we&#39;re not interested in any of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.629" end="00:24:44.029" style="s2">them because I&#39;m interested or this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.929" end="00:24:47.749" style="s2">process is interested in something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.029" end="00:24:50.059" style="s2">we haven&#39;t considered before right so if</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.749" end="00:24:52.850" style="s2">you come together with a group and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.059" end="00:24:55.879" style="s2">say okay here we&#39;re not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.850" end="00:24:57.619" style="s2">we&#39;re going to work on a problem and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.879" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">know this is an experiment so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.619" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">going to use this course competitively</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:06.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no intellectual competition</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not interested in that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.860" end="00:25:12.679" style="s2">interested in consensus building and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.840" end="00:25:14.840" style="s2">we&#39;re not interested in compromise so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.679" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">let&#39;s work on this problem so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.840" end="00:25:19.220" style="s2">kind of taken away the most of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:21.019" style="s2">navigation devices and most and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.220" end="00:25:23.960" style="s2">happens when you when I&#39;ve done this in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.019" end="00:25:26.210" style="s2">in small groups is people start to laugh</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.960" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">because they realize they get stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.210" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">these patterns so some people are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:33.950" style="s2">trying to get consensus some people</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">can&#39;t help themselves but the hit their</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.950" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">pattern of debate comes over and over</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:40.940" style="s2">and over you and we start to laugh</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:44.440" style="s2">because we see the organism is just kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.940" end="00:25:47.990" style="s2">of stuck in patterns and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:51.320" style="s2">become very aware of these patterns for</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.990" end="00:25:53.179" style="s2">a while you kind of laugh because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.320" end="00:25:54.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know where to what you can stop</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.179" end="00:25:56.869" style="s2">them you get so you can interrupt them</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.889" end="00:26:01.669" style="s2">but you don&#39;t know what to put in their</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.869" end="00:26:04.249" style="s2">place and that&#39;s a transitional period</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.669" end="00:26:08.749" style="s2">because you&#39;re waiting for some some</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.249" end="00:26:10.999" style="s2">it&#39;s an e you know it&#39;s kind of like let</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.749" end="00:26:13.399" style="s2">me break in here right now because this</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.999" end="00:26:18.679" style="s2">relates to the next question I was going</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.399" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">to ask and you wrote in a PM to me about</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.679" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">dysfunctional group processes that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:29.119" style="s2">have experienced and quoting from your</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:32.149" style="s2">message says lots of dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.119" end="00:26:35.809" style="s2">dynamics structures that come up energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.149" end="00:26:37.309" style="s2">body patterns everywhere only some</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.809" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">people could see the patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.309" end="00:26:41.929" style="s2">release them into</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:43.880" style="s2">spontaneous creative thing other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.929" end="00:26:46.760" style="s2">are straining too hard to get some kind</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.760" end="00:26:51.950" style="s2">lots of problems with their energy body</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.010" end="00:26:55.580" style="s2">so this was interesting to me is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.950" end="00:26:57.409" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about well those are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.580" end="00:27:00.950" style="s2">I think a little more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.409" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">patterns right okay the one that I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.950" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">talked about you&#39;ll find in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.380" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">group prop you know board meetings I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:10.399" style="s2">been an organization or business</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:13.549" style="s2">meetings then you&#39;re going to bring in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.399" end="00:27:17.179" style="s2">spiritual community that this one was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.549" end="00:27:19.429" style="s2">particularly talking about and you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.179" end="00:27:22.419" style="s2">this another pattern and the pattern is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.429" end="00:27:25.370" style="s2">to feel some kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.419" end="00:27:28.460" style="s2">consciousness or mass consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.370" end="00:27:30.230" style="s2">you know I I said to the other day and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.460" end="00:27:31.909" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with you people you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.230" end="00:27:33.799" style="s2">know we just spent two thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.909" end="00:27:36.529" style="s2">deconstructing the ego in Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.799" end="00:27:39.950" style="s2">philosophy and now we have the super we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.529" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">collective being we face thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.950" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">and I said we&#39;re going to just spend the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.309" style="s2">rest of you know another 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:48.409" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to deconstruct that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.309" end="00:27:51.320" style="s2">that to me that the product of the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.409" end="00:27:54.370" style="s2">pattern so now we can look at that as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.320" end="00:27:58.519" style="s2">pattern itself and this whole week base</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.370" end="00:28:01.659" style="s2">interbeing now I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.519" end="00:28:05.630" style="s2">interesting going on in those processes</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.659" end="00:28:07.519" style="s2">but I would for me in my work I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.630" end="00:28:09.710" style="s2">use that incorporate it and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.519" end="00:28:12.740" style="s2">make distinctions because I don&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.710" end="00:28:16.610" style="s2">not what I&#39;m interested in let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.740" end="00:28:18.470" style="s2">I actually think that that that some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.610" end="00:28:19.580" style="s2">that work is problematic if people</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.470" end="00:28:24.500" style="s2">aren&#39;t making the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.580" end="00:28:26.750" style="s2">distinctions um okay what&#39;s an energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.500" end="00:28:29.480" style="s2">body you talk about energy bodies a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.750" end="00:28:32.149" style="s2">couple of times in this message yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.480" end="00:28:37.130" style="s2">again it&#39;s not nothing that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.149" end="00:28:38.690" style="s2">mystical there are unsure when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.130" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">had the experience of there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.690" end="00:28:44.510" style="s2">people you walk into the room and I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:47.000" style="s2">use an emotional term you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.510" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">just eggs up there so full with anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.000" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">and they&#39;re running off the wall and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:55.170" style="s2">stuff like but I don&#39;t need to use annum</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">words I just that it&#39;s just the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.170" end="00:28:59.940" style="s2">their energy you know they&#39;re like and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:03.720" style="s2">then there&#39;s other people that you walk</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.940" end="00:29:06.870" style="s2">in there like those room ionizers there</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.720" end="00:29:09.030" style="s2">they&#39;re so grounded and they&#39;re open in</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.870" end="00:29:13.950" style="s2">their eyes are open and that the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.030" end="00:29:17.820" style="s2">they you know there&#39;s a whole other kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.950" end="00:29:20.760" style="s2">of it it&#39;s automatic you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.820" end="00:29:23.820" style="s2">everybody&#39;s can feel it you know so some</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.760" end="00:29:26.580" style="s2">people are just like that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.820" end="00:29:30.900" style="s2">presence yeah their presence the energy</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.580" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">is a basic energy makeup and and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.900" end="00:29:40.110" style="s2">that&#39;s it okay um now on your collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:45.000" style="s2">in sight post on your insight blog and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.110" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">you also copied this over to your</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.000" end="00:29:53.270" style="s2">campaign literature you describe what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:56.309" style="s2">know and I think that that&#39;s you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.270" end="00:29:58.890" style="s2">people that you have worked with I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.309" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">imagine yeah you describe that what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.890" end="00:30:07.500" style="s2">know about collective insights but but</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.760" end="00:30:11.250" style="s2">the i found that paragraph incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.500" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">general and theoretical it was um not</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.250" end="00:30:19.980" style="s2">nailed down and it didn&#39;t tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:23.880" style="s2">or say how it was that you knew what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.980" end="00:30:27.420" style="s2">knew what you know yeah and you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.880" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">said we know this so did that no income</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.420" end="00:30:34.260" style="s2">from your experiences of someone else or</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:38.670" style="s2">were you know before did you get them</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.260" end="00:30:41.940" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to endanger any</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.670" end="00:30:45.000" style="s2">privacy of others anything no and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.940" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">actually yes you know you&#39;re so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.000" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">so i want to say this word that i type</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:58.290" style="s2">out but i don&#39;t know so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:31:00.270" style="s2">good pick up on your part writing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.290" end="00:31:02.030" style="s2">text for the symposium is a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.270" end="00:31:04.380" style="s2">difficult because it doesn&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.030" end="00:31:05.799" style="s2">the view of all the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.380" end="00:31:10.690" style="s2">participating in the sub</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.799" end="00:31:13.779" style="s2">iam and so it is kind of like not that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.690" end="00:31:16.299" style="s2">precise and not nailed down because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.779" end="00:31:18.549" style="s2">whole point of the symposium is to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.299" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">these many different traditions that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.549" end="00:31:26.860" style="s2">not experientially aware of and put</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.450" end="00:31:30.309" style="s2">ourselves together and see if there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.860" end="00:31:32.739" style="s2">some phenomenon or our principles like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.309" end="00:31:36.580" style="s2">guardian science just to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.739" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">very direct you know very directly I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.580" end="00:31:40.809" style="s2">know some of these most of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:42.879" style="s2">people&#39;s work and I&#39;ve seen them</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.809" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">presented conferences but that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.879" end="00:31:51.850" style="s2">haven&#39;t all any of us sat down together</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:54.429" style="s2">and done this work so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.850" end="00:31:57.639" style="s2">hoping to do in the symposium is to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.429" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">able to speak in much you know safe this</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.639" end="00:32:02.259" style="s2">is an experiment this is research this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:08.590" style="s2">is what I know and this is what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.259" end="00:32:13.899" style="s2">like so but when i use the we term that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.590" end="00:32:17.259" style="s2">is generally i&#39;m talking about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.899" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">of people who were at the third magellan</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.259" end="00:32:24.239" style="s2">retreat who stayed to and we had some</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:30.220" style="s2">significant insights about group process</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.239" end="00:32:33.309" style="s2">and we started to really develop some</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.220" end="00:32:35.619" style="s2">questions around this inquiry and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.309" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">that represents a little bit about like</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.619" end="00:32:41.980" style="s2">tentatively we&#39;re at this point we know</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">these things but because it needs more</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.980" end="00:32:50.289" style="s2">research that&#39;s why we ended up wanting</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:54.850" style="s2">to do the symposium and I see in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.289" end="00:33:02.619" style="s2">paper you also wrote that collective</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.850" end="00:33:04.419" style="s2">insights are rare in groups and mariya</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.619" end="00:33:10.330" style="s2">bek is how you pronounce your last name</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.419" end="00:33:13.029" style="s2">yes wrote in a comment I agree it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.330" end="00:33:15.460" style="s2">still rare it doesn&#39;t happen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.029" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">times in groups but somehow it is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.460" end="00:33:19.180" style="s2">special to me probably because it feels</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:21.640" style="s2">so natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.180" end="00:33:24.670" style="s2">you were experiencing it it is just of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.640" end="00:33:28.980" style="s2">life so in that regard it isn&#39;t special</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.670" end="00:33:33.850" style="s2">um what what&#39;s your reaction to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.980" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">yeah this is this is why I&#39;m fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.850" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">with this it&#39;s one of these subtractive</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:43.150" style="s2">additive things and that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.220" style="s2">writing about recently there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.150" end="00:33:47.380" style="s2">an aspect i recited as a class or the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.220" end="00:33:49.870" style="s2">other day and he was saying well you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.380" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s just so much fun like if if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.870" end="00:33:54.610" style="s2">you are with people and you&#39;re really in</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:57.450" style="s2">resonance and you&#39;re really thinking up</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.610" end="00:34:00.100" style="s2">what happens is collective insight</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.450" end="00:34:03.040" style="s2">collective insight when two kids are</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.100" end="00:34:06.310" style="s2">like that Roy Orbison traveling Wilbury</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.040" end="00:34:08.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a three right is that rare well</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.310" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">yet that level of skill it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.440" end="00:34:13.660" style="s2">rare but there is something that I agree</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">with you if it seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">natural now you can take a historical or</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:22.600" style="s2">evolutionary or anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:27.490" style="s2">perspective and in that case I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.600" end="00:34:30.040" style="s2">think that it is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.490" end="00:34:34.290" style="s2">early man could do this right because</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.040" end="00:34:39.340" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.290" end="00:34:41.920" style="s2">reason for that but but certainly people</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.340" end="00:34:43.450" style="s2">who are artists people who young kids</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.920" end="00:34:45.820" style="s2">when you&#39;re laying on your back and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.450" end="00:34:48.430" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at clouds and someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.820" end="00:34:50.740" style="s2">says oh look there&#39;s a panda over there</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.430" end="00:34:53.500" style="s2">and the other person is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.740" end="00:34:55.900" style="s2">searching around and then they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.500" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">see it but then they say something this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.900" end="00:35:01.510" style="s2">is very similar to a process a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:03.340" style="s2">collective insight right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.510" end="00:35:06.040" style="s2">there is something very natural out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.340" end="00:35:07.990" style="s2">problem so that&#39;s the subtractive</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.040" end="00:35:11.380" style="s2">argument that you have to take away</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.990" end="00:35:14.860" style="s2">these problems and these obstacles we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.380" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">learned to get back to it the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.860" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">is what is what is what has to be added</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:27.640" style="s2">to do collective insight at the level</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:31.330" style="s2">that adults are trying to work together</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.640" end="00:35:32.860" style="s2">is it merely a subtraction process so</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.330" end="00:35:35.550" style="s2">Terry o&#39;fallon ins and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.860" end="00:35:40.450" style="s2">you know Ramirez are coming they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.550" end="00:35:42.360" style="s2">arguably the most work in higher stages</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.450" end="00:35:45.340" style="s2">of cognition and states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.360" end="00:35:49.450" style="s2">they would have an additive argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.340" end="00:35:50.980" style="s2">right so we&#39;ve got some so this is you</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.450" end="00:35:52.780" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to keep course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.980" end="00:35:56.410" style="s2">plugging this imposing but this is like</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.780" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">for me I&#39;m really excited about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.410" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">symposium because this is going to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:06.520" style="s2">processed these this this question and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:09.460" style="s2">and because I have this kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.520" end="00:36:12.610" style="s2">thinking mind and then I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.460" end="00:36:15.490" style="s2">these this is all part of the soup that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.610" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2">is fascinating to me I find it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.490" end="00:36:25.180" style="s2">surprising that you would think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:27.850" style="s2">early man and would not know would not</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.180" end="00:36:32.860" style="s2">be able to practice this or it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.850" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">happen I would think it would be just</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.860" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">the opposite i think having experienced</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:46.690" style="s2">these collective insight moments in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:53.950" style="s2">own my own life they seem instinctual</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.690" end="00:36:57.600" style="s2">they seem like you know by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.950" end="00:37:04.600" style="s2">your horses that they&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.600" end="00:37:06.820" style="s2">without communicating right yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.600" end="00:37:10.270" style="s2">it&#39;s is that an instinctual thing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.820" end="00:37:13.870" style="s2">they&#39;re all in the same place well I I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.270" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">think that what I suspect but this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.870" end="00:37:21.570" style="s2">again what what my intention is in doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.650" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">the these experiment is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.570" end="00:37:27.910" style="s2">there&#39;s you know it&#39;s a seamless</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.780" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">progression so to me there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:33.550" style="s2">evolutionary component which I call</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:35.050" style="s2">effective resonance and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.550" end="00:37:37.230" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about with the horses you</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.050" end="00:37:41.110" style="s2">get down to where you&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.230" end="00:37:43.630" style="s2">feeling and energy content and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.110" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">not a separate sense of separation and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.630" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">and your kind of working with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s essential component</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:54.540" style="s2">of of some of this work then you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:57.880" style="s2">the next step up is early man</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.540" end="00:38:01.330" style="s2">anthropology of like tribal affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.880" end="00:38:04.810" style="s2">and the reason why and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.330" end="00:38:09.970" style="s2">the forms that took then I would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.810" end="00:38:14.190" style="s2">that they relied heavily on community</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.970" end="00:38:19.930" style="s2">specific practice and the development of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.190" end="00:38:21.849" style="s2">of of hierarchical leadership over time</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.930" end="00:38:25.810" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.849" end="00:38:28.359" style="s2">that not that this didn&#39;t happen before</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.810" end="00:38:31.330" style="s2">but it&#39;s really only emerging as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.359" end="00:38:33.099" style="s2">substantial capacity now because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.330" end="00:38:35.380" style="s2">read the anthropological record in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.099" end="00:38:38.020" style="s2">same way but there&#39;s something at each</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.380" end="00:38:42.330" style="s2">stage all the way from the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.020" end="00:38:44.650" style="s2">mammalian bonding that is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.330" end="00:38:47.590" style="s2">aspect of this so that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.650" end="00:38:52.390" style="s2">additive argument but as I said there</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.590" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">this is part of the inquiry hmmm yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.390" end="00:38:59.530" style="s2">would i would think it has something to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:39:03.970" style="s2">do with basic brain chemistry haha to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.530" end="00:39:06.790" style="s2">that&#39;s Alex L but yeah but and I never</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.970" end="00:39:10.690" style="s2">looked at it might I just thought oh its</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.790" end="00:39:14.650" style="s2">just oh this is pretty rare and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.690" end="00:39:20.200" style="s2">pretty big anyway RIA continues on her</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.650" end="00:39:22.349" style="s2">comment and she says one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.200" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">would like to stress again and again</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.349" end="00:39:27.970" style="s2">collective insight will only happen when</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:30.550" style="s2">the participants can spend all the not</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.970" end="00:39:35.109" style="s2">knowing and related discomfort because</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.550" end="00:39:38.380" style="s2">the inquiry they are in the guiding</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.109" end="00:39:44.099" style="s2">question has enough relevance for them</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.380" end="00:39:44.099" style="s2">that they are willing to sit it through</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.270" end="00:39:55.810" style="s2">has this been your experience also this</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.609" end="00:39:58.089" style="s2">is a little bit this is part of the gap</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.810" end="00:39:59.330" style="s2">between my experience Andrea&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.089" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">experience so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.330" end="00:40:05.660" style="s2">what I can point is that at the stage we</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.180" end="00:40:10.730" style="s2">are at now it is uncomfortable for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.660" end="00:40:12.860" style="s2">most part to do this work and and so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.730" end="00:40:15.260" style="s2">asked a little before about structures</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.860" end="00:40:16.730" style="s2">that come up so I&#39;ve been in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.260" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2">for example where we&#39;re sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.730" end="00:40:22.700" style="s2">did an experiment we&#39;re sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.700" end="00:40:26.050" style="s2">about 18 people and there are no rules</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.700" end="00:40:28.340" style="s2">we say okay we&#39;re going to not have what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.050" end="00:40:30.920" style="s2">reacquaint it we&#39;re not going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.340" end="00:40:32.900" style="s2">theme when that we&#39;re going to see if a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.920" end="00:40:36.620" style="s2">theme comes up we&#39;re not going to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.900" end="00:40:38.750" style="s2">any rules we could make rules up if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.620" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">want we&#39;re just going to start with</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.750" end="00:40:50.810" style="s2">nothing and so what happens is that full</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:53.840" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like like I&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.810" end="00:40:55.640" style="s2">little example of how I experience this</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.840" end="00:40:58.370" style="s2">happening instead of pointing out what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.640" end="00:41:00.620" style="s2">saw thought I saw on other people so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.370" end="00:41:02.150" style="s2">while sitting there and you know I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.620" end="00:41:03.710" style="s2">to make sure that we&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:06.830" style="s2">into some kind of spiritual mass</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.710" end="00:41:09.380" style="s2">consciousness so i feel myself without</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.830" end="00:41:11.630" style="s2">anything happening I can feel myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.380" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">pushing against that but that does not</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.630" end="00:41:16.130" style="s2">have that had risen yet and then I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.320" style="s2">remember at one point everyone was being</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.130" end="00:41:22.580" style="s2">really quiet and I got up to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.320" end="00:41:24.440" style="s2">bathroom and I felt like I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.580" end="00:41:26.810" style="s2">what I did when I was in fourth grade</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.440" end="00:41:28.700" style="s2">like do what you know like I should have</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.810" end="00:41:31.130" style="s2">asked permission and so you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.700" end="00:41:35.840" style="s2">these little structures arise in you and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.130" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">and if you over react you get itself I</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.840" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">think that&#39;s that was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:41.240" style="s2">happening to people that like these</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:44.540" style="s2">structures were rising and then they</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.240" end="00:41:46.930" style="s2">were they were yelling at people but but</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.540" end="00:41:49.790" style="s2">there was nothing there they would just</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.930" end="00:41:53.630" style="s2">these people happen to be all people</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.790" end="00:41:54.980" style="s2">that you know like all don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.630" end="00:41:56.570" style="s2">they&#39;ve been pushing against structures</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.980" end="00:41:59.780" style="s2">so much that when you completely take</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.570" end="00:42:02.300" style="s2">them away then then the dynamics become</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.780" end="00:42:04.010" style="s2">dysfunctional because everyone&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.300" end="00:42:06.080" style="s2">still pushing against certain structures</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.010" end="00:42:11.830" style="s2">and they&#39;re not even there which is for</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.080" end="00:42:18.130" style="s2">me it was a fabulous way to witness some</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.830" end="00:42:20.350" style="s2">this and there was a couple of young</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.130" end="00:42:23.410" style="s2">people very young people in this well</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.350" end="00:42:27.990" style="s2">very young 20 30 year olds in this who</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.410" end="00:42:31.480" style="s2">were there because they in particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.990" end="00:42:33.460" style="s2">were part of the movement of enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.480" end="00:42:36.250" style="s2">people telling us what to do enough of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.460" end="00:42:38.050" style="s2">school enough of gurus and they came out</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.250" end="00:42:40.660" style="s2">of it thinking well maybe we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.050" end="00:42:44.590" style="s2">the capacity to live without gurus and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.660" end="00:42:46.660" style="s2">frameworks and structures because all</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.590" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">this stuff is internalized and this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.660" end="00:42:53.980" style="s2">where a lot of the discomfort comes from</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:55.510" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t necessarily for people</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.980" end="00:42:57.610" style="s2">who have done a lot of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.510" end="00:43:03.100" style="s2">practice you can start to feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.610" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">discomfort in your own organism but then</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.100" end="00:43:10.210" style="s2">you when you do this with groups then</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:13.710" style="s2">you magnify the discomfort times the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.210" end="00:43:17.950" style="s2">number of relational dynamics that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.710" end="00:43:20.320" style="s2">pushing on you so I tell you I i left</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.950" end="00:43:21.730" style="s2">that experiment thinking my god I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.320" end="00:43:24.120" style="s2">know how the Palestinians and the</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.120" end="00:43:29.110" style="s2">this was just a group of people who knew</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.620" end="00:43:33.490" style="s2">each other rather in a calm ratalie</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.110" end="00:43:35.860" style="s2">fashion and people were just it was like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.490" end="00:43:44.980" style="s2">feeding Christians to the Lions and some</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.860" end="00:43:46.750" style="s2">phases of the work hmm I just I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.980" end="00:43:49.690" style="s2">lost my train of thought because that uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.750" end="00:43:56.050" style="s2">took me in a different direction then I</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.690" end="00:44:00.850" style="s2">had anticipated going but but she but</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.050" end="00:44:03.190" style="s2">riaz common oh yes she so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.850" end="00:44:06.040" style="s2">survive this you need something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.190" end="00:44:09.550" style="s2">very important to the group right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.040" end="00:44:12.220" style="s2">and I brought that up the other day in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.550" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">in the forum where I said I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.220" end="00:44:20.320" style="s2">has be a a material impingement done on</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.500" end="00:44:22.620" style="s2">a group of people to get them to really</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.320" end="00:44:22.620" style="s2">collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.750" end="00:44:32.140" style="s2">and I take it that what you are when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.110" end="00:44:37.600" style="s2">talk about collaboration you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.140" end="00:44:40.870" style="s2">about collaborating to move in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.600" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">direction towards collective insight is</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.870" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">that correct yes okay and so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:57.220" style="s2">get it at some point how do you get a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:45:02.320" style="s2">group to focus on the common relevance</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.220" end="00:45:08.020" style="s2">that Rhea speaks about yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.320" end="00:45:11.230" style="s2">what it is is I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.020" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">relevant the meaning of the question has</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.230" end="00:45:20.460" style="s2">to be have more power than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:22.990" style="s2">discomfort of the path to get there okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.460" end="00:45:25.210" style="s2">unless unless you&#39;re doing an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.990" end="00:45:27.640" style="s2">like me where the discomfort itself is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.210" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">part of what I&#39;m interested in but for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.640" end="00:45:33.070" style="s2">if you&#39;re not if you&#39;re in the group</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:38.920" style="s2">process so there&#39;s two ways to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.070" end="00:45:41.650" style="s2">can either make sure you pick a theme</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.920" end="00:45:43.840" style="s2">that has such like like you&#39;re all going</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.650" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">to die if we don&#39;t figure this out like</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.840" end="00:45:49.420" style="s2">an Apollo 13 you know when Ed Harris is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">working with us right so that really</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.420" end="00:45:59.230" style="s2">gets that group to gel but you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:46:01.690" style="s2">also work on training people to not have</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.230" end="00:46:04.450" style="s2">the discomfort right or to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.690" end="00:46:06.670" style="s2">the discomfort and not have it have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.450" end="00:46:10.690" style="s2">impact that it has and I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.670" end="00:46:13.060" style="s2">very exciting to me because I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:16.630" style="s2">broaden the scope of this work so people</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.060" end="00:46:20.650" style="s2">could you know use it to learn in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.630" end="00:46:27.850" style="s2">classroom and and and really learn it to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.650" end="00:46:31.780" style="s2">be a fun thing right so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.850" end="00:46:34.420" style="s2">these these this is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.780" end="00:46:43.450" style="s2">very trainable and learnable</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.420" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">and yeah and I think that if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.450" end="00:46:48.760" style="s2">culture that introduced this early on as</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:51.940" style="s2">I mean we introduced competitive debate</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.760" end="00:46:54.130" style="s2">we introduced this is what kids learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.940" end="00:46:56.770" style="s2">they go to school and when there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.130" end="00:46:58.750" style="s2">different opinions one is right like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.770" end="00:47:01.660" style="s2">teachers and the others wrong so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.750" end="00:47:04.890" style="s2">they learn we&#39;re constantly reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.660" end="00:47:11.099" style="s2">a certain way for people to engage and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.890" end="00:47:13.900" style="s2">my point is is so we&#39;ve invented these</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.099" end="00:47:17.829" style="s2">capacities are constraints and we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.900" end="00:47:19.900" style="s2">introduce new ways that have different</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.829" end="00:47:24.630" style="s2">capacities and different strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.900" end="00:47:27.099" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re more useful right now so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.630" end="00:47:29.290" style="s2">that would be my hope is to be able</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.099" end="00:47:34.960" style="s2">through training is to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.290" end="00:47:41.589" style="s2">discomfort so maybe this maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.960" end="00:47:44.069" style="s2">leads into my next question and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.589" end="00:47:50.140" style="s2">going to use this idea of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.069" end="00:47:54.180" style="s2">moving towards the collective insight is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.140" end="00:47:57.339" style="s2">that you mentioned yesterday in your</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.180" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">facebook dialogue with mostly Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.339" end="00:48:04.210" style="s2">O&#39;Sullivan who asked you why you saw you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:06.910" style="s2">were designing something new in the in</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.210" end="00:48:11.400" style="s2">the field and you mentioned various</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.350" end="00:48:54.450" style="s2">as I read while preparing here was a</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.760" end="00:49:04.260" style="s2">it might even quote all of it one of the</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.260" end="00:49:09.990" style="s2">can bring to inside training it&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.810" style="s2">call deep phenomenology this is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.990" end="00:49:15.420" style="s2">practice of observing the subtle</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">by saying we learn we can learn to be</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:10.500" style="s2">are you first of all I would like you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.620" end="00:50:14.700" style="s2">bring that down a little closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.500" end="00:50:15.870" style="s2">crowd yeah and but does is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.700" end="00:50:18.900" style="s2">the thing of getting through the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.870" end="00:50:21.090" style="s2">discomfort yes it is part of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.900" end="00:50:22.710" style="s2">of getting through the discomfort so let</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.090" end="00:50:26.520" style="s2">me tell you what&#39;s exciting about what</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.710" end="00:50:29.610" style="s2">RIA does she you know Otto Sharma has</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.520" end="00:50:32.070" style="s2">done the you theory and it&#39;s had a big</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.610" end="00:50:34.860" style="s2">impact and what he does describe them to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.070" end="00:50:38.730" style="s2">you is talk about the different state or</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.860" end="00:50:42.270" style="s2">a different you know different ways the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.730" end="00:50:45.630" style="s2">person drops into unknowing and presence</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.270" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">and then comes back up and becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.630" end="00:50:52.890" style="s2">dialogic again she sees that groups go</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:55.350" style="s2">through a pattern so groups will like</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.890" end="00:50:57.450" style="s2">she&#39;s done 14 years of research and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.350" end="00:51:00.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a point at which she calls it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.450" end="00:51:04.980" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.270" end="00:51:07.140" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a phase called the not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.980" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">growing phase but I forget what it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.140" end="00:51:16.350" style="s2">but every group goes through all you</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:19.380" style="s2">know the same processes basically early</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.350" end="00:51:22.710" style="s2">on before they get to where they start</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.380" end="00:51:28.470" style="s2">to instead of processing discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.710" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">start to really kind of synergize and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.470" end="00:51:32.910" style="s2">she&#39;s been running around looking for</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:34.620" style="s2">groups that can get through you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.910" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">principles that can get through you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.620" end="00:51:46.080" style="s2">through the several levels faster right</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:47.790" style="s2">so she and there&#39;s something that helps</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.080" end="00:51:49.350" style="s2">the discomfort when you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.790" end="00:51:51.390" style="s2">because you just know you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.350" end="00:51:54.210" style="s2">have to go through this process is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.390" end="00:51:57.270" style="s2">similar to when I write when I write I</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.210" end="00:52:00.600" style="s2">write for maybe three or four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.270" end="00:52:04.140" style="s2">maybe 40 or 50 pages and I hate it I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.600" end="00:52:06.690" style="s2">don&#39;t like any of it but it and then all</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.140" end="00:52:09.360" style="s2">of a sudden I have some inspiration or</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.690" end="00:52:12.270" style="s2">insight it usually comes either when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.360" end="00:52:14.850" style="s2">shoveling manure or I wake up the next</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.270" end="00:52:16.710" style="s2">day and then it&#39;s all there and even</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.850" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">though it&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.710" end="00:52:23.190" style="s2">understandable what I want to say comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:26.070" style="s2">right up and and yet I know I have to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.190" end="00:52:28.500" style="s2">through this process of it&#39;s not like i</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.070" end="00:52:30.150" style="s2">can just do nothing for two weeks i have</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.500" end="00:52:32.820" style="s2">to go through this process of burning</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.150" end="00:52:36.560" style="s2">out the stuff taking out the garbage i</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.820" end="00:52:40.260" style="s2">call it right so in terms of deep</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.630" end="00:55:34.470" style="s2">you talk here in the last paragraph of</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.230" end="00:55:51.500" style="s2">also read on your blog under the heading</p>

<p begin="00:55:51.500" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">cosmology and there you write generative</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.750" end="00:56:19.890" style="s2">towards complexity now my question is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.970" end="00:56:22.110" style="s2">putting those two quotes together about</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.890" end="00:56:26.790" style="s2">achieving deeper and deeper levels of</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.790" end="00:56:34.890" style="s2">toward sympathy and resident of unity am</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.170" end="00:56:39.600" style="s2">I putting oranges in an apple basket no</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.890" end="00:56:44.430" style="s2">I think I am no so this is what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.600" end="00:56:46.730" style="s2">exciting to me okay okay and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.430" end="00:56:48.840" style="s2">look at what we see conventionally</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.730" end="00:56:51.480" style="s2">conventionally we see two people at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.840" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">negotiating table and they achieve</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.480" end="00:56:57.090" style="s2">agreement discursive Lee you know they</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:57:00.210" style="s2">write a contract the words all line up</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.090" end="00:57:02.820" style="s2">they can go to court with it but in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.210" end="00:57:04.680" style="s2">deeper levels effect levels they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.820" end="00:57:06.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t trust this cuz I this is why</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.680" end="00:57:09.890" style="s2">this is why you&#39;re saying all the nice</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.510" end="00:57:13.410" style="s2">things right so this is our conventional</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.890" end="00:57:17.310" style="s2">reality that we try to achieve unity at</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.410" end="00:57:20.970" style="s2">this level of discourse or signifiers or</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.310" end="00:57:24.990" style="s2">ideas or nations you know at this level</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.970" end="00:57:27.870" style="s2">where we should be looking where the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.990" end="00:57:31.020" style="s2">purpose of this as humans in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.870" end="00:57:32.820" style="s2">is to be unique and interface like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.020" end="00:57:34.470" style="s2">and I are with different people and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.820" end="00:57:37.410" style="s2">we&#39;re talking and we don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.470" end="00:57:39.210" style="s2">if we agree we&#39;re just looking at clouds</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.410" end="00:57:41.970" style="s2">and seeing different things</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.210" end="00:57:46.560" style="s2">but conventionally we want agreement up</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.970" end="00:57:49.410" style="s2">there right right add more disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.560" end="00:57:51.270" style="s2">we you know from like this thing you</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.410" end="00:57:53.940" style="s2">started off really nicely today saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.270" end="00:57:57.020" style="s2">there&#39;s this trust there right so if</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.940" end="00:58:01.290" style="s2">you&#39;re connected where we are naturally</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.020" end="00:58:03.180" style="s2">in Union you know from because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.290" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">mammals at one level and then because</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.180" end="00:58:13.140" style="s2">we&#39;re you know then the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:17.099" style="s2">creativity that can be maintained if the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.140" end="00:58:19.380" style="s2">more recently evolve levels of in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.099" end="00:58:21.930" style="s2">creative imaginaries and conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.380" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">frameworks and with solving you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.930" end="00:58:26.790" style="s2">these discursive problems that can</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:29.609" style="s2">actually be much more creative so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.790" end="00:58:33.540" style="s2">my my guess and that&#39;s how the two of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.609" end="00:58:35.430" style="s2">them put together because we don&#39;t we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.540" end="00:58:37.109" style="s2">allowed ourselves to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.430" end="00:58:38.910" style="s2">disconnected at the levels you were</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.109" end="00:58:44.970" style="s2">talking early that early man is</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.910" end="00:58:48.780" style="s2">connected and we have replaced that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.970" end="00:58:53.369" style="s2">group dynamics with rules and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.780" end="00:58:56.670" style="s2">regulations and an implicit peer</p>

<p begin="00:59:03.619" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">so we&#39;ve kind of got it backwards it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.150" end="00:59:12.260" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the cart and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:15.060" style="s2">reason why we&#39;re always trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.260" end="00:59:18.030" style="s2">everybody wants to have the same belief</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.060" end="00:59:19.740" style="s2">or you know neo global capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.030" end="00:59:22.619" style="s2">because we&#39;re actually are now</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.740" end="00:59:26.040" style="s2">disconnected at that part we don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.619" end="00:59:29.010" style="s2">that we&#39;ve come from unity so we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.010" end="00:59:36.060" style="s2">us and this was it insight that when I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.910" end="00:59:40.140" style="s2">say we that a few of us had after this</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.060" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">very very long experiment over three</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.140" end="00:59:47.700" style="s2">days is that fundamentally this whole</p>

<p begin="01:00:01.180" end="01:00:08.950" style="s2">is it liberates us to be wildly diverse</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.680" end="01:01:26.020" style="s2">people to talk about what they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.140" end="01:01:29.110" style="s2">know instead of just sharing what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.020" end="01:01:33.520" style="s2">already know could you explain that some</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.110" end="01:01:36.730" style="s2">more yeah and of course this is not the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.520" end="01:01:41.290" style="s2">rules of this interview because all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.730" end="01:01:44.620" style="s2">doing is talking about what I know just</p>

<p begin="01:02:13.960" end="01:02:19.990" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing it to the thing so</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.110" end="01:02:22.930" style="s2">something will change right so that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.990" end="01:02:25.060" style="s2">you partake of something that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.930" end="01:02:27.100" style="s2">have when you walked in and to me this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.060" end="01:02:29.800" style="s2">is a good metaphor for what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.100" end="01:02:31.150" style="s2">Collective insight process is of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.800" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">we&#39;re all going to sit together in</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.150" end="01:02:35.920" style="s2">November and come with our own knowing</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:37.750" style="s2">this one&#39;s done 14 years of research</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.920" end="01:02:39.850" style="s2">that&#39;s really fascinating this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.750" end="01:02:41.800" style="s2">done eight years with cognitive studies</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.850" end="01:02:43.300" style="s2">sentence completion touch this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.800" end="01:02:45.550" style="s2">done this this one&#39;s done that so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.300" end="01:02:49.390" style="s2">got to start somewhere right but your</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.550" end="01:02:51.910" style="s2">relationship to that is like okay so</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.390" end="01:02:54.970" style="s2">throw it in there we&#39;re not interested</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:57.610" style="s2">in leaving with any of that I&#39;m not you</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.970" end="01:02:59.500" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want you to leave with what</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.610" end="01:03:01.330" style="s2">I know that&#39;s not the purpose and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.500" end="01:03:03.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just receive what you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.330" end="01:03:07.240" style="s2">and leave right that might be part of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.640" end="01:03:11.460" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking for is something that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.240" end="01:03:15.010" style="s2">no one brought in and if it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.460" end="01:03:19.270" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like the ability</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.010" end="01:03:21.940" style="s2">to see in that you know if you read my</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.270" end="01:03:25.120" style="s2">work on ontological have to use your</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.940" end="01:03:30.270" style="s2">mind you have to use your mind is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.120" end="01:03:32.770" style="s2">faculty for creative imagination and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.270" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">so in that process if people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.770" end="01:03:38.230" style="s2">cooperating and doing it right quote</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:39.970" style="s2">unquote ideas are running out and some</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.230" end="01:03:41.410" style="s2">of them are ludicrous and some of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.970" end="01:03:44.170" style="s2">are interested and then every once and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.410" end="01:03:46.690" style="s2">well someone says that one wait what did</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.170" end="01:03:48.100" style="s2">you say there and then somebody up you</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.690" end="01:03:50.710" style="s2">know and then all of a sudden and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.100" end="01:03:52.600" style="s2">yeah nah I made a mistake and then you</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.710" end="01:03:59.760" style="s2">go through again but it&#39;s this it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.600" end="01:04:03.340" style="s2">very very naive spontaneous can be fun</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">process but if you don&#39;t if your</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.340" end="01:04:13.930" style="s2">relationship to your own knowing is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">a commodity or or you have to win or I</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.930" end="01:04:18.580" style="s2">need to contextualize everyone in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:19.330" style="s2">relationship to me then you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.580" end="01:04:21.250" style="s2">can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.330" end="01:04:22.990" style="s2">to work you can pretend but you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.250" end="01:04:30.790" style="s2">to get this going to be way too much</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.990" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">just comfort right right i can i can</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.790" end="01:04:36.010" style="s2">understand that that what what you were</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:41.290" style="s2">doing in this collective inside thing is</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.010" end="01:04:48.040" style="s2">trying to come to the place that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.290" end="01:04:51.940" style="s2">group can have something new just the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.040" end="01:04:54.040" style="s2">same way that you and I come up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.940" end="01:04:56.290" style="s2">something new after sleeping on a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.040" end="01:04:58.900" style="s2">question all night long or something</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.290" end="01:05:03.910" style="s2">like that do it is that correct yeah or</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.900" end="01:05:08.410" style="s2">the d and i think that like I guess you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.910" end="01:05:11.350" style="s2">know we can we see it in sports we see</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.410" end="01:05:14.170" style="s2">it in like that video the Traveling</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.350" end="01:05:15.700" style="s2">Wilburys we experienced it in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.170" end="01:05:17.470" style="s2">magellan course for example when we were</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.700" end="01:05:19.900" style="s2">trying to come up with the logo you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.470" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">that graphic and where it started off</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.900" end="01:05:25.090" style="s2">with my little thing was so conservative</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.920" style="s2">and then it went way out and then it</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.090" end="01:05:30.430" style="s2">went and then we ended up with something</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.920" end="01:05:33.430" style="s2">cool you know and that process is just</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.430" end="01:05:37.900" style="s2">it&#39;s really fun when it when it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.430" end="01:05:39.700" style="s2">it&#39;s just fun and when you&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.900" end="01:05:43.330" style="s2">in that process if you&#39;re being honest</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.700" end="01:05:48.190" style="s2">yep this everyone says wow I could have</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.330" end="01:05:50.500" style="s2">never come up with that now we have more</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.190" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">difficulty doing this with conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.500" end="01:05:58.870" style="s2">ideas and we have with the more innate</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:06:00.750" style="s2">are like music and like art right so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.870" end="01:06:02.770" style="s2">question so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.750" end="01:06:04.660" style="s2">definitely think it&#39;s a new capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.770" end="01:06:08.650" style="s2">something about the way we get caught up</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.660" end="01:06:11.500" style="s2">in signifiers and Signet words to us are</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.650" end="01:06:14.590" style="s2">too close to supposedly being the truth</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.500" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">and not something creative you see so if</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.590" end="01:06:22.080" style="s2">we can see language in this course in</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:25.980" style="s2">ideas as the same kind of creativity</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.080" end="01:06:28.900" style="s2">then we start to be able to use that in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.980" end="01:06:31.540" style="s2">that realm the same way we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.900" end="01:06:34.320" style="s2">been able to do it in other more innate</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.540" end="01:06:34.320" style="s2">arts</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.099" end="01:06:45.339" style="s2">okay um now I&#39;m going to get back to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:48.040" style="s2">ITC paper again and from all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.339" end="01:06:51.190" style="s2">material I&#39;ve read so far this is this</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.040" end="01:06:55.480" style="s2">kind of hizmet the crux of the matter</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.190" end="01:06:58.180" style="s2">it&#39;s quote if we can set out a rigorous</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.480" end="01:07:02.410" style="s2">set of principles for collective insight</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.180" end="01:07:05.980" style="s2">that is not values or worldview specific</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.410" end="01:07:09.070" style="s2">but is methodological in scope and pro</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.980" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">special in practice then we have the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.070" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">possibility of bringing collective</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:15.910" style="s2">insight training into a much larger</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:18.490" style="s2">context now am i right saying that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.910" end="01:07:21.130" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much them crux of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.490" end="01:07:25.180" style="s2">work here yeah that&#39;s a Crocs and it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.130" end="01:07:27.640" style="s2">an if right the hypothesis just</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.180" end="01:07:39.099" style="s2">emphasizing the experimental aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.640" end="01:07:41.170" style="s2">this and and so that&#39;s a pretty big s</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.099" end="01:07:43.810" style="s2">and I and we started off by talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.170" end="01:07:51.670" style="s2">about Guardian science I I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.810" end="01:07:53.800" style="s2">guardian science type of inquiry like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.670" end="01:07:55.660" style="s2">phenomenon you know I didn&#39;t use the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.800" end="01:07:58.359" style="s2">term or phenomenon that text but i</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.660" end="01:08:04.450" style="s2">wanted to because that&#39;s what it seems</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.359" end="01:08:11.079" style="s2">like to me that that would be what I</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.450" end="01:08:12.220" style="s2">would be interested in and I think other</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.079" end="01:08:16.569" style="s2">people are going to come to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.220" end="01:08:20.040" style="s2">symposium and and you know have other</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.569" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">kinds of insights that will be be</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.040" end="01:08:25.560" style="s2">equally valuable but this would be my</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.719" end="01:08:35.529" style="s2">you know I have my one kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.560" end="01:08:39.759" style="s2">examination of the process and so is is</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.529" end="01:08:43.890" style="s2">this is does this happen elsewhere and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.759" end="01:08:46.779" style="s2">and I think there are instances where</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.890" end="01:08:47.889" style="s2">you know certainly sports so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.779" end="01:08:50.109" style="s2">can say well that&#39;s never going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.889" end="01:08:55.480" style="s2">happen well there&#39;s principles in in</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.109" end="01:09:00.429" style="s2">sports let&#39;s say that can be very</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.480" end="01:09:02.770" style="s2">helpful in bridging that that are not</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.429" end="01:09:05.969" style="s2">value know it&#39;s very difficult because</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.770" end="01:09:07.869" style="s2">of course there&#39;s there&#39;s competition is</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.969" end="01:09:10.809" style="s2">different cultures and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.869" end="01:09:16.210" style="s2">but there&#39;s there are some kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.809" end="01:09:24.609" style="s2">things that certainly are more effective</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.210" end="01:09:26.650" style="s2">at nuk not not being that being more</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.609" end="01:09:34.929" style="s2">translatable across world views and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.650" end="01:09:39.880" style="s2">values so the idea is the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.929" end="01:09:42.819" style="s2">we have big needs or big problems or</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.880" end="01:09:45.489" style="s2">bring solutions or you know all the lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.819" end="01:09:51.279" style="s2">of the stuff that we do is very large in</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.489" end="01:10:00.130" style="s2">scale and requires a large collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.279" end="01:10:02.739" style="s2">and people get stuck because they have</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.130" end="01:10:08.590" style="s2">these ways of engaging that don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.739" end="01:10:12.809" style="s2">to carry forward the project and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.590" end="01:10:12.809" style="s2">translate across values and worldviews</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.500" end="01:10:19.690" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s a big hypothesis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.320" end="01:10:23.380" style="s2">avoiding trying to name it because I</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.690" end="01:10:26.829" style="s2">don&#39;t really know what those will be is</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.380" end="01:10:28.989" style="s2">always yeah that would be that would be</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.829" end="01:10:35.949" style="s2">my unknowing what I would bring is an</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.989" end="01:10:39.579" style="s2">unknowing yeah I understand that can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.949" end="01:10:49.329" style="s2">stop recording a second I sure hold on</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.579" end="01:10:53.289" style="s2">oh my last question at least for right</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.329" end="01:10:55.750" style="s2">now goes back to this dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.289" end="01:10:59.110" style="s2">dynamics that we&#39;d talked about in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.750" end="01:11:00.170" style="s2">previous question and he wrote to me</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.110" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.170" end="01:11:06.230" style="s2">that you suspected some of these</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:09.590" style="s2">dysfunctions will rise in future groups</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.230" end="01:11:12.440" style="s2">quote I suspect the same structures will</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.590" end="01:11:15.469" style="s2">arise perhaps we can look at them more</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.440" end="01:11:18.320" style="s2">directly so I would like this to involve</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.469" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">as many people from the magellan ship is</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.320" end="01:11:24.469" style="s2">possible to build a group that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:28.550" style="s2">look at such things that seem to impede</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.469" end="01:11:30.760" style="s2">what we can create imagine etc the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.550" end="01:11:34.310" style="s2">interpersonal dynamics provide a vehicle</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.760" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">the energy the enthusiasm but also the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.310" end="01:11:40.550" style="s2">interpersonal structures the assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:44.989" style="s2">expectations projections etc get in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.550" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">way can you talk more about the group</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.989" end="01:11:53.390" style="s2">that you just mentioned and sort of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:55.130" style="s2">a new phase of Magellan yeah and and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.390" end="01:12:00.010" style="s2">know I wanted to do this interview</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.130" end="01:12:03.620" style="s2">pretty specifically for the crew and</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.010" end="01:12:06.410" style="s2">also for people who have recently joined</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.620" end="01:12:10.429" style="s2">is not not anything formal going on at</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.410" end="01:12:12.469" style="s2">the Magellan courses right now so the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.429" end="01:12:17.179" style="s2">Magellan course is just a brief history</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.469" end="01:12:19.699" style="s2">started because I had a day job and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.179" end="01:12:21.830" style="s2">had eight weeks off lay off over the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.699" end="01:12:25.400" style="s2">winter because the economy is slow and</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.830" end="01:12:27.140" style="s2">we started it as a hobby and then it got</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.400" end="01:12:31.190" style="s2">more and more interesting and became</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.140" end="01:12:35.090" style="s2">more and more part of my career path or</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.190" end="01:12:37.820" style="s2">whatever you want to call it and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.090" end="01:12:41.660" style="s2">first phase of it was experiment in</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.820" end="01:12:47.980" style="s2">co-creative learning and what we did is</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.660" end="01:12:52.190" style="s2">we used text you know we read books as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.980" end="01:12:54.440" style="s2">central theme around which we could see</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.190" end="01:12:58.880" style="s2">how we could learn together without a</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.440" end="01:13:01.070" style="s2">lot of structure and it ended that</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:03.080" style="s2">experiment it ended in the series of</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.070" end="01:13:05.300" style="s2">retreats where what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.080" end="01:13:10.750" style="s2">about in terms of just putting people</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.300" end="01:13:15.670" style="s2">without a lot of structure together show</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.750" end="01:13:23.090" style="s2">elicited some of these these relational</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.670" end="01:13:25.330" style="s2">dynamics so what I was wanting to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.090" end="01:13:27.200" style="s2">after I came back from the ITC</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.330" end="01:13:31.010" style="s2">conference and people were pretty</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.200" end="01:13:32.600" style="s2">excited was get this group of people</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.010" end="01:13:35.990" style="s2">that wanted to work together but not</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.600" end="01:13:39.860" style="s2">just do the experiment amongst the 16 of</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.990" end="01:13:41.990" style="s2">us because this is part of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.860" end="01:13:44.570" style="s2">important to me this type of work is</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.990" end="01:13:48.560" style="s2">being been done in small community</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.570" end="01:13:51.590" style="s2">specific practices and it only will work</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.560" end="01:13:54.500" style="s2">in a larger group if you can include a</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.590" end="01:13:56.510" style="s2">much more diverse group of people now</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.500" end="01:13:59.180" style="s2">obviously people that are on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.510" end="01:14:00.740" style="s2">magellan course already selected somehow</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.180" end="01:14:02.510" style="s2">self-selected around certain</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.740" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">commonalities but it&#39;s certainly a much</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.510" end="01:14:09.440" style="s2">larger group as we know when we have</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:11.780" style="s2">seen some of the difficulties we have</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:14.660" style="s2">communicating so we know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.780" end="01:14:18.920" style="s2">diverse group so I want to include them</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.660" end="01:14:21.170" style="s2">I wanted to create something that we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.920" end="01:14:22.990" style="s2">carry this group forward that they might</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.170" end="01:14:26.900" style="s2">be interested in that was less</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.990" end="01:14:29.030" style="s2">intellectual because I know that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.900" end="01:14:31.460" style="s2">was a little bit of a limiting factor in</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.030" end="01:14:35.570" style="s2">terms of who and how we could</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.460" end="01:14:37.990" style="s2">participate and really went into more of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.570" end="01:14:39.890" style="s2">this experiment in co-creating</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.990" end="01:14:42.410" style="s2">collaborating i call it collective</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.890" end="01:14:45.530" style="s2">insight now and the way i thought we</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.410" end="01:14:48.490" style="s2">could do that was to have i have two</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.530" end="01:14:53.240" style="s2">people who are going to be live-blogging</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.490" end="01:14:55.010" style="s2">the four days of the symposium one is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.240" end="01:15:00.460" style="s2">going to be more of a journalistic style</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.010" end="01:15:02.630" style="s2">the other is a theoretician in online</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.460" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">interactions and so that will be more</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.630" end="01:15:07.940" style="s2">kind of a meta perspective so you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:11.000" style="s2">kind of like so we&#39;ll be live-blogging</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.940" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on with a group I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.000" end="01:15:15.470" style="s2">hoping that a significant portion of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:17.360" style="s2">magellan group would be interested this</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.470" end="01:15:20.060" style="s2">would be a new group it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.360" end="01:15:23.630" style="s2">private group for people are interested</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.060" end="01:15:27.980" style="s2">in playing around with this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.630" end="01:15:31.460" style="s2">collective insight and it would start</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.980" end="01:15:35.150" style="s2">being this group that was part of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.460" end="01:15:38.210" style="s2">blogging in some short video taping from</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.150" end="01:15:40.670" style="s2">the symposium itself and the point is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.210" end="01:15:44.000" style="s2">symposium is not there to answer all the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.670" end="01:15:52.840" style="s2">questions but to be the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.000" end="01:15:55.820" style="s2">next experiment and to both to generate</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.840" end="01:15:59.810" style="s2">revenue so that I can spend the next</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.820" end="01:16:01.400" style="s2">eight months working on this and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.810" end="01:16:03.560" style="s2">really commit to being able to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.400" end="01:16:07.550" style="s2">present in this inquiry if people want</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.560" end="01:16:10.160" style="s2">to join up then I have on the campaign</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.550" end="01:16:13.430" style="s2">for forty dollars you can be part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.160" end="01:16:17.650" style="s2">this group during the insight symposium</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.430" end="01:16:20.360" style="s2">and that will be the group that I hope</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.650" end="01:16:24.470" style="s2">becomes the new transformation of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.360" end="01:16:27.350" style="s2">we started in the magellan courses and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.470" end="01:16:30.350" style="s2">think that group will you know people</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.350" end="01:16:34.660" style="s2">who are interested in this experiment</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.350" end="01:16:37.790" style="s2">should move to that to that other</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.660" end="01:16:39.739" style="s2">private group well we look at some of</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.790" end="01:16:45.260" style="s2">these principles and hash out what goes</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.739" end="01:16:48.470" style="s2">on and yes and in in you know we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.260" end="01:16:52.070" style="s2">fun to it but of course we always have</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.470" end="01:16:54.080" style="s2">fun but that would be the you know that</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.070" end="01:16:56.720" style="s2">would be and i&#39;ll be writing i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.080" end="01:17:02.600" style="s2">going to write like some principles and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.720" end="01:17:05.150" style="s2">and yeah and we could we could look at</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.600" end="01:17:07.550" style="s2">my very theoretical way of saying things</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.150" end="01:17:10.910" style="s2">and try to bring it down to something</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.550" end="01:17:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s useful or just you know i</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.910" end="01:17:15.650" style="s2">discovered that the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.040" end="01:17:18.200" style="s2">seriously flawed and move on to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.650" end="01:17:23.510" style="s2">something else that&#39;s it all the same to</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.200" end="01:17:26.900" style="s2">me actually right exactly we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.510" end="01:17:31.070" style="s2">always want to be right no we&#39;re just oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.900" end="01:17:34.010" style="s2">yeah go ahead now I mean for me the fun</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.070" end="01:17:39.270" style="s2">part is moving beyond what you know you</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.010" end="01:17:42.630" style="s2">know um how do you write the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.270" end="01:17:46.280" style="s2">it was interesting and this is just a</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.630" end="01:17:52.340" style="s2">little bit for me and maybe you have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.280" end="01:17:56.160" style="s2">little more insight into this to the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.340" end="01:17:59.430" style="s2">traveling wilburys ape and that was put</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.160" end="01:18:02.970" style="s2">up on that on I don&#39;t know I got it</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.430" end="01:18:07.050" style="s2">either in my news reader Magellan course</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.970" end="01:18:14.870" style="s2">anyway I liked it because i like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.050" end="01:18:21.000" style="s2">traveling wilburys and that that group</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.870" end="01:18:24.830" style="s2">arose spontaneously um George Harris</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.000" end="01:18:27.300" style="s2">went to somebody and ask if there was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.830" end="01:18:29.160" style="s2">recording studio around and somebody</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.300" end="01:18:32.210" style="s2">else said I need to go get my guitar</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.160" end="01:18:36.510" style="s2">it&#39;s over it somebody else&#39;s place and</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.210" end="01:18:42.540" style="s2">it just all fell together and Tom Petty</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.510" end="01:18:46.010" style="s2">ended up in there Roy Orbison and some</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.540" end="01:18:54.920" style="s2">of some few of my favorite musicians and</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.010" end="01:18:54.920" style="s2">it reminded me of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.160" end="01:19:06.110" style="s2">spontaneous arising of something that</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.640" end="01:19:08.670" style="s2">maintains itself in that form years ago</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.110" end="01:19:12.090" style="s2">how it works and how it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.670" end="01:19:16.770" style="s2">this is a little parable on that years</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.090" end="01:19:19.530" style="s2">ago i dropped out of college to become</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.770" end="01:19:24.960" style="s2">the managing editor of a magazine that</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.530" end="01:19:28.290" style="s2">was national magazine and we operated on</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:33.300" style="s2">a collective basis it was kind of a new</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.290" end="01:19:37.310" style="s2">left some amazing pubs poem poetry came</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.300" end="01:19:44.970" style="s2">out of it some incredibly good art but</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.310" end="01:19:52.870" style="s2">the principle of collective insight was</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.970" end="01:19:59.470" style="s2">supposedly a goal and an assualt after</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.870" end="01:20:02.590" style="s2">our holy grail of this group because we</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.470" end="01:20:08.740" style="s2">were all there just to you know on no</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.590" end="01:20:13.480" style="s2">hierarchy no no one telling us what to</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.740" end="01:20:19.630" style="s2">do and so on and I was there for a year</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.480" end="01:20:22.410" style="s2">and despite everything we did all of our</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.630" end="01:20:27.420" style="s2">staff meetings our retreats etcetera</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.410" end="01:20:31.180" style="s2">never in that year were was there any</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.420" end="01:20:35.040" style="s2">collective insights generated now</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.180" end="01:20:44.070" style="s2">occasionally some people you know would</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.040" end="01:20:49.420" style="s2">think that we were all as one and moving</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.070" end="01:20:53.640" style="s2">on a collective insight but afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.420" end="01:20:58.150" style="s2">you found out that they had</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.640" end="01:21:04.480" style="s2">misinterpreted and that the group was</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.150" end="01:21:10.900" style="s2">just as chaos written as dumb as it</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.480" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">always had been now partially because of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.900" end="01:21:20.650" style="s2">that I left that magazine and went a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:26.170" style="s2">half a block away this was this is also</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.650" end="01:21:29.440" style="s2">in Nashville Tennessee went half a block</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.170" end="01:21:36.130" style="s2">away and got on the staff of another</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.440" end="01:21:45.300" style="s2">magazine and there was no intention in</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.130" end="01:21:53.110" style="s2">that group of the in that staff of doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.300" end="01:21:57.330" style="s2">collective insight but here we were we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.110" end="01:21:57.330" style="s2">were out of totally different</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.050" end="01:22:07.290" style="s2">backgrounds and so on just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.230" end="01:22:07.290" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.760" end="01:22:22.099" style="s2">pretty nihilistic prima donna journalist</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.749" end="01:22:22.099" style="s2">and the energy of that group of people</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.579" end="01:22:35.939" style="s2">was was truly generative and it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.860" end="01:22:37.949" style="s2">spontaneous and so so the traveling</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.939" end="01:22:41.459" style="s2">Wilbury thing reminded me a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.949" end="01:22:45.539" style="s2">them took me back to that and it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.459" end="01:22:54.380" style="s2">sustained and the energy and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.539" end="01:22:59.639" style="s2">generativity and the feeling of unity</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.380" end="01:23:02.280" style="s2">that was I don&#39;t know how it how it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.639" end="01:23:05.550" style="s2">generated I think it was maybe because</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.280" end="01:23:10.979" style="s2">we thought we were all prima no I</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.550" end="01:23:13.920" style="s2">respected each other yeah Dutch Santa</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.979" end="01:23:16.199" style="s2">mark go ahead no but this is how it</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.920" end="01:23:19.800" style="s2">works and this is why I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.199" end="01:23:21.900" style="s2">lot of confusion in some of the people</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.800" end="01:23:26.969" style="s2">around this it took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.900" end="01:23:30.150" style="s2">make sure of who was saying what but</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.969" end="01:23:33.869" style="s2">like that&#39;s how collective insight works</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.150" end="01:23:35.789" style="s2">you can&#39;t it&#39;s not over there if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.869" end="01:23:37.530" style="s2">make an object out of it like the wii</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.789" end="01:23:39.599" style="s2">space or you know we&#39;re all going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.530" end="01:23:43.139" style="s2">love each other or something you ruin it</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.599" end="01:23:46.739" style="s2">the put it becomes poison exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.139" end="01:23:49.050" style="s2">with my experience exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.739" end="01:23:51.719" style="s2">it&#39;s so you can&#39;t make an object out of</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.050" end="01:23:53.939" style="s2">it and that&#39;s like in my my video it</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.719" end="01:23:56.459" style="s2">says collective insight that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.939" end="01:23:59.639" style="s2">using this word if it claims the power</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.459" end="01:24:05.309" style="s2">the personal you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.639" end="01:24:06.959" style="s2">of trusting the commonality is already</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.309" end="01:24:09.090" style="s2">there you don&#39;t have to worry about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.959" end="01:24:12.209" style="s2">you have to be defensive about it and</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.090" end="01:24:16.019" style="s2">really be spontaneous and really be</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.209" end="01:24:19.200" style="s2">interested in curious you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.019" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">so and then the other thing is</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.200" end="01:24:23.820" style="s2">everybody can have an insight like the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.600" end="01:24:25.200" style="s2">energy so cool you&#39;d be like wow I know</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.820" end="01:24:27.870" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to do from to the next</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.200" end="01:24:29.250" style="s2">issue but the other person doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.870" end="01:24:31.260" style="s2">oh I know what I&#39;m going to do for the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.250" end="01:24:34.620" style="s2">next issue and you both write the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.260" end="01:24:36.930" style="s2">thing you both have insights right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.620" end="01:24:39.390" style="s2">generative of all this inciting is</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.930" end="01:24:41.910" style="s2">happening but you don&#39;t come up with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.390" end="01:24:43.770" style="s2">same thing if but everybody is not you</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.910" end="01:24:47.160" style="s2">know I mean not everybody is in complete</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.770" end="01:24:49.050" style="s2">synchronicity but but it&#39;s insightful</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.160" end="01:24:50.970" style="s2">for everyone it&#39;s not like one person</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.050" end="01:24:52.410" style="s2">goes home this is uh yeah I had a matter</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.970" end="01:24:56.520" style="s2">of perspective and now I know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.410" end="01:24:59.570" style="s2">going on and nobody else had it right so</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.520" end="01:25:04.470" style="s2">and then this is where people get</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.570" end="01:25:06.540" style="s2">frustrated because when you have the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.470" end="01:25:09.450" style="s2">group of goal for this phase where</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.540" end="01:25:10.980" style="s2">people like yeah yeah I know it I I know</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.450" end="01:25:13.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t need I know what you mean and</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.980" end="01:25:16.860" style="s2">then when they start to talk about well</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.410" end="01:25:19.050" style="s2">what do you think the diversity will</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.860" end="01:25:21.180" style="s2">come up again and people will feel like</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.050" end="01:25:23.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve been betrayed because how could</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.180" end="01:25:26.190" style="s2">they have this feeling that we were</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.040" end="01:25:27.630" style="s2">really like gelling and then somebody</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.190" end="01:25:30.210" style="s2">comes up with something different and</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.630" end="01:25:33.600" style="s2">this is a confusion right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.210" end="01:25:35.880" style="s2">this is the confusion of of what</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.600" end="01:25:37.920" style="s2">collective insight is so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.880" end="01:25:40.680" style="s2">good example of what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.920" end="01:25:43.620" style="s2">collective insight and versus what I</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.680" end="01:25:45.540" style="s2">call community specific practice that</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.620" end="01:25:47.970" style="s2">makes an object out of some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.540" end="01:25:53.960" style="s2">unification and that to me is false</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.970" end="01:25:57.180" style="s2">consciousness good good good point um</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.960" end="01:26:00.510" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t have anything more to</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.180" end="01:26:04.890" style="s2">right now yeah nothing to spend X you</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.510" end="01:26:08.300" style="s2">know just such a good interviewer thank</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.890" end="01:26:08.300" style="s2">you thank you very much</p>
