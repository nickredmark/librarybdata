<p begin="00:00:20.529" end="00:00:26.730" style="s2">last time we took a look at the nature</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.320" end="00:00:31.020" style="s2">of cognitive science and argued for</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:35.590" style="s2">synoptic integration that addresses</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.530" end="00:00:58.719" style="s2">I propose to you that we start doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.739" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">cognitive science in in two ways first</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:03.250" style="s2">of all just trying to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:08.590" style="s2">cognitive machinery that is responsible</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.590" end="00:01:15.700" style="s2">exemplify that pattern of bringing about</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.180" end="00:01:30.820" style="s2">profound constructs so we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.310" end="00:01:33.490" style="s2">the central capacity to be a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.820" end="00:01:34.990" style="s2">agent and this is your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.490" end="00:01:36.520" style="s2">intelligence and of course intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.990" end="00:01:38.080" style="s2">is something that neuro scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.520" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">looking for in the brain and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.080" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">artificial intelligence machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:48.220" style="s2">is trying to create they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.610" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">create intelligence psychology of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.220" end="00:01:52.329" style="s2">has famously been measuring intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:54.310" style="s2">since it&#39;s very inception the word</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.329" end="00:01:56.350" style="s2">intelligences has reading between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.310" end="00:02:00.310" style="s2">lines which seems we&#39;ll see has a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.350" end="00:02:02.740" style="s2">do with your use of language and etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.310" end="00:02:07.210" style="s2">culture of course seems to be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.740" end="00:02:08.920" style="s2">connected to the application and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.210" end="00:02:10.420" style="s2">development of intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.920" end="00:02:12.130" style="s2">intelligence is a great place to start</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.420" end="00:02:14.100" style="s2">and then I said we need to be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.130" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">careful we don&#39;t want to equivocate</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:21.190" style="s2">about intelligence we want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:24.700" style="s2">we we approach it very carefully because</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.190" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">although it is very important to us we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.700" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">often are using the term in an equivocal</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">and confused</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">and therefore bullshitting ourselves an</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">important way and then I propose to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">that we don&#39;t focus on the results the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">product of our intelligence our</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:44.960" style="s2">knowledge and what our knowledge does</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">for us our technologies for example we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.960" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">focus instead on the process that allows</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">us to acquire knowledge because that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">we have something we can use</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">intelligence to explain how we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">acquired the knowledge we have I then</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">propose to you to follow the work that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">was seminal both in the psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">measure of intelligence Binet and Simon</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">and the attempt to artificially generate</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">intelligence the work of New Orleans</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">Simon and this is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">intelligence is your capacity to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:22.380" style="s2">general problem solver to solve a wide</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">variety of problems across a wide</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.380" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">variety of domains and then in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">get clear about that we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">the work of New Orleans Simon trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">give us a very careful formal analysis</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:41.130" style="s2">of what is going on in intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.570" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">I&#39;m going to come back to those you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.130" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">those ideas in a minute or two this idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">of an analysis of formal analysis a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.410" end="00:03:52.019" style="s2">problem was analyzed into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.459" end="00:03:54.420" style="s2">representation of an initial state in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.019" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">the goal state and I have a problem when</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.420" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">my initial state and my goal state are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">significantly different I can then apply</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">operations or operators these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">actions that will change one state into</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">another State remember me moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:09.630" style="s2">the cup raising my hand for example and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:11.700" style="s2">I can have a sequence of operations that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.630" end="00:04:13.530" style="s2">will like take me from my initial state</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:15.660" style="s2">into my goal state but I have to follow</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.530" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">the path constraints I want to remain a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:19.140" style="s2">general problem solver I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">solve any one problem to the detriment</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.140" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">of my capacity to be a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:25.530" style="s2">solver or then my solving this problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">will undermine my intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.530" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">general so to solve a problem is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">apply a sequence of operations that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">transform the initial state and the goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">state while following the path</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:41.200" style="s2">constraints and then you can analyze</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:44.200" style="s2">that by taking a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.200" end="00:04:47.320" style="s2">space and it was this explication making</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.200" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">explicit of the problem space that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.320" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">the radical and I will in fact argue</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.780" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">profound power in what New Orleans Simon</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:58.170" style="s2">was doing that&#39;s what made that their</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:02.230" style="s2">work so impactful right in so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.170" end="00:05:05.950" style="s2">disciplines now there&#39;s two things we</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.230" end="00:05:09.130" style="s2">have to note about this that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.950" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">potentially misleading right first of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.130" end="00:05:12.310" style="s2">all one is I didn&#39;t draw the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:15.130" style="s2">diagram out and that wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.310" end="00:05:17.500" style="s2">happenstance okay we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:20.140" style="s2">that the second one is this diagram is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:22.540" style="s2">misleading precisely because it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.140" end="00:05:24.070" style="s2">created from God&#39;s eye point of view if</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.540" end="00:05:26.140" style="s2">I were to fill the diagram out you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.070" end="00:05:27.400" style="s2">see all of the pathways at once and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.140" end="00:05:29.950" style="s2">could see at once</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.400" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">which pathway leads from the initial</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.950" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">state to the goal state but of course in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:36.550" style="s2">life when you have a problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">are not out here having a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.550" end="00:05:42.730" style="s2">precisely to be here and you do not know</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.940" end="00:05:44.170" style="s2">which of all these pathways will take</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.730" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">your initial state to your goal state</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.170" end="00:05:47.770" style="s2">while obeying the path constraints you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know that you&#39;re ignorant because</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.770" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">remember we&#39;re not confusing</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:56.070" style="s2">intelligence with knowledge solving this</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:58.450" style="s2">is how you acquire knowledge a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.070" end="00:06:01.990" style="s2">problem-solving method is any method for</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.450" end="00:06:04.210" style="s2">finding the sequence of transformations</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.990" end="00:06:05.530" style="s2">that will take you from the initial</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.530" end="00:06:10.990" style="s2">the cop constraints and you say ok I get</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">it the diagram isn&#39;t complete and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.990" end="00:06:13.900" style="s2">over here you can&#39;t see the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:15.220" style="s2">you don&#39;t know which of all the pathways</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.900" end="00:06:18.520" style="s2">yeah so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.220" end="00:06:19.720" style="s2">well here&#39;s so what when I have analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.520" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">this and formalized it when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:24.970" style="s2">explicate Edyta in terms of problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:27.070" style="s2">space it reveals something I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.970" end="00:06:30.190" style="s2">calculate the number of pathways here by</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.070" end="00:06:31.930" style="s2">the formula F to the D where F is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.190" end="00:06:34.360" style="s2">number of operators on the plying at any</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.930" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">stage and D is the number of stages I go</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.360" end="00:06:43.050" style="s2">through so Keith holyoke gave a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:46.060" style="s2">famous example of this right</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.050" end="00:06:48.070" style="s2">psychologist who was instrumental in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.060" end="00:06:51.550" style="s2">doing important work on the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.070" end="00:06:53.590" style="s2">of problem solving let&#39;s do a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.550" end="00:06:54.650" style="s2">example of this and then it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.590" end="00:06:58.130" style="s2">example because it brings</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.650" end="00:07:02.330" style="s2">machines that we have today so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.130" end="00:07:05.600" style="s2">you&#39;re playing a game of chess right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.330" end="00:07:11.590" style="s2">on average the number of operations you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.600" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">can perform on any turn that&#39;s f is 30</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.210" style="s2">are stupid that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.199" end="00:07:19.490" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to explain how your</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.490" end="00:07:25.250" style="s2">explain it&#39;s not what it can assume okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:30.470" style="s2">so there&#39;s 30 legal moves and on average</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.250" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">there&#39;s 60 turns that&#39;s the number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.470" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">pathways that are in the problem space</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">this is known as combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.940" end="00:07:52.590" style="s2">it sounds like a science-fiction weapon</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a central fact this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.590" end="00:08:01.010" style="s2">a vast number it&#39;s something like four</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:05.060" style="s2">point two nine times ten to the 88 in</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.060" end="00:08:11.930" style="s2">now I want to I want you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.590" end="00:08:18.390" style="s2">how big this is how astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.930" end="00:08:20.220" style="s2">incomprehensibly large this is okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.390" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">one thing you might say is well you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.220" end="00:08:23.850" style="s2">that&#39;s easy I have many different</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.850" end="00:08:27.900" style="s2">and they&#39;re all checking different</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.820" end="00:08:30.510" style="s2">alternative pathways and that&#39;s how I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.900" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">this parallel distributed processing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.510" end="00:08:36.659" style="s2">there&#39;s an important element in that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:38.669" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to be enough because</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.659" end="00:08:41.250" style="s2">you know you probably have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.669" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">around that many neurons now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.250" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">lot but it&#39;s nowhere near this and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">say ah but it&#39;s not the neurons it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">number of connections and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:52.650" style="s2">something like five to the 10 to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:54.900" style="s2">15th and that&#39;s a big number but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.650" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">know what it&#39;s no it&#39;s astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.900" end="00:08:59.700" style="s2">far away from it&#39;s astronomically far</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.970" end="00:24:20.690" style="s2">first of all this idea that part of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.070" end="00:24:22.490" style="s2">makes you intelligence is your ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.690" end="00:24:25.159" style="s2">to use heuristics I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.490" end="00:24:26.929" style="s2">necessary part and the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.159" end="00:24:29.210" style="s2">evidence that we use these heuristics is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.929" end="00:24:33.169" style="s2">quite quite powerful and convincing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.210" end="00:24:36.190" style="s2">well replicated this is also an instance</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.169" end="00:24:39.860" style="s2">of doing really really powerful work and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.190" end="00:24:43.990" style="s2">this will add one more dimension to what</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.159" end="00:24:55.249" style="s2">yes it&#39;s about creating plausible</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.249" end="00:25:03.169" style="s2">integration but there there is another</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.729" end="00:25:11.269" style="s2">again this is going to relate to the</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.269" end="00:25:16.460" style="s2">notice how all all of the aspects all of</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.499" end="00:25:22.190" style="s2">exemplified in what New Orleans Simon</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.359" end="00:25:26.149" style="s2">are doing notice that they&#39;re analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.190" end="00:25:27.889" style="s2">they&#39;re taking right a complex phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.149" end="00:25:30.049" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to analyze it down</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.889" end="00:25:32.839" style="s2">into its basic components just like they</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.049" end="00:25:34.639" style="s2">Lee&#39;s did so long ago when he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.839" end="00:25:37.249" style="s2">to get at the underlying substances and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.639" end="00:25:38.869" style="s2">forces they&#39;re trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.249" end="00:25:40.309" style="s2">ontological depth perception and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.869" end="00:25:41.989" style="s2">like Descartes they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.309" end="00:25:46.009" style="s2">formalize it they&#39;re trying to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.989" end="00:25:48.259" style="s2">graphical mathematical representation</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.009" end="00:25:50.769" style="s2">the problem space is a formalization</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.259" end="00:25:52.879" style="s2">that allows us to do calculations</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.769" end="00:25:55.009" style="s2">equations that&#39;s how I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.879" end="00:25:58.399" style="s2">explain to you combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.009" end="00:26:02.119" style="s2">and then what they were doing right is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.399" end="00:26:03.379" style="s2">they were trying to mechanize I know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.119" end="00:26:07.460" style="s2">that will make some people&#39;s hackles</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.379" end="00:26:10.580" style="s2">rise but the point of this is I I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.460" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">this right if I can make a machine that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.580" end="00:26:16.879" style="s2">can carry out my formal analysis because</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:21.619" style="s2">that means I haven&#39;t snuck anything in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.879" end="00:26:24.440" style="s2">and that really matters because it turns</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.619" end="00:26:29.499" style="s2">out that trying to explain the mind we</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.440" end="00:26:29.499" style="s2">often fall into a particular fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.270" end="00:26:42.260" style="s2">okay so you know how would you see well</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.070" end="00:26:44.390" style="s2">here&#39;s a triangle out here and the light</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.260" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">comes off of it when it goes into your</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.390" end="00:26:51.230" style="s2">eye right so that&#39;s a really horrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.550" style="s2">eye goes into your eye and then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.230" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">nerve impulse is and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.550" end="00:26:55.880" style="s2">equivocate on the notion of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.960" end="00:26:58.190" style="s2">to hide all kinds of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.880" end="00:27:00.890" style="s2">problems and then it goes into like it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.190" end="00:27:02.660" style="s2">goes into this space inside of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.890" end="00:27:04.070" style="s2">wait but it&#39;s called maybe working</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.660" end="00:27:06.110" style="s2">memory or something and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.070" end="00:27:08.450" style="s2">projected onto some inner screen and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.110" end="00:27:10.430" style="s2">there there it is it&#39;s projected there</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.450" end="00:27:12.260" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a little man in here</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.430" end="00:27:13.850" style="s2">the Latin for little man is homunculus</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.260" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">and the little man</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.850" end="00:27:21.590" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s your central executive or</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:25.070" style="s2">something says triangle so that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.590" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">works right and notice notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.070" end="00:27:29.770" style="s2">going on here it sounds like I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:32.330" style="s2">a mechanical excellent and then I invoke</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.770" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">something now what you should ask me</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.330" end="00:27:36.920" style="s2">right away is the is the following ah</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:39.140" style="s2">yes but John how does the little man</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.920" end="00:27:41.720" style="s2">the little homunculus see the inner</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.140" end="00:27:45.260" style="s2">triangle oh well inside his head is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.720" end="00:27:46.700" style="s2">smaller space with a smaller projection</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.260" end="00:27:51.140" style="s2">in the middle and there&#39;s a little man</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.700" end="00:27:53.150" style="s2">in there that okay and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.140" end="00:27:57.110" style="s2">forth and you see what this gets this</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.150" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">gives you an infinite regress it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.110" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">explain anything why this is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.690" end="00:28:06.950" style="s2">circular explanation remember we we</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:11.450" style="s2">talked about this right this is when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.950" end="00:28:12.890" style="s2">using vision to explain vision and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.450" end="00:28:14.390" style="s2">say well yeah that&#39;s stupid I get by</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.890" end="00:28:16.160" style="s2">that stupid that&#39;s non explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.390" end="00:28:19.160" style="s2">circular explanations are non</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.160" end="00:28:25.730" style="s2">not explanatory but here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.430" end="00:28:27.470" style="s2">ultimately have to do and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.730" end="00:28:29.390" style="s2">Newell and Simon are trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.470" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to take a mental term</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.390" end="00:28:38.060" style="s2">intelligence and they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:40.250" style="s2">analyze it formalize it and mechanize it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.060" end="00:28:43.790" style="s2">so they can explain it using non mental</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.250" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">terms because if I always use mine to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.790" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">explain mine</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:49.650" style="s2">I&#39;m actually never explaining the mine</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">I&#39;m just engaged in a circular</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.650" end="00:29:00.840" style="s2">explanation what Newell and Simon are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:02.760" style="s2">trying to do is analyze formalize and</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.460" end="00:29:13.020" style="s2">technology maybe some of those things</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:15.660" style="s2">are true about them but independent from</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.020" end="00:29:18.750" style="s2">that I can argue is which is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.660" end="00:29:22.400" style="s2">doing that the reason they&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.750" end="00:29:26.010" style="s2">is that it exemplifies the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.400" end="00:29:29.340" style="s2">method because it is precisely designed</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.340" end="00:29:32.760" style="s2">long as I&#39;m explaining the mental in</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.170" end="00:29:36.810" style="s2">terms of the mental I&#39;m not actually</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.870" end="00:30:25.860" style="s2">produced this scientific worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:28.860" style="s2">seems to be explaining everything except</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.860" end="00:30:32.460" style="s2">how I generate scientific explanations</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:35.040" style="s2">my intelligence my ability to generate</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.460" end="00:30:36.630" style="s2">science is not one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.040" end="00:30:39.420" style="s2">encompassed by the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.630" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">there&#39;s this hole in the naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.420" end="00:30:44.220" style="s2">worldview that&#39;s why many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:47.070" style="s2">critical of naturalism always zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.220" end="00:30:49.050" style="s2">our capacity to make meaning and have</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:52.400" style="s2">consciousness as the thing that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.050" end="00:30:56.430" style="s2">being explained their right to do that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.400" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">think they&#39;re wrong to conclude that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.430" end="00:31:02.889" style="s2">that somehow legitimates</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:06.940" style="s2">other kinds of worldviews right we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.889" end="00:31:08.289" style="s2">come back to that because I think what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">you need to show is you need to show</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.289" end="00:31:13.179" style="s2">that this project yeah because this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:14.620" style="s2">an inductive argument it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.179" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">deductive you have to show that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.620" end="00:31:19.179" style="s2">project is failing that we&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:21.220" style="s2">progress on it and that&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.179" end="00:31:24.460" style="s2">thing to say you can&#39;t you can&#39;t defeat</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.220" end="00:31:26.919" style="s2">a scientific program by saying 22 things</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.460" end="00:31:28.269" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t yet explained because if</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.919" end="00:31:31.299" style="s2">that will always be the case you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.269" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">point to problems it faces right what</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.299" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">you have to do and this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.590" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">think that lack ratash made very clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:38.309" style="s2">you have to point to the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:42.669" style="s2">not making any progress in improving our</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.309" end="00:31:44.860" style="s2">explanation and it&#39;s really questionable</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.669" end="00:31:47.220" style="s2">and I mean that term seriously that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.860" end="00:31:49.899" style="s2">we&#39;re not making any progress in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.220" end="00:31:52.360" style="s2">explaining intelligence by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.899" end="00:31:54.220" style="s2">analyze formalizing mechanize it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.360" end="00:31:59.080" style="s2">that&#39;s getting really hard to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.220" end="00:32:01.080" style="s2">we&#39;re not making any progress now why</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.080" end="00:32:03.820" style="s2">does this matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.080" end="00:32:06.669" style="s2">because if cognitive science can have</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.820" end="00:32:08.879" style="s2">give create a synoptic integration by</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.669" end="00:32:11.139" style="s2">creating plausible constructs</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.879" end="00:32:14.860" style="s2">theoretical ways of explanation like</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.860" end="00:32:19.289" style="s2">allow us to analyze formalize and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.450" end="00:32:21.700" style="s2">mechanized they have the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.289" end="00:32:24.909" style="s2">making us part of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.700" end="00:32:28.690" style="s2">worldview not as animals or machines but</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.909" end="00:32:30.419" style="s2">giving a scientific explanation of our</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.779" end="00:32:43.259" style="s2">actually excluded us from as the</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.200" end="00:32:58.360" style="s2">so New Orleans címon are creating this</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.360" end="00:33:03.010" style="s2">and mechanizing intelligence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.790" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">lots of stuff converging on it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.010" end="00:33:05.650" style="s2">stuff from how we measure intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:08.170" style="s2">talk about it I were trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.650" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">machines right and and it holds a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.170" end="00:33:12.600" style="s2">promise for revealing things about</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.600" end="00:33:18.400" style="s2">like the fact that the one of the core</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:20.500" style="s2">aspects of intelligence is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.400" end="00:33:22.750" style="s2">your ability to avoid common tutorial</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.179" end="00:33:38.830" style="s2">praising New Orleans Simon for now now I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">want to criticize them because New</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">a valuable part of the multi Optus a</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.450" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">had an assumption in their attempt to</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.429" end="00:34:47.500" style="s2">you remember charlie nostalgia we have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.490" end="00:34:49.810" style="s2">heuristic of essentialism this is also a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.500" end="00:34:54.700" style="s2">term that has been taken up and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.810" end="00:34:57.580" style="s2">often applied loosely within political</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.700" end="00:35:02.030" style="s2">controversy and discourse</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.580" end="00:35:04.310" style="s2">the idea of essentialism is that when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.030" end="00:35:05.570" style="s2">group a bunch of things together with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.310" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">term remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.570" end="00:35:09.470" style="s2">Ockham&#39;s ideas about we group things</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:11.210" style="s2">together just by the words we use for</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.470" end="00:35:13.490" style="s2">them that&#39;s nominalism but when I group</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.300" end="00:35:30.620" style="s2">that some things clearly fall in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.870" style="s2">category triangles have an essence all</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.870" end="00:35:37.880" style="s2">size have three straight lines three</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.810" end="00:35:40.610" style="s2">angles and the angles add up to 180</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.880" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">degrees and if you have each and every</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.610" end="00:35:45.140" style="s2">one of those you are a triangle right</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:46.760" style="s2">and there are also natural kinds one of</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.660" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">essence so all gold things have a set of</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:36:02.570" style="s2">gold right and we&#39;ll talk about why</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:05.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the case later not everything we</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.150" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">pointed up by Vic and Stein right has an</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:22.580" style="s2">example first if you remember right we</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.810" end="00:36:24.350" style="s2">call many things games now what what set</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.580" end="00:36:30.740" style="s2">of necessary and sufficient conditions</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.350" end="00:36:33.260" style="s2">do all and only games possess right well</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.740" end="00:36:34.370" style="s2">all they involve competition well there</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.260" end="00:36:36.980" style="s2">are many things that involve competition</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.370" end="00:36:38.060" style="s2">that aren&#39;t games war and there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.980" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">games that don&#39;t seem to involve</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.060" end="00:36:43.000" style="s2">competition like catch oh well you at</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:47.240" style="s2">least they involve other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.000" end="00:36:49.810" style="s2">solitaire oh they well they have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.240" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">involve imagination it&#39;s all the terror</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.810" end="00:36:58.730" style="s2">but they have to involve pretense catch</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:37:01.150" style="s2">what do you pretending to do and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.730" end="00:37:04.280" style="s2">Vic and Stein&#39;s point you won&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.150" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">definition that includes all and only</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.280" end="00:37:10.340" style="s2">games and this is the case for many</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.080" end="00:37:11.540" style="s2">things like chair table etc remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.340" end="00:37:17.030" style="s2">this was all part</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.540" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">what Arkham was pointing to I think so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.030" end="00:37:24.020" style="s2">the idea is we come with a heuristic we</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:27.980" style="s2">treat any category as if it has an</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.020" end="00:37:29.450" style="s2">essence but many categories don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.980" end="00:37:30.620" style="s2">essences we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.450" end="00:37:37.340" style="s2">that shortly in a few minutes when we</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.620" end="00:37:40.670" style="s2">talk about categorization why do we use</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.340" end="00:37:45.080" style="s2">this heuristic because it makes us look</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.670" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">for essences why do we want to look for</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.080" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">essences because this allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:53.230" style="s2">generalize and make very good</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:55.850" style="s2">predictions yes I can over generalize</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.230" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">but I can also under generalize that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.850" end="00:38:07.250" style="s2">also a mistake so we use this heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.870" style="s2">because it&#39;s adaptive it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.900" end="00:43:11.300" style="s2">have good notes and well yeah okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:13.160" style="s2">so what should I do and all you&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.300" end="00:43:16.190" style="s2">give me synonyms for relevance realized</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.160" end="00:43:17.840" style="s2">right I should pay attention to the</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.550" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">and how do you do that oh well you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.220" end="00:43:27.950" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious to me or it stands out to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:33.410" style="s2">me great but how how would I make a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.950" end="00:43:35.540" style="s2">machine be able to do that what are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.410" end="00:43:38.330" style="s2">operations oh I write stuff down do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.540" end="00:43:40.820" style="s2">do I just write stuff down right like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.330" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">draw I make arrows I do I write</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.820" end="00:43:44.180" style="s2">everything down well no I don&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:45.710" style="s2">everything down and I don&#39;t just what</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.180" end="00:43:47.930" style="s2">are the operations does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.710" end="00:43:49.340" style="s2">everybody&#39;s notes will look the same no</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.930" end="00:43:53.330" style="s2">when I do this in class everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.340" end="00:43:54.680" style="s2">notes look remarkably very different so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.330" end="00:43:56.060" style="s2">what are the operations and what does</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.680" end="00:43:58.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the goal state look like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.060" end="00:44:00.530" style="s2">good notes great what are the properties</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.280" end="00:44:01.220" style="s2">of good notes well they&#39;re useful why</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.530" end="00:44:05.210" style="s2">are they useful</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.220" end="00:44:07.250" style="s2">well Beco oh right because they contain</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.870" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">it what&#39;s actually missing in an</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.270" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">and turn them something into something</p>
