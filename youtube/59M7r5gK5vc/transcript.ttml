<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">somebody things nicely but what if</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">they&#39;re from courtesans offline but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.040" end="00:00:44.089" style="s2">you know it&#39;s legitimate that we should</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">support people taking responsibility but</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.089" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">it&#39;s important to ask what&#39;s in the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">of that and how we help them get there</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">let&#39;s look at that&#39;s a real question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">you have spent a lot of time with these</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:57.989" style="s2">patients so that with addicted patients</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:01:00.629" style="s2">in your work well with myself and with</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.989" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">yourself yeah I find it quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.629" end="00:01:04.710" style="s2">interesting that you have explored the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:07.250" style="s2">shadow side of humanity and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.710" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">know so well how desperately we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.250" end="00:01:15.060" style="s2">tools of transformation yeah and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">many people are stuck and could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.060" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">liberated if there was another way so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">find it quite striking then how you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">discovered psychedelics which are tools</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:26.910" style="s2">for transformation and can yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">among the tools is the in the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.910" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">settings liberate us and the rigidity of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">our thoughts for sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">now of course spiritual modalities the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">pathways of all kinds from way before</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">the Buddha to the present time have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:48.619" style="s2">asked the same question agent Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">know and and Greece Pythagoras</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.619" end="00:01:54.770" style="s2">Socrates so these questions have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:54.770" style="s2">asked for a long long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.130" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">certainly one powerful and in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">experience effective pathway for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:07.489" style="s2">of people not for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">excuse me is the route of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.489" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">precisely because they get underneath</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:15.150" style="s2">the defenses that we built up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:18.329" style="s2">childhood and they get to the core of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.150" end="00:02:21.329" style="s2">the issues that motivate us but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.329" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">also can take us down to that real stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.329" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.890" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">actually experienced their real selves</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">may reveal the true being of a being</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">absolutely that can happen to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean that having study</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">being revealed to you therefore you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:37.900" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">badi it so there&#39;s a you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:44.470" style="s2">and as my wife could tell you we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.760" end="00:02:46.980" style="s2">to being the same jerk that you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.470" end="00:02:50.110" style="s2">before the experience unless there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:52.120" style="s2">unless there&#39;s integration honestly deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.110" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">immersion unless there&#39;s a practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.120" end="00:02:57.370" style="s2">around it but as a way of revealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">these truths and and and helping people</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.370" end="00:03:03.430" style="s2">transform really psychedelics or in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:05.380" style="s2">right context I need to emphasize that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.430" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">under the right guidance in the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.380" end="00:03:11.410" style="s2">context right leadership right</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">counseling right integration they can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.410" end="00:03:16.690" style="s2">extraordinarily effective mmm so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">said a few things their environment our</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:23.500" style="s2">preparation intention then integration</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:26.830" style="s2">these are all vitally important to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.500" end="00:03:29.110" style="s2">outcome and how changed you are from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:32.650" style="s2">psychedelic experience health how much</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.650" end="00:03:37.960" style="s2">thing that really helped me at your</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.020" end="00:03:39.640" style="s2">workshop at cyclic science 2017 was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.960" end="00:03:42.010" style="s2">focus you put on the creation of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.640" end="00:03:43.570" style="s2">intention and recently be going quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.010" end="00:03:44.980" style="s2">deep in Buddhist practice and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.570" end="00:03:47.140" style="s2">discovering that the same thing applies</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.980" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">for what is practice you&#39;re encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.140" end="00:03:52.330" style="s2">to stay fuel made it your intention to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:54.850" style="s2">meditate each time you meditate so quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.330" end="00:03:56.830" style="s2">I&#39;d love for you to share some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.850" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">thoughts and some of the reflections you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.830" end="00:04:01.300" style="s2">would consider when recommending someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:04.300" style="s2">create an intention for a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.300" end="00:04:06.220" style="s2">experience so if you look at the root of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.300" end="00:04:08.440" style="s2">the word intention it comes in Latin</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.220" end="00:04:10.660" style="s2">were a ten year which is to stretch or</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">tener at the stretch so intention is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.660" end="00:04:15.270" style="s2">something that you wanna stretch towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">internally that you want to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.270" end="00:04:20.590" style="s2">like an agency it&#39;s like exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:20.950" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah that&#39;s cool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.590" end="00:04:22.750" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.860" end="00:04:39.010" style="s2">whatever so as people do or you can have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.330" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">an intention that&#39;s related to your</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.010" end="00:04:44.020" style="s2">personal development</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">now somebody might go into the ceremony</p>
