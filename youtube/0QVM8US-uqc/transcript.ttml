<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">tickets and that was a huge success</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to say finally because</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">who knows what John will come up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">next in 2006 John launched national</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">popular vote an audacious move to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.619" style="s2">replace the electoral college in</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">won&#39;t you tell us a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">scratch off lottery ticket how did you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:23.100" style="s2">come up with that idea well while I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">a graduate student at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.100" end="00:02:29.100" style="s2">Michigan in the 1960s I had a part-time</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">job doing computer programming for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">company that made commercial promotional</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">games the kind of games that were run at</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">the time of in gas stations and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:43.260" style="s2">supermarkets to increase sales and one</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">of the categories of games they had were</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">called probability games and these were</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">game tickets where the customer would</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">only rub off a subset of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">rub off spots on the ticket maybe three</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">out of 12 and if the right symbols were</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:04.860" style="s2">under the three spots that the customer</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">chose they would win a prize these were</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:08.880" style="s2">called probability games because every</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">single ticket was a potential winner of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.880" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">perhaps $100 so the tickets obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:17.580" style="s2">had to have a secure covering and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:20.549" style="s2">was a technology it existed at the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">but more importantly if you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.549" end="00:03:26.310" style="s2">offering $100 in each ticket savvy</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">customers and in particular savvy clerks</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.310" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">in the gas stations and supermarkets</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">might be able to find the winning spots</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">on tickets by looking at little printing</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">irregularities that existed on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:44.310" style="s2">tickets so there was a problem of how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">I make these tickets secure though that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.310" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">you could offer a prize perhaps $100</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">cash on every ticket and do so safely</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">without causing the supermarket or gas</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">station to go bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">okay had that been lead to the lottery</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:02.880" style="s2">ticket well we did successfully produce</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">these probability games for commercial</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.880" end="00:04:09.950" style="s2">clients in the late 60s and early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:12.420" style="s2">and we did so securely and we did it by</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.950" end="00:04:15.239" style="s2">printing roughly a half a million</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.420" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">different ticket combinations so that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.239" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">you rub the first spot even if there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">a printing irregularity on the exterior</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:26.040" style="s2">or the under the spot that a person</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">might notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.040" end="00:04:31.620" style="s2">would be d correlated with what was on</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">other spots on the ticket and the way we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">did that is if there were 12 spots on</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">the ticket</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:39.390" style="s2">we might print four of the spots on one</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:41.570" style="s2">pass and this is at a time when you were</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.390" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">printing tickets on big sheets</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.570" end="00:04:47.700" style="s2">lithographically you might have ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:50.010" style="s2">different kinds of sheets each would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.700" end="00:04:53.340" style="s2">a hundred tickets so you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.010" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">thousand different patterns that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.340" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">not be sufficient to provide security</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">because if you had a given symbol under</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:04.200" style="s2">a given spot a thousand is simply not</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">enough to D correlate with what&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.200" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">other spot so then we would take these</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:12.150" style="s2">big stacks of sheets and ten stacks we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:16.380" style="s2">collate the sheets one by one and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">print ten more print four spots each on</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.380" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">each of the thousand tickets so that now</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:24.480" style="s2">there were eight of the twelve spots and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">then we would again gather up the sheets</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.480" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">one by one and do it a third time so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:34.260" style="s2">that we would get roughly 1/2 million</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">different combinations of tickets and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.260" end="00:05:39.450" style="s2">particularly there&#39;d be no correlation</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">between a East spot that you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.450" end="00:05:45.450" style="s2">uncover with one rub and where that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:47.370" style="s2">desirable second and third symbol would</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">be on the ticket so we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.370" end="00:05:52.650" style="s2">produce a secure game that offered a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">very substantial prize that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.650" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">hundred dollars on each and every ticket</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">and do so securely now what does that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">have to do with state lotteries well the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:03.420" style="s2">state lotteries were just getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">started in the 60s there were just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.420" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">handful of them and they were all</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">running rather uninteresting raffle type</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:14.790" style="s2">games where they would print tickets</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:17.040" style="s2">with say a six digit number and once a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.790" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">week they hold a drawing and if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.040" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">match the number or part of the number</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:23.760" style="s2">you went a prize so there was no</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:27.930" style="s2">immediate gratification there was no</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.760" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">particular excitement or artistic ness</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:34.980" style="s2">or attractiveness to the tickets and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:37.740" style="s2">sales were languishing in all the state</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.980" end="00:06:38.040" style="s2">lotteries so we had the idea when I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:40.170" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.040" end="00:06:43.290" style="s2">for this commercial game company of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.170" end="00:06:45.510" style="s2">saying well if the state lotteries could</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.290" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">have an instant gratification use this</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.510" end="00:06:50.280" style="s2">rub off technology and all those states</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:39.450" style="s2">around the state so that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.780" end="00:07:41.430" style="s2">pick out the winning tickets though I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.450" end="00:07:43.650" style="s2">remember in Maryland again my home state</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.430" end="00:07:45.510" style="s2">there was a big scandal because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.650" end="00:07:47.610" style="s2">turned out there was a way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.510" end="00:07:50.940" style="s2">which was that the winning tickets were</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.610" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">slightly smaller than the non winning</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.940" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">tickets I don&#39;t know if they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:56.610" style="s2">printed separately before they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.680" style="s2">mixed in or what and there was a gang of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:08:00.030" style="s2">criminals that went around to all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.680" end="00:08:03.150" style="s2">convenience stores and all the liquor</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.030" end="00:08:04.740" style="s2">stores and paid the clerk some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:07.770" style="s2">money to go through the tickets and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.740" end="00:08:09.510" style="s2">measure them and were able to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.770" end="00:08:11.610" style="s2">the winners so there was at least one</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.510" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">way somebody did hack that particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.610" end="00:08:15.930" style="s2">problem of course they fixed that but an</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:17.880" style="s2">example of how smart adversarial agents</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.930" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">were that was of course a commercial</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.880" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">gain out of the state lottery there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:25.500" style="s2">never an incidence of successful pick</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:27.390" style="s2">out in a state lottery no that was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.500" end="00:08:29.100" style="s2">scratch-off Maryland State Lottery they</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.390" end="00:08:31.770" style="s2">were able to hack it based on the sides</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.100" end="00:08:33.660" style="s2">of card I do recall that quite vividly I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.770" end="00:08:35.550" style="s2">believe it was probably in the late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.660" end="00:08:37.290" style="s2">maybe early eighties well they fixed it</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.550" end="00:08:38.550" style="s2">it was you know probably a problem where</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.290" end="00:08:40.770" style="s2">they&#39;re having imprinted into different</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.550" end="00:08:43.410" style="s2">printers and the size of stock was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.770" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">slightly smaller on the winners but</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.410" end="00:08:47.910" style="s2">anyway so you developed this technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:49.860" style="s2">so that no one could get through the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.910" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">print or at least out of the the cover</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.860" end="00:08:52.440" style="s2">thing though I imagine you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:53.970" style="s2">probably do it with electro</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.440" end="00:08:56.940" style="s2">microscope or something but not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.970" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">worthwhile to do it a clerk ripoff level</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.940" end="00:09:00.780" style="s2">how did that then turn into a company</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">and how did you convince the states to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.780" end="00:09:05.400" style="s2">do this well because we did have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.000" end="00:09:09.210" style="s2">secure method of printing the tickets</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.400" end="00:09:10.890" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what you remember but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.210" end="00:09:13.620" style="s2">can assure you none of the tickets</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.890" end="00:09:15.870" style="s2">produced by scientific games had ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.620" end="00:09:17.910" style="s2">been compromised in that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.870" end="00:09:20.310" style="s2">perhaps they ran a game with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.910" end="00:09:23.430" style="s2">else that I was aware of but we had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.310" end="00:09:25.470" style="s2">method to securely print the tickets so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.430" end="00:09:29.220" style="s2">that there would be no agent picked out</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.470" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">and we first convinced the Massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.220" end="00:09:34.710" style="s2">lottery to run an instant lottery which</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:36.990" style="s2">was a very big step at the time because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.710" end="00:09:39.870" style="s2">they were introducing a new type of game</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.990" end="00:09:43.170" style="s2">with this potential agent pick out</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:45.750" style="s2">problem and they did that in the spring</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">of 1974 it was immediately very</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.750" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">successful tripled the sales of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">Massachusetts lottery and every</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2">subsequent lottery that adopted it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:59.610" style="s2">that was the beginning of our company</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">scientific games our business was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.610" end="00:10:04.260" style="s2">selling instant lottery tickets to state</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.010" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">lotteries cool and did you guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.260" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">basically own that business or was it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">what do you have competitors well when</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">we started we were actually the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:16.080" style="s2">company to get the contract from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:18.870" style="s2">Massachusetts Lottery to run their</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.080" end="00:10:21.210" style="s2">instant game but each of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.870" end="00:10:24.200" style="s2">four companies that got the contract</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.210" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">which included some very well-known now</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.200" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">banknote printing companies each of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:32.100" style="s2">when they printed the sample tickets for</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:33.660" style="s2">the lottery the lottery was able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.100" end="00:10:37.650" style="s2">compromise the tickets from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.660" end="00:10:40.680" style="s2">contracts were cancelled so we were the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.650" end="00:10:42.870" style="s2">fifth company to get a contract and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.680" end="00:10:45.060" style="s2">successfully printed a secured ticket</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.870" end="00:10:47.850" style="s2">and got it on the street and produced</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.060" end="00:10:50.610" style="s2">the commercial success and from that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.850" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">went to all the other states at the time</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.610" end="00:10:55.470" style="s2">and offered the instant lottery and of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:57.930" style="s2">course the state lotteries were quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.470" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">anxious to start running the instant</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.930" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">lottery yeah and as you say they&#39;re big</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">big business for the states today what</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:06.089" style="s2">do you think of the morality of things</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:08.220" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.089" end="00:11:09.629" style="s2">I&#39;ve read fair amount that says that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.220" end="00:11:11.670" style="s2">know the use of these kinds particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.629" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">the scratch-off lottery is inversely</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.670" end="00:11:15.269" style="s2">proportional to people&#39;s incomes well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.009" style="s2">haven&#39;t been about in the lottery</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.269" end="00:11:19.410" style="s2">business for thirty years but it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.009" end="00:11:22.199" style="s2">definitely not the case when I was there</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.410" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">in fact we did the extensive marketing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.199" end="00:11:29.459" style="s2">studies Danskin lottery had a actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:32.459" style="s2">higher income profile than lotteries in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.459" end="00:11:34.230" style="s2">general that is the raffle type lottery</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.459" end="00:11:37.350" style="s2">or the lotto games that came along</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.230" end="00:11:39.899" style="s2">mainly because the ticket was a more</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.350" end="00:11:42.569" style="s2">expensive ticket it was a dollar ticket</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.899" end="00:11:46.170" style="s2">at the time whereas other lottery ticket</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.569" end="00:11:47.819" style="s2">were fifty cents so at least at the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.170" end="00:11:50.749" style="s2">when I was involved in the business</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.819" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">which was until the late eighties the</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.540" style="s2">distinctly not lower income it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.410" end="00:11:59.610" style="s2">distinctly middle income okay well</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:01.649" style="s2">that&#39;s good well that&#39;s enough on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.870" end="00:13:35.770" style="s2">time and he had of course I&#39;m adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:39.880" style="s2">systems and one of the papers we read</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.770" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">was freiburg&#39;s paper on trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.880" end="00:13:44.580" style="s2">computer automatically learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:47.710" style="s2">program itself to solve a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.580" end="00:13:51.010" style="s2">that was through a mutational method and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.710" end="00:13:54.930" style="s2">I was very taken by that idea at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:57.610" style="s2">time and my eventual PhD thesis was</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.930" end="00:13:59.740" style="s2">somewhat related to that it was not</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:02.920" style="s2">actually a thesis on genetic programming</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.740" end="00:14:06.490" style="s2">it was attempted algorithm to infer</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.920" end="00:14:08.620" style="s2">grammar from data but inferring a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:11.290" style="s2">grammar from data it can be seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.620" end="00:14:16.810" style="s2">way of writing a computer program in any</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.290" end="00:14:18.520" style="s2">case my thesis was sort of inspired from</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.810" end="00:14:20.770" style="s2">the field of genetic algorithms even</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.520" end="00:14:23.650" style="s2">though it wasn&#39;t in the field of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.770" end="00:14:25.750" style="s2">algorithms and it was inspired by this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.650" end="00:14:28.180" style="s2">idea of trying to get computers to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.750" end="00:14:31.650" style="s2">program themselves even though it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.180" end="00:14:35.050" style="s2">exactly that so from somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.650" end="00:14:38.020" style="s2">1976 right when John Holland&#39;s book came</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.050" end="00:14:40.450" style="s2">out and I was in the lottery business at</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.020" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">the time and quite busy running around</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.450" end="00:14:45.130" style="s2">selling tickets to state lotteries I did</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:47.590" style="s2">buy a copy of his book right when it</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.130" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">came out and as you were influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.590" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">it so was I very good it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:55.300" style="s2">for our audience if you could go into</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:14:56.650" style="s2">the basics a little bit just Vicki but</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.300" end="00:14:59.110" style="s2">very basic that we have a well-educated</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.650" end="00:15:01.870" style="s2">audience but not experts in either</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.110" end="00:15:04.150" style="s2">computer science or genetic or</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.870" end="00:15:06.070" style="s2">evolutionary algorithms how do genetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.150" end="00:15:08.700" style="s2">algorithms work and then how was that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.070" end="00:15:11.740" style="s2">idea extended to genetic programming</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.700" end="00:15:15.010" style="s2">well the idea that genetic algorithm is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.740" end="00:15:18.040" style="s2">a vaguely patterned after the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.010" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">DNA that is you have a linear string of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:23.800" style="s2">symbols with DNA it&#39;s four symbols in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:26.260" style="s2">the classic simplest form of the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.800" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">algorithm the string is just a binary</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.260" end="00:15:31.930" style="s2">string of ones and zeros and those ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">and zeros mean something in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.930" end="00:15:35.569" style="s2">some problem for</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">the first few symbols might together</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.569" end="00:15:43.069" style="s2">specify the size of an insect swing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:46.129" style="s2">maybe the next few symbols might specify</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.069" end="00:15:49.160" style="s2">the body color and maybe the next ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.129" end="00:15:53.149" style="s2">would be the type of clawed insect has</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.160" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">etc so that the idea of the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.149" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">algorithm was that there would be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:15:59.299" style="s2">string of ones and zeros that would</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.309" style="s2">represent something in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.299" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">something perhaps you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.309" end="00:16:06.859" style="s2">optimize and you would do the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:08.149" style="s2">optimization in the following way first</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.859" end="00:16:10.939" style="s2">of all you would create a random</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.149" end="00:16:14.029" style="s2">population of these strings of ones and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.939" end="00:16:18.410" style="s2">zeros maybe a thousand strings of length</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.029" end="00:16:20.619" style="s2">of say 50 and totally at random and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.410" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">you would look at each of these random</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.619" end="00:16:25.309" style="s2">thousand individuals and say how good</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:26.509" style="s2">are these insects of doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.309" end="00:16:30.379" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be doing maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.509" end="00:16:33.799" style="s2">foraging and getting fat on the food to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.379" end="00:16:36.889" style="s2">eat so you would assign a fitness to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.799" end="00:16:40.549" style="s2">each of these thousand randomly chosen</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.889" end="00:16:42.459" style="s2">strings fitness being how good are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.549" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">things that these strings represent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.459" end="00:16:48.110" style="s2">solving the problem at hand which is say</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:50.299" style="s2">getting fat I&#39;m happy that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.110" end="00:16:53.119" style="s2">population with Fitness which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.299" end="00:16:56.299" style="s2">somewhat similar to the Darwinian notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.119" end="00:16:58.579" style="s2">of natural selection and then the notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.299" end="00:17:00.850" style="s2">of the genetic algorithm is you start</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.579" end="00:17:04.370" style="s2">with the random population of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.850" end="00:17:07.029" style="s2">individuals and you modify that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.370" end="00:17:10.809" style="s2">population and create a new generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.029" end="00:17:14.539" style="s2">with a small part of that thousand maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.809" end="00:17:17.449" style="s2">10% you just do a random mutation where</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.539" end="00:17:20.600" style="s2">you flip one of the bits from 0 to 1 or</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.449" end="00:17:25.220" style="s2">1 to 0 and that would correspond to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.600" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">random mutation say of a DNA string the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.220" end="00:17:30.289" style="s2">same sort of random mutation where if it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:32.779" style="s2">happens at the wrong place can make the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.289" end="00:17:35.630" style="s2">difference between having sickle-cell</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.779" end="00:17:38.120" style="s2">anemia because of having defective</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.630" end="00:17:41.750" style="s2">hemoglobin are not having sickle-cell</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.120" end="00:17:45.409" style="s2">anemia or cystic for a process or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.750" end="00:17:46.790" style="s2">having cystic fibrosis so mutation is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.409" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">way to</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">making a very small very localized</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">change and that notion of breeding a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.690" style="s2">population of binary strings have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:02.990" style="s2">floating around since the late 40s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.690" end="00:18:05.630" style="s2">actually one of the first computer runs</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.990" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2">on the computer that they had at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:12.710" style="s2">Center for Advanced Studies at Princeton</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:15.650" style="s2">was a simple genetic algorithm run made</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.710" end="00:18:19.580" style="s2">him I believe the late forties but what</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.650" end="00:18:23.030" style="s2">Holland added was the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:26.930" style="s2">real engine of creation in nature and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.030" end="00:18:30.890" style="s2">evolution is sexual reproduction where a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.930" end="00:18:34.700" style="s2">major part of the genome this string of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.890" end="00:18:37.040" style="s2">length 50 comes from one parent the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.700" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">other part of the string comes from</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.040" end="00:18:42.020" style="s2">another parent and this is roughly</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">analogous to the way sexual reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">occurs in simple genomes okay and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.340" end="00:18:51.020" style="s2">would be the bulk of the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:54.530" style="s2">that creates the new generation so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.020" end="00:18:57.920" style="s2">10% might be a mere copying based on</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.530" end="00:19:01.850" style="s2">reproduction and or some mutation but</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.920" end="00:19:04.220" style="s2">maybe 90% or 80% would be crossover that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.850" end="00:19:06.230" style="s2">is the sexual recombination where you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.220" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">take a major part of the genome of one</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.230" end="00:19:12.890" style="s2">individual and you made it with a major</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:15.830" style="s2">part of the genome of a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.890" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">individual creating an offspring that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.830" end="00:19:22.190" style="s2">has a major number of characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:25.070" style="s2">from the father and a major number of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.190" end="00:19:27.740" style="s2">characteristics from the mother so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.070" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">takes us from the initial read of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.740" end="00:19:31.550" style="s2">generation to the first generation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:33.470" style="s2">then the essence of the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.550" end="00:19:35.090" style="s2">algorithm is to go through many many</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.470" end="00:19:38.420" style="s2">generations maybe hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.090" end="00:19:41.750" style="s2">generations or thousands and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.420" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">refine the population based on a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">just straight reproduction copying</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:50.990" style="s2">individual proportion we based on their</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:54.350" style="s2">fitness a tiny bit of mutation again</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.990" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">selecting the individuals proportionate</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.350" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">to their fitness but then a major</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:00.380" style="s2">portion of population being shuffled</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:03.950" style="s2">around in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.380" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">very disruptive way called crossover to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.950" end="00:20:09.620" style="s2">produce new individuals and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.220" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">you can solve a whole bunch of very</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.620" end="00:20:15.020" style="s2">interesting engineering optimization</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:16.850" style="s2">problems by using the genetic algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.020" end="00:20:19.550" style="s2">as well as a whole variety of other</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.850" end="00:20:22.190" style="s2">problems yeah that&#39;s quite remarkable I</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.550" end="00:20:24.260" style="s2">remember when I first started writing</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.190" end="00:20:27.710" style="s2">evolutionary computation you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.260" end="00:20:29.180" style="s2">go holy moley I do nothing at all other</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.710" end="00:20:31.910" style="s2">than set up this environment and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.180" end="00:20:33.500" style="s2">evolution itself drives the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.910" end="00:20:35.660" style="s2">for lots as you say many many problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.500" end="00:20:38.090" style="s2">it works sometimes it works very slowly</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.660" end="00:20:40.670" style="s2">I would often describe genetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.090" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">algorithms or my own particular variant</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.670" end="00:20:47.510" style="s2">which was neural nets encoded as genetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:50.120" style="s2">algorithms back in 2001 I&#39;d say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.510" end="00:20:52.280" style="s2">very general method but a very weak one</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.120" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">and that it takes a very long time and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.280" end="00:20:56.600" style="s2">lot of computation to converge on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">solution at least for a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.600" end="00:21:01.160" style="s2">problem I&#39;d also like to highlight for</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.740" end="00:21:17.720" style="s2">fitness now there&#39;s lots of different</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.170" end="00:22:03.980" style="s2">which is you know one of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.090" end="00:22:06.380" style="s2">of these techniques is that the tunings</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.460" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s the genetic algorithm could</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">you explain to us how you extended the</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:27.529" style="s2">program well as I said I got Holland&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.830" end="00:22:30.230" style="s2">book in 1976 but I was the founder and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.529" end="00:22:32.270" style="s2">CEO of a company that I was running at</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.230" end="00:22:35.149" style="s2">the time to someone lottery tickets to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.270" end="00:22:39.940" style="s2">state governments so I was quite busy</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.149" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">and I was sort of followed Pelham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.940" end="00:22:46.070" style="s2">achievements with the genetic algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:49.070" style="s2">and all the other people who at the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.070" end="00:22:50.750" style="s2">and refined it and introduced all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.070" end="00:22:53.570" style="s2">technique Jim that you were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.750" end="00:22:55.399" style="s2">about different variations and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.570" end="00:22:59.149" style="s2">doing it but I was involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.399" end="00:23:02.750" style="s2">lottery business till 87 between 1973</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.149" end="00:23:05.960" style="s2">and 87 and this sort of an academic</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.750" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">interest of mine to be watching what was</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.960" end="00:23:10.610" style="s2">going on in this new field of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:15.020" style="s2">algorithms so I left the lottery</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.610" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">business in 87 and at that point I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.020" end="00:23:21.020" style="s2">as involved a little in venture capital</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.230" end="00:23:23.570" style="s2">but I got involved with some people in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.020" end="00:23:26.600" style="s2">Stanford University in the computer</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.570" end="00:23:28.760" style="s2">science department and got to talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.600" end="00:23:30.950" style="s2">them about genetic algorithms and said</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.760" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">well wouldn&#39;t it be nice that there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.950" end="00:23:36.169" style="s2">a course at Stanford University on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:38.740" style="s2">genetic algorithms so they appointed me</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.169" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">as a consulting a faculty member</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.740" end="00:23:43.990" style="s2">ultimately a consulting professor and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:47.419" style="s2">started teaching a course at Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.990" end="00:23:49.190" style="s2">starting in 88 which was just about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.419" end="00:23:52.250" style="s2">time when the genetic algorithm field</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.190" end="00:23:54.950" style="s2">was really starting to take off and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.250" end="00:23:56.980" style="s2">started to have conferences and public</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.950" end="00:23:59.149" style="s2">proceedings and lots of papers as</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.980" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">opposed to one or two papers a year</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.149" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">there would be you know a hundred papers</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:08.090" style="s2">a year in this growing field of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:11.090" style="s2">algorithms and of course what motivated</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.090" end="00:24:15.710" style="s2">me was still this memory of Freiburg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.090" end="00:24:17.929" style="s2">paper that I ran into in 1963 which was</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.710" end="00:24:21.470" style="s2">the notion that you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.929" end="00:24:22.309" style="s2">computer program itself mm now</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.470" end="00:24:25.730" style="s2">Freiburg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.309" end="00:24:27.320" style="s2">work was with binary strings and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.730" end="00:24:29.420" style="s2">could quickly see that by next</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.320" end="00:24:32.750" style="s2">not a particularly expressive way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.420" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">deal with a problem like this so I said</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.750" end="00:24:39.430" style="s2">why couldn&#39;t we apply the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:43.130" style="s2">algorithm to pull computer programs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.430" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">in particular hold computer programs in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.130" end="00:24:49.280" style="s2">lits which was simply a functional</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.820" end="00:24:52.130" style="s2">programming or tree like representation</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.280" end="00:24:55.250" style="s2">of program so if you&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.130" end="00:24:57.980" style="s2">addiction you have a function addition</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:25:01.580" style="s2">and two arguments and you add them</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.980" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">together and if one of those arguments</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.580" end="00:25:06.380" style="s2">do adding together was the product that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">stay multiplying two other numbers you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.380" end="00:25:13.640" style="s2">would have this tree of operations so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.190" end="00:25:16.030" style="s2">you can represent computer programs in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.640" end="00:25:19.400" style="s2">functional programming languages as</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.030" end="00:25:21.250" style="s2">program trees and the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.400" end="00:25:23.900" style="s2">about program trees is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.250" end="00:25:28.190" style="s2">automatically suggest to you the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.900" end="00:25:32.330" style="s2">regarding a portion of a large program</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.190" end="00:25:35.390" style="s2">tree as part of a genome and if the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.330" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">program tree is just a little good at</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.390" end="00:25:40.070" style="s2">solving a problem and you&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:41.810" style="s2">program tree over here that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.070" end="00:25:45.860" style="s2">little good at solving that same problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.810" end="00:25:50.360" style="s2">and you took a big chunk of one program</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.860" end="00:25:53.060" style="s2">tree from the father and another chunk</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.360" end="00:25:55.970" style="s2">of the program tree from the mother and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.060" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">you swapped those sub trees in effect</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.970" end="00:26:01.280" style="s2">you would be doing something like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">genetic algorithm does when it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.280" end="00:26:07.250" style="s2">portion of a binary string but you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">taking a coherent chunk of computer</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.250" end="00:26:13.610" style="s2">program and that&#39;s the notion behind</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:16.940" style="s2">genetic programming namely you start now</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.610" end="00:26:20.210" style="s2">with a population of a thousand randomly</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.940" end="00:26:22.040" style="s2">created binary strings of length 50 but</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:25.420" style="s2">you start out with a thousand computer</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.040" end="00:26:27.770" style="s2">programs each of which is a program tree</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.420" end="00:26:30.980" style="s2">containing multiplication and addition</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.770" end="00:26:35.270" style="s2">and conditional operations and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.980" end="00:26:37.790" style="s2">some cosines and Exponential&#39;s and some</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.270" end="00:26:40.580" style="s2">other things and you ask how good is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:40.909" style="s2">this program at solving the problem you</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.580" end="00:26:44.179" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.909" end="00:26:48.409" style="s2">how good is at doing a sorting algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.179" end="00:26:51.499" style="s2">how good is it at creating a polynomial</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.409" end="00:26:54.710" style="s2">that matches a given sample of data</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.499" end="00:26:57.019" style="s2">maybe the stock market data how good is</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:12.229" style="s2">reaching out and so forth so what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.349" end="00:27:14.599" style="s2">get by moving into the world of computer</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.229" end="00:27:17.450" style="s2">programs instead of binary strings is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.599" end="00:27:20.599" style="s2">much greater richness of expressiveness</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.450" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">because you can have operations that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.599" end="00:27:22.999" style="s2">much more meaningful</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.129" end="00:27:36.440" style="s2">individual no population would be much</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">more expressive and somehow it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.440" end="00:27:40.549" style="s2">intuitively makes sense that if this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:41.929" style="s2">program is somewhat good at solving the</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.540" end="00:29:40.740" style="s2">be applied to I mean what I remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.670" end="00:29:42.600" style="s2">from the relatively early days I think I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.740" end="00:29:45.630" style="s2">actually saw you present on this at</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.600" end="00:29:48.510" style="s2">Gecko was that you had had your genetic</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.630" end="00:29:50.970" style="s2">programming environments had discovered</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.510" end="00:29:52.890" style="s2">some analog circuits that had actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.970" end="00:29:55.170" style="s2">been patented could you talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.890" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">a little bit well yes so one of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.170" end="00:30:00.179" style="s2">things that interested me of course was</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.510" end="00:30:01.650" style="s2">doing what I would call the aim of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.179" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">course was to create some human</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.650" end="00:30:06.420" style="s2">competitive results with genetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:09.420" style="s2">programming and one of the categories</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.420" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve worked on a lot was analog circuit</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.420" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">design now there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:17.100" style="s2">algorithms for digital circuit designs</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:20.130" style="s2">but analog circuit design is an art as</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.100" end="00:30:22.650" style="s2">is antenna design and controller design</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.130" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">and frankly most engineering design</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.650" end="00:30:28.770" style="s2">problems are matter of art as well as</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:31.590" style="s2">mathematics and science so we said could</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.770" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">we use this to automatically create</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.590" end="00:30:36.290" style="s2">analog electrical circuits that was one</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">of the big projects we worked on and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.290" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">obviously you could use it on digital</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:44.190" style="s2">circuits that was quite straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:46.530" style="s2">but and the idea there was we we went</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.190" end="00:30:50.460" style="s2">back through the patent literature from</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.530" end="00:30:53.040" style="s2">the early 1910s and 20s when telephones</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.460" end="00:30:56.730" style="s2">was the leading technology and things</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.040" end="00:30:59.550" style="s2">like filters and amplifiers and feedback</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.730" end="00:31:01.650" style="s2">were big issues and we started saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.550" end="00:31:04.740" style="s2">well suppose we had a bunch of resistors</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.650" end="00:31:05.669" style="s2">and capacitors and inductors which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.740" end="00:31:08.879" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.669" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">at that time period and telephones could</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.879" end="00:31:15.659" style="s2">you get an automated process that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:17.879" style="s2">just combine these common ingredients to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.659" end="00:31:20.099" style="s2">produce circuits well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.879" end="00:31:22.469" style="s2">filtered well a loaf of pass filter is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.099" end="00:31:25.739" style="s2">like the woofer on your hi-fi you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.469" end="00:31:27.899" style="s2">passes the low frequency signals through</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.739" end="00:31:31.379" style="s2">it freely and it suppresses the high</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.899" end="00:31:35.070" style="s2">frequency signal well it turns out if</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.379" end="00:31:38.669" style="s2">you create a random population of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.070" end="00:31:42.299" style="s2">circuits and ask how good are these</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.669" end="00:31:44.339" style="s2">circuits at filtering a signal you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.299" end="00:31:47.070" style="s2">easily compute the fitness and see how</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.339" end="00:31:49.999" style="s2">well does it pass say frequencies from</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.070" end="00:31:52.619" style="s2">zero to a thousand and how well does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.999" end="00:31:55.049" style="s2">suppress frequencies from a thousand and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.619" end="00:31:57.509" style="s2">above so you can compute fitness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.049" end="00:32:00.179" style="s2">then you can start slightly mutating a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.509" end="00:32:03.119" style="s2">few and reproducing a few but more</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.179" end="00:32:05.759" style="s2">importantly crossing over circuits that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.119" end="00:32:08.820" style="s2">just do a little well at filtering with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.759" end="00:32:11.159" style="s2">each other and lo and behold we started</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.820" end="00:32:13.559" style="s2">evolving the Campbell filter which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.159" end="00:32:17.789" style="s2">the classic bladder filter of inductors</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.559" end="00:32:21.029" style="s2">and capacitors that was patented I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.789" end="00:32:23.249" style="s2">in 1917 if I recall and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.029" end="00:32:24.959" style="s2">there are all sorts of improved filters</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.249" end="00:32:26.849" style="s2">the Butterworth filters and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.959" end="00:32:30.570" style="s2">elliptical filters and the power filters</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.849" end="00:32:32.849" style="s2">and the M derived filters and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.570" end="00:32:35.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole johnson filters there</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.849" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">are a whole variety of filters that had</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.119" end="00:32:39.629" style="s2">particular additional characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:43.289" style="s2">they were very good at creating a steep</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.289" end="00:32:50.119" style="s2">uation or what-have-you and we were able</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.619" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">to reproduce about a half dozen of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.119" end="00:32:57.539" style="s2">filtered patents of the 1920s and 30s up</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.879" style="s2">including the elliptic filter which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.539" end="00:33:01.799" style="s2">an essentially one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.799" end="00:33:05.309" style="s2">programming and then we got involved</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.779" end="00:33:07.859" style="s2">with all kinds of other circuits who</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.309" end="00:33:10.289" style="s2">said well transistors were invented at</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.289" end="00:33:15.719" style="s2">don&#39;t we throw in transistors as well as</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.690" end="00:33:19.420" style="s2">resistors and capacitors and lo and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.719" end="00:33:22.090" style="s2">behold we started being able to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.420" end="00:33:25.050" style="s2">things that were patented in the 50s 60s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.090" end="00:33:28.750" style="s2">and 70s with transistors that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.050" end="00:33:31.870" style="s2">significant inventions not just novelty</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:35.650" style="s2">toy circuits and then what you may have</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.650" end="00:33:40.300" style="s2">millennium rock we found six patented</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.990" end="00:36:09.340" style="s2">created all sorts of interesting other</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.490" end="00:36:17.619" style="s2">again just an underline for our audience</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.859" end="00:36:20.290" style="s2">all these things were done untouched by</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.619" end="00:36:22.450" style="s2">human hands it was not like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.290" end="00:36:24.130" style="s2">high priced computer guys sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.450" end="00:36:27.130" style="s2">wrote this stuff these things were</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.130" end="00:36:28.570" style="s2">evolved which is amazing and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.130" end="00:36:30.130" style="s2">mentioned on the intro actually been</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.570" end="00:36:32.109" style="s2">involved in two companies that use</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.130" end="00:36:34.600" style="s2">genetic programming I was chairman of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.109" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">analog design automation which used</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.600" end="00:36:40.030" style="s2">genetic programming to improve human</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:41.890" style="s2">designed analog circuits and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.030" end="00:36:44.050" style="s2">our lead investor was Intel we had all</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.890" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">the big chip companies as our customers</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.050" end="00:36:47.800" style="s2">we ended up selling the company for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:50.290" style="s2">nice price my bus they say so to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.800" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">synopsis and then we had another company</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.290" end="00:36:54.430" style="s2">called cielito design automation which</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">used genetic programming and and other</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:37:01.510" style="s2">ability of computer chips and again that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.230" end="00:37:03.910" style="s2">company was very successful and was sold</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.510" end="00:37:06.100" style="s2">to Siemens not too long ago so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.910" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">are some real world really hard problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.100" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">that GP has been applied to John do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">keep up on the state of the art and GP</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:15.010" style="s2">and do you know of what&#39;s going on on</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:17.220" style="s2">the cutting edge these days well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.010" end="00:37:21.130" style="s2">been staying closely involved with the</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.730" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">and every every year they run a</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:34.619" style="s2">human competitive things that have been</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.180" end="00:37:50.980" style="s2">there have been a whole string of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.220" end="00:37:56.170" style="s2">impressive results every year and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.980" end="00:37:59.490" style="s2">people go to wwhen - competitive that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.170" end="00:38:02.290" style="s2">org they can look at the progression of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.490" end="00:38:04.780" style="s2">increasingly impressive things that have</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.290" end="00:38:07.240" style="s2">won prizes over the last twenty or so</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:09.540" style="s2">years cool could you call out a couple</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.240" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">that you were impressed by recently I</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.540" end="00:38:15.820" style="s2">personally was very impressed with Lee</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:20.050" style="s2">specters worked on quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.820" end="00:38:22.390" style="s2">circuits and moshi sippers repeated</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.390" end="00:38:27.640" style="s2">of won prizes in that competition in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.850" end="00:38:29.500" style="s2">area of game playing but there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.640" end="00:38:32.620" style="s2">just a whole number of other ones I</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.500" end="00:38:35.230" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to slide anybody else by</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.620" end="00:38:37.840" style="s2">having mentioned those - ah very good</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.230" end="00:38:40.330" style="s2">what an amazing idea you&#39;ve had John and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.840" end="00:38:43.510" style="s2">how far it&#39;s gone and so now let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.330" end="00:38:46.770" style="s2">on to the third area of innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.510" end="00:38:49.690" style="s2">this is the national popular vote</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.770" end="00:38:51.160" style="s2">initiative could you start by telling us</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.690" end="00:38:53.530" style="s2">about it that&#39;s kind of a high level</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.160" end="00:38:55.060" style="s2">what the motivation was but then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.530" end="00:38:57.400" style="s2">ask you some more questions we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.060" end="00:39:00.370" style="s2">into some more detail well again that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.400" end="00:39:02.140" style="s2">goes back to my very busy career as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.370" end="00:39:04.650" style="s2">graduate student at University of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:07.480" style="s2">Michigan in the 60s so very busy on</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.650" end="00:39:10.540" style="s2">frankly everything but my thesis for</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.480" end="00:39:13.810" style="s2">most of the years I was in Ann Arbor so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.540" end="00:39:16.360" style="s2">I was had this significant part-time job</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.810" end="00:39:19.810" style="s2">of programming for the game company</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.360" end="00:39:22.200" style="s2">while I was working on my thesis but of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.810" end="00:39:25.180" style="s2">course graduate students Lana now were</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.200" end="00:39:27.370" style="s2">very occupied with playing games as any</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.180" end="00:39:31.180" style="s2">previous graduate student well knows and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.370" end="00:39:34.300" style="s2">in the sixties a very complicated board</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.180" end="00:39:36.970" style="s2">games were very much the rage the Avalon</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.300" end="00:39:38.680" style="s2">Hill war games and an Avalon Hill had a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.970" end="00:39:41.710" style="s2">number of other complicated games</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.680" end="00:39:44.470" style="s2">involving railroad switch yards and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.710" end="00:39:45.340" style="s2">there was diplomacy and risk and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.470" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">bunch of games</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.340" end="00:39:51.700" style="s2">Stratego but we got interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:53.620" style="s2">creating our own game so it created a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.700" end="00:39:57.100" style="s2">game based on the electoral college</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.620" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2">which was a topic of quite prominent</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.100" end="00:40:02.140" style="s2">debate in the 60s so we had this game</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:04.630" style="s2">that John Holland played with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.140" end="00:40:07.870" style="s2">graduate students we had a computer</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.630" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">program that would run simultaneous with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.870" end="00:40:11.800" style="s2">playing the game creating different</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.230" style="s2">statistical matrices so we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.800" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">evaluate the state of the play at each</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.230" end="00:40:18.760" style="s2">stage and we would pretend to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:21.970" style="s2">presidential campus campaigning for</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.760" end="00:40:25.120" style="s2">president using the quarks and oddities</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.970" end="00:40:28.600" style="s2">of the electoral college so this game</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.120" end="00:40:31.300" style="s2">was called consensus which we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.600" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">published commercially lost the money on</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.300" end="00:40:37.900" style="s2">and sold 3,000 copies but this game was</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:41.260" style="s2">sort of always in the back of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.900" end="00:40:44.470" style="s2">how utterly ridiculous the electoral</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.260" end="00:40:46.990" style="s2">college is as a method for choosing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.470" end="00:40:49.330" style="s2">president and how subject it is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.990" end="00:40:54.010" style="s2">manipulation and producing odd results</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.330" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">so in the 90s and 2000&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.010" end="00:41:01.410" style="s2">2004 election it had become increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">clear that presidential campaigns had</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.410" end="00:41:07.330" style="s2">concentrated only on a handful of states</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:10.780" style="s2">when Kennedy ran in 60 he campaigned in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.330" end="00:41:13.870" style="s2">35 states and Nixon campaigned in all 50</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.780" end="00:41:17.260" style="s2">when Kerry and Bush were campaigning in</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.870" end="00:41:19.510" style="s2">2004 almost the entire campaign law</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.260" end="00:41:21.640" style="s2">virtually the entire campaign was in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.510" end="00:41:23.740" style="s2">dozen states but essentially the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.640" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">campaign was in three stick and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.740" end="00:41:28.810" style="s2">because under the current system the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.440" end="00:41:30.850" style="s2">candidate who gets the most votes inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.810" end="00:41:35.380" style="s2">each state gets all of the state&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.850" end="00:41:39.460" style="s2">electoral votes so if a state is 5% or</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:43.240" style="s2">6% in one direction it&#39;s really out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.460" end="00:41:45.850" style="s2">reach during a presidential three-month</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.240" end="00:41:48.970" style="s2">campaign so if you&#39;re running for</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.850" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">president and you want to win you do all</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.970" end="00:41:53.500" style="s2">your campaigning in the states that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:55.510" style="s2">within one or two or three percent the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.500" end="00:41:59.890" style="s2">so-called swing states or battleground</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.510" end="00:42:02.730" style="s2">state and this battleground that had</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.890" end="00:42:07.150" style="s2">been fairly large in the 40s 50s and 60s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.730" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">had shrunk by 2004 to just a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.150" end="00:42:13.450" style="s2">states which is of course still the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:15.369" style="s2">today and the result is not only</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.450" end="00:42:16.839" style="s2">most of the people in United States are</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.369" end="00:42:18.820" style="s2">politically irrelevant in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.839" end="00:42:21.880" style="s2">presidential election in the general</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.820" end="00:42:24.550" style="s2">election but you could also get</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.880" end="00:42:26.380" style="s2">candidates elected president who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.550" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">get the most votes in all 50 states</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.380" end="00:42:33.550" style="s2">which of course occurred in 2000 and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:35.349" style="s2">then more recently in 2016 and just in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.550" end="00:42:37.900" style="s2">general obviously every vote was not</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.349" end="00:42:42.700" style="s2">equal and most voters were just</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.900" end="00:42:46.690" style="s2">politically irrelevant so it turned out</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.700" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">I have lost a 25-cent bet when I was an</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.690" end="00:42:52.599" style="s2">undergraduate to a pre-law student in</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:56.290" style="s2">the dorm at Michigan I had claimed that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.599" end="00:42:58.990" style="s2">the winner-take-all rule was in the US</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.290" end="00:43:01.990" style="s2">Constitution and the law student said no</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.990" end="00:43:05.140" style="s2">no no it&#39;s not in the Constitution and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.990" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">did lose the bet and I still remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.140" end="00:43:10.180" style="s2">that because he was right it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.609" style="s2">the way we elect the president isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:15.849" style="s2">really in the Constitution it&#39;s in state</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.460" end="00:43:50.380" style="s2">of the process of lobbying state</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.530" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">legislatures and passing laws by</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">at lunch and said why couldn&#39;t you elect</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.390" end="00:44:01.180" style="s2">the president in a national popular vote</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:02.740" style="s2">not by amending the Constitution but</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.180" end="00:44:05.530" style="s2">just by changing these state</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.740" end="00:44:08.230" style="s2">winner-take-all laws and we started</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.530" end="00:44:10.300" style="s2">researching this and quickly discovered</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.230" end="00:44:12.970" style="s2">that well not only was the pre-law</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.630" end="00:44:21.069" style="s2">it turns out that the way to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.869" style="s2">with the states getting together with</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.069" end="00:44:25.270" style="s2">what are called interstate compacts</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.830" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">new things and usually a state enters an</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.540" end="00:45:16.210" style="s2">legislation which we introduced in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:19.840" style="s2">book in 2006 and we started going around</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.210" end="00:45:22.180" style="s2">to different states trying to get them</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.840" end="00:45:25.570" style="s2">to pass this law and Maryland was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.180" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">first state to enact in 2007 so thank</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.570" end="00:45:30.700" style="s2">you Jim for being a Maryland person and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:33.940" style="s2">being part of getting national popular</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.700" end="00:45:36.210" style="s2">vote started and we went into this</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.210" end="00:45:42.190" style="s2">started lobbying state legislators and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.340" end="00:45:44.050" style="s2">one by one we got legislators to start</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.190" end="00:45:48.070" style="s2">passing this usually about one a year</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.050" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">until 2019 when we got four states in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.070" end="00:45:53.500" style="s2">one year and now we&#39;re in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:56.980" style="s2">we have 15 states in the District of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.500" end="00:45:59.170" style="s2">Columbia with 196 electoral votes that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.980" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">have passed this interstate compact and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.170" end="00:46:04.330" style="s2">it will go into effect when states</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:08.140" style="s2">having half the electoral votes which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.330" end="00:46:11.160" style="s2">270 out of 538 passed the same block and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.140" end="00:46:14.530" style="s2">we&#39;re working to get the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.160" end="00:46:17.650" style="s2">states which would be we need states</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.530" end="00:46:20.710" style="s2">with 74 more electoral votes to get to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.650" end="00:46:23.320" style="s2">to 7 ah yeah wow what an amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.710" end="00:46:25.300" style="s2">audacious thing all starting from a game</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.320" end="00:46:27.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting I was another one</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.300" end="00:46:28.990" style="s2">of those people that loved Avalon Hill</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.250" end="00:46:31.660" style="s2">games back they started playing</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.990" end="00:46:33.070" style="s2">yeah tactics too when I was 9 at a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.660" end="00:46:35.740" style="s2">friend&#39;s house and I actually bought</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.070" end="00:46:37.900" style="s2">used the copy of stalingrad when I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.740" end="00:46:40.150" style="s2">10 and became a hell of a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.900" end="00:46:40.570" style="s2">stalingrad player and played many of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.150" end="00:46:43.150" style="s2">rest</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.570" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">then even more humorously I later made a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.150" end="00:46:47.260" style="s2">small investment in the avalon hill</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:49.120" style="s2">company which was publicly traded and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.260" end="00:46:50.530" style="s2">added to it and added to it stock never</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.120" end="00:46:53.980" style="s2">did well the company was horribly</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.530" end="00:46:56.050" style="s2">unprofitable run very badly by a couple</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.980" end="00:46:58.690" style="s2">of clowns who had bought it but I got</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.050" end="00:47:00.670" style="s2">the meet Curt Schilling because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.690" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">turned out that he and I were the two</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.670" end="00:47:07.120" style="s2">largest non insider shareholders and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:09.610" style="s2">conspired together to try to buy the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.120" end="00:47:11.380" style="s2">company one time but didn&#39;t work out but</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.610" end="00:47:13.840" style="s2">we ended up making some money when the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.380" end="00:47:15.340" style="s2">company was acquired by Hasbro I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.840" end="00:47:17.470" style="s2">it was or one of the big game companies</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.340" end="00:47:19.780" style="s2">but anyway a little interesting history</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.470" end="00:47:21.970" style="s2">on games but now let&#39;s get back on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.780" end="00:47:24.310" style="s2">popular vote could you explain a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.970" end="00:47:25.990" style="s2">bit about what a state compact is you</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.310" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">kind of touched on it and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.990" end="00:47:31.930" style="s2">more specifically what&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:33.910" style="s2">proposed state compact well yes so let</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.930" end="00:47:36.280" style="s2">me first connect the interstate compacts</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.910" end="00:47:40.200" style="s2">with the lotteries because the reason we</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.280" end="00:47:43.150" style="s2">thought of this is that in the mid-80s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.200" end="00:47:46.150" style="s2">lotto games were getting started with</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.150" end="00:47:49.690" style="s2">state lotteries and lotto games offered</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.150" end="00:47:51.490" style="s2">a very large prize as you know and some</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.690" end="00:47:53.620" style="s2">of the smaller states have Maine New</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">Hampshire and Vermont because they had</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.620" end="00:47:58.360" style="s2">so few people they couldn&#39;t run a lotto</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:01.000" style="s2">game the way New York or New Jersey</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.360" end="00:48:03.850" style="s2">could with a big multi-million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.000" end="00:48:06.370" style="s2">prize so they got together and passed an</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:09.850" style="s2">interstate compact creating the Tri</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.370" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">State lotto Commission and that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.850" end="00:48:15.550" style="s2">became aware of interstate compact and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:18.550" style="s2">as it turned out my company scientific</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.550" end="00:48:21.220" style="s2">games won the first contract to run a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.550" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">lotto gate for the tri-state a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.220" end="00:48:26.830" style="s2">commission that was our first contract</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:28.750" style="s2">for a lotto game our specialty being</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.830" end="00:48:31.990" style="s2">instant games but we were branching out</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.750" end="00:48:35.100" style="s2">into a lot of games so I became aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.990" end="00:48:37.530" style="s2">the idea of an interstate compact and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.100" end="00:48:40.690" style="s2">also became aware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.530" end="00:48:43.690" style="s2">Congress usually doesn&#39;t have to consent</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.690" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">to States entering into interstate</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.690" end="00:48:49.150" style="s2">compacts now many times Congress does</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.910" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">have to consent but we had looked into</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.150" end="00:48:53.290" style="s2">it as a legal matter because when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.300" style="s2">were in the press of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.290" end="00:48:56.830" style="s2">bidding on the contract we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.300" end="00:48:59.110" style="s2">scratching our head wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.830" end="00:49:01.540" style="s2">this tri-state lotto</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.110" end="00:49:04.150" style="s2">Commission was a legal entity and</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.540" end="00:49:06.760" style="s2">actually had any legal authority to run</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.150" end="00:49:09.340" style="s2">this game or give us a contract and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.760" end="00:49:12.460" style="s2">turns out that if the topic does not</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.340" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">threaten federal supremacy the states</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.460" end="00:49:17.500" style="s2">can enter into a compact without</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:19.360" style="s2">congressional consent and gambling was</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.500" end="00:49:21.720" style="s2">considered something that did not</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.360" end="00:49:23.800" style="s2">threaten federal supremacy because</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.720" end="00:49:25.450" style="s2">Congress basically took the position</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.800" end="00:49:28.390" style="s2">that as far as they were concerned</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.450" end="00:49:31.300" style="s2">gambling is illegal and similarly</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.390" end="00:49:33.190" style="s2">because the Constitution specifically</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.300" end="00:49:35.050" style="s2">gives the state legislatures the power</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.190" end="00:49:38.140" style="s2">to decide how to award their electoral</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.050" end="00:49:40.360" style="s2">votes this is another area where an</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.140" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">interstate compact would not require</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.360" end="00:49:44.770" style="s2">congressional consent not that we were</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:47.950" style="s2">against having congressional consent but</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.770" end="00:49:51.340" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s another step and we were</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.950" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">pleased to discover that at least based</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.340" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">on existing judicial precedents a</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.150" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">compact that involves some exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.130" style="s2">state power doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:02.410" style="s2">congressional percent so to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.130" end="00:50:05.950" style="s2">question Jim how does the compact work</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.410" end="00:50:09.190" style="s2">it says basically Delaware which one of</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.869" end="00:54:40.069" style="s2">arrived so we went through a period when</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.299" end="00:54:42.650" style="s2">we started getting a lot of Republican</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.069" end="00:54:46.299" style="s2">support passed the Oklahoma stun Atwoods</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.650" end="00:54:48.650" style="s2">probably controlled the Arizona House</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.430" end="00:55:05.900" style="s2">York was that the republican-controlled</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.839" end="00:55:07.849" style="s2">Senate passed it so we went through a</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.849" end="00:55:13.490" style="s2">increasing and then of course we had the</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.490" end="00:55:18.529" style="s2">of like a square-dance everybody changed</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.559" end="00:55:21.230" style="s2">party lines and all of a sudden the</p>

<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:34.520" style="s2">sudden the Democrats said oh my goodness</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.610" end="00:56:14.420" style="s2">hundred thousand votes had switched in</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.509" end="00:58:55.219" style="s2">answer was a lot so what happens if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.549" end="00:58:57.170" style="s2">do have a really really really close one</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.219" end="00:58:59.180" style="s2">so close that if it were to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.170" end="00:59:00.650" style="s2">happened at a state level we could</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.180" end="00:59:03.619" style="s2">demand a recount</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.650" end="00:59:05.719" style="s2">you know for instance in 1960 it was 0.1</p>

<p begin="00:59:13.279" end="00:59:19.670" style="s2">1% threshold and often at 0.5 percent</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.210" end="00:59:22.819" style="s2">there&#39;s the ability to demand a recount</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.670" end="00:59:26.989" style="s2">how in the world could we do a national</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.390" end="00:59:36.650" style="s2">the interstate compact well the reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.579" end="00:59:39.319" style="s2">is you can&#39;t do a recount now in</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.650" end="00:59:43.269" style="s2">presidential elections you recall there</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.319" end="00:59:46.819" style="s2">was no recount in 2000 even though the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.269" end="00:59:50.599" style="s2">difference of the state level was 537</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.819" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">votes and 537 votes determined who was</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.599" end="00:59:55.969" style="s2">President of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:59.450" style="s2">there was no recount in Pennsylvania or</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.969" end="01:00:01.940" style="s2">Michigan in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.450" end="01:00:04.040" style="s2">simply because the claim is in 2000 the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.940" end="01:00:07.130" style="s2">candidate who was initially had went</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.040" end="01:00:09.890" style="s2">into court and found a technicality and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.130" end="01:00:12.349" style="s2">ran the clock out and the key point is</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.890" end="01:00:15.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a clock on this recount because</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.349" end="01:00:19.700" style="s2">of the 20th amendment which move the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.349" end="01:00:22.549" style="s2">inauguration from March 4th to January</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.700" end="01:00:27.099" style="s2">20th there&#39;s only 7 weeks between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.549" end="01:00:30.470" style="s2">election and the inauguration and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.099" end="01:00:32.030" style="s2">there&#39;s actually only a few weeks in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.470" end="01:00:33.380" style="s2">practical sense because it takes a</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.030" end="01:00:36.650" style="s2">couple of weeks to create the first</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.380" end="01:00:39.500" style="s2">count so the other practical</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.650" end="01:00:41.900" style="s2">consideration is most state laws don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.500" end="01:00:44.839" style="s2">actually work to let you have a retail</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.900" end="01:00:47.720" style="s2">take Ohio which is intestinal</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.839" end="01:00:50.809" style="s2">battleground state and turns out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.720" end="01:00:51.349" style="s2">a 15-day waiting period in their recount</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.809" end="01:00:55.250" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.349" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">well between November 4th and December</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.250" end="01:01:01.790" style="s2">12th you just don&#39;t have 15 days to wait</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:03.859" style="s2">to start the court proceedings after</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.790" end="01:01:06.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve spent two or three weeks with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.859" end="01:01:08.650" style="s2">count so the first problem is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.190" end="01:01:11.569" style="s2">effectively there are no recounts</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.650" end="01:01:13.460" style="s2">practically possible right now in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.569" end="01:01:15.589" style="s2">presidential elections secondly they</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.460" end="01:01:17.750" style="s2">would be much less frequent and national</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.589" end="01:01:20.150" style="s2">popular vote the threshold is not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.750" end="01:01:24.770" style="s2">tenth of one percent the number of votes</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.150" end="01:01:27.230" style="s2">changed in a recount is about 300 at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.770" end="01:01:30.470" style="s2">state level and that&#39;s based on actual</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.230" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">statistics of the 28 recounts over the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.470" end="01:01:38.359" style="s2">last 20 years and the chance of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:42.680" style="s2">recount is 1 in 200 so if we ran 200</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.359" end="01:01:44.750" style="s2">presidential elections yes once in 800</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.680" end="01:01:46.490" style="s2">years you would be close enough to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.750" end="01:01:50.510" style="s2">warrant a recount</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.490" end="01:01:53.540" style="s2">these recounts that occur in some states</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.510" end="01:01:55.339" style="s2">when there&#39;s a 1% gap our public</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.540" end="01:01:58.819" style="s2">relations recounts they&#39;re designed to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.339" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">is fill public confidence but 1% of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.819" end="01:02:03.260" style="s2">votes do not change in any recount at</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">least any recount that I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.260" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">certainly none in the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:11.299" style="s2">where the average recap change in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:12.599" style="s2">recount is 300 votes and we&#39;re 6 out of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.299" end="01:02:15.660" style="s2">7 Rica</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.599" end="01:02:17.609" style="s2">simply reaffirm the previous results but</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.660" end="01:02:19.680" style="s2">to answer your alternate question how</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.609" end="01:02:22.829" style="s2">would you run a recount you you need a</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.680" end="01:02:25.019" style="s2">national recount law and we wrote one</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.829" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">and put one on our book which is more</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.019" end="01:02:29.009" style="s2">needed under the current system that</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">would be needed under national popular</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.009" end="01:02:34.380" style="s2">vote because the current system creates</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:36.599" style="s2">50 opportunities for recount every four</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.380" end="01:02:39.630" style="s2">years whereas we would create only one</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.599" end="01:02:42.529" style="s2">opportunity for recount or for years but</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.630" end="01:02:45.809" style="s2">we do need a right to recount that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.529" end="01:02:49.670" style="s2">unconditional and can&#39;t be brushed aside</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.809" end="01:02:52.289" style="s2">with delaying tactics and self-serving</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.670" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">running out the clock which is what what</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.289" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">occurs now so recount is a messy area</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:02:59.239" style="s2">all I would say is things would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:01.710" style="s2">better under national popular vote</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.239" end="01:03:03.720" style="s2">because there would be less probability</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.710" end="01:03:06.630" style="s2">of having a recount in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.720" end="01:03:08.369" style="s2">that seemed reasonable but if we did</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.630" end="01:03:10.039" style="s2">have one early without the national</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.369" end="01:03:13.049" style="s2">recount law we&#39;d have a serious problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.039" end="01:03:14.549" style="s2">well of course you would but the reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.049" end="01:03:17.150" style="s2">is you have a serious problem now</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.549" end="01:03:20.869" style="s2">because if there was a close vote</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.150" end="01:03:23.309" style="s2">nationally remember there are 12 of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.869" end="01:03:26.269" style="s2">50 states are closely divided</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.309" end="01:03:29.630" style="s2">battleground states there would also be</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.269" end="01:03:32.940" style="s2">probably 12 states that are closed and</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.630" end="01:03:34.529" style="s2">you have recounts there that&#39;s a good</p>

<p begin="01:04:45.109" end="01:04:51.079" style="s2">popular vote went strongly the other way</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.079" end="01:04:57.289" style="s2">at least strongly arguable that the US</p>

<p begin="01:05:22.760" end="01:05:28.430" style="s2">problem first of all the state</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.849" end="01:05:35.510" style="s2">substantial but it&#39;s limited by other</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.079" end="01:05:37.460" style="s2">provisions of the Constitution notably</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.510" end="01:05:40.730" style="s2">the fact that interstate compacts are</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.460" end="01:05:43.789" style="s2">contracts and the Constitution prohibits</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.730" end="01:05:46.510" style="s2">a state from impairing an obligation of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.789" end="01:05:49.880" style="s2">contract so it&#39;s really airtight</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.510" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">constitutional law that no state can get</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.880" end="01:05:54.230" style="s2">out of an interstate compact except in</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:58.910" style="s2">the manner that the compact itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.230" end="01:06:02.599" style="s2">allows and our compact says if you try</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.910" end="01:06:05.089" style="s2">to leave between July 20th and January</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.599" end="01:06:07.700" style="s2">20th of a presidential year your</p>

<p begin="01:06:07.700" end="01:06:12.680" style="s2">of the new president and there&#39;s been no</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.460" end="01:06:15.470" style="s2">case where the Supreme Court&#39;s or any</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.680" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">Court has ever allowed any state to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.470" end="01:06:19.760" style="s2">wiggle out of any under state compact</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:22.730" style="s2">ever and so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.760" end="01:06:25.490" style="s2">also there&#39;s a federal law on top of it</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.730" end="01:06:28.579" style="s2">which requires that presidential</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.490" end="01:06:32.869" style="s2">electors be selected based on laws in</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.579" end="01:06:36.049" style="s2">place prior to election day so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.869" end="01:06:39.140" style="s2">also a statutory reason why that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.049" end="01:06:39.740" style="s2">happen and in a practical sense it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.140" end="01:06:42.470" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.740" end="01:06:45.470" style="s2">because most state legislators are not</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.470" end="01:06:48.850" style="s2">in session in that short period and even</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.470" end="01:06:53.150" style="s2">if they were most state constitutions</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.850" end="01:06:57.130" style="s2">only let a new law take effect 60 or 90</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.150" end="01:07:00.740" style="s2">or a hundred days after it gets passed</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.130" end="01:07:02.840" style="s2">so wouldn&#39;t even matter if there were no</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.740" end="01:07:05.840" style="s2">impairments cause there were no federal</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.840" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">statute even if all the legislators were</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.840" end="01:07:10.700" style="s2">in session most states could not pass a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:13.040" style="s2">law that would go into effect quickly</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.700" end="01:07:14.420" style="s2">enough to renege even if it was possible</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.040" end="01:07:16.040" style="s2">though of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.420" end="01:07:19.130" style="s2">Florida actually was going down that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.040" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">road to do so in the 2000 election well</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.130" end="01:07:23.869" style="s2">actually they weren&#39;t what Florida was</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:28.550" style="s2">doing was they were passing a resolution</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.869" end="01:07:31.640" style="s2">saying that if the courts vacated the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.550" end="01:07:36.080" style="s2">results of the vote by the people on</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.640" end="01:07:39.320" style="s2">November 3rd or whenever it was then the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.080" end="01:07:42.080" style="s2">legislature was reaffirming the choice</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.320" end="01:07:45.140" style="s2">of the Republicans slate of presidential</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.080" end="01:07:47.270" style="s2">electors but only if a court had done</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.140" end="01:07:49.510" style="s2">that so if you actually look under the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.270" end="01:07:52.520" style="s2">hood of what was going on in Florida in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.510" end="01:07:55.820" style="s2">2000 they weren&#39;t coming in and saying</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.520" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">we have the power after election day to</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.820" end="01:08:00.619" style="s2">override our own voters they does not</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">have that power because of the federal</p>

<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:07.040" style="s2">just learned something new there that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.609" end="01:08:08.770" style="s2">sounds pretty damn solid now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.040" end="01:08:12.260" style="s2">getting out of the kind of hard</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.770" end="01:08:15.470" style="s2">machinery aspects and more - is it good</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.260" end="01:08:20.120" style="s2">you know could a national popular vote</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.470" end="01:08:21.940" style="s2">result in more polarization suppose you</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.120" end="01:08:24.830" style="s2">know today the electoral college system</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.940" end="01:08:26.900" style="s2">requires people to compete in some of</p>

<p begin="01:08:26.900" end="01:08:32.990" style="s2">you can&#39;t go too far afield and win in</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.140" end="01:08:35.089" style="s2">Ohio or Wisconsin or Florida or</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.990" end="01:08:37.370" style="s2">Pennsylvania we went to a national</p>

<p begin="01:09:00.409" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">battleground states is simply the same</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.329" end="01:09:39.980" style="s2">party and our related question is you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.150" end="01:09:42.380" style="s2">know would candidates campaign only in</p>

<p begin="01:09:42.380" end="01:09:49.219" style="s2">we hear very often so we&#39;ve looked at</p>

<p begin="01:11:59.200" end="01:12:02.710" style="s2">like you guys have done the work and you</p>

<p begin="01:12:22.120" end="01:12:25.960" style="s2">two more objections that you regularly</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.800" end="01:12:28.510" style="s2">hear that you feel like you&#39;ve got good</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.960" end="01:12:32.230" style="s2">answers for well we think we have good</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.230" end="01:12:37.150" style="s2">book we actually cataloged all of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.230" end="01:12:39.340" style="s2">things that different people have said</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.150" end="01:12:41.290" style="s2">and we think we&#39;ve got a good answer for</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.340" end="01:12:44.950" style="s2">all of them but one of the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.290" end="01:12:48.160" style="s2">comes up quite often is it&#39;s an argument</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.950" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">to call it federalism it&#39;s somehow an</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.160" end="01:12:52.920" style="s2">uneasy feeling that some others are</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:55.990" style="s2">going to upset the federal system and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.920" end="01:12:58.210" style="s2">you really have to look at it though we</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.990" end="01:13:00.490" style="s2">do have a good system we divide power</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.210" end="01:13:03.340" style="s2">between states and the national</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.490" end="01:13:05.830" style="s2">government and that&#39;s not only allows</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.340" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">for innovation at the state level and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.830" end="01:13:11.290" style="s2">experimentation but it also prevents one</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.560" style="s2">party from ever getting a foothold for</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.290" end="01:13:16.870" style="s2">example suppose the Constitution said</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.560" end="01:13:18.580" style="s2">that the states legislatures didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.870" end="01:13:20.380" style="s2">control how the president was elected</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.580" end="01:13:22.270" style="s2">but Congress did that</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.380" end="01:13:24.699" style="s2">be a fairly natural way of writing a</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.270" end="01:13:26.590" style="s2">constitution and in fact that is the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.699" end="01:13:28.690" style="s2">it&#39;s done in many countries because</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.590" end="01:13:30.850" style="s2">there is no federal system with states</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.690" end="01:13:33.610" style="s2">with meaningful amounts of power then</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.850" end="01:13:35.620" style="s2">you&#39;d have an election system where the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.610" end="01:13:38.889" style="s2">party and power would write the election</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.620" end="01:13:41.860" style="s2">rules and anybody in power can think of</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.889" end="01:13:44.620" style="s2">ways of changing the election rules to</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.860" end="01:13:47.050" style="s2">keep themselves in power so you have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.620" end="01:13:49.420" style="s2">dispersal of power well there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.050" end="01:13:50.889" style="s2">about how you elect presidential</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.420" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">electors whether you elect them by a</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.889" end="01:13:56.260" style="s2">congressional district or state level or</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">national that in any way increases or</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.260" end="01:14:00.969" style="s2">decreases the amount of power that state</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:04.389" style="s2">government has or the national</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.969" end="01:14:06.969" style="s2">government has so an argument we often</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.389" end="01:14:09.699" style="s2">hear but it reflects sort of a natural</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.969" end="01:14:12.460" style="s2">concern a legitimate concern but for</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.699" end="01:14:14.320" style="s2">which is a good an argument is this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.460" end="01:14:16.360" style="s2">not something that&#39;s changing the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.320" end="01:14:18.850" style="s2">structural amount of power that</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.360" end="01:14:21.070" style="s2">different levels of government have say</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.850" end="01:14:24.670" style="s2">way of changing the way you&#39;re counting</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.070" end="01:14:26.860" style="s2">votes and we get a lot of that and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.670" end="01:14:29.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s not really very convincing</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.860" end="01:14:31.139" style="s2">okay you said you had one other one well</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.110" end="01:14:33.400" style="s2">we have a hundred thirty-one other ones</p>
