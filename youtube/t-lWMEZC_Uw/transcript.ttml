<p begin="00:00:53.000" end="00:00:58.630" style="s2">Jordan thank you so much for giving us some time again. I&#39;m in Sydney. You&#39;re in Kentucky. Yes, I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.630" end="00:01:01.929" style="s2">I&#39;m there as part of my 12 rules for life tour</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.930" end="00:01:07.540" style="s2">Which is I think expanding to hit about maybe 80 cities something like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.390" end="00:01:16.089" style="s2">Goodness. Well, that was very keen to have a follow-up chat after the conversation that you and I had together when you&#39;re in Sydney</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.150" end="00:01:22.120" style="s2">And in particular to frame that for people who might be listening this conversation at that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.120" end="00:01:25.479" style="s2">I had not seen you in front of a live audience</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">The evening of that conversation after that conversation. I had that opportunity at Chatswood one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.619" end="00:01:37.479" style="s2">seven talks that you gave in Australia put together by Sam McClelland from</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:41.020" style="s2">From Melbourne every one of them are sellout</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.479" end="00:01:49.359" style="s2">I have to say I don&#39;t know whether the biggest issue for me is what I learnt by watching that all the questions that arise</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.850" end="00:01:50.890" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.890" end="00:01:54.040" style="s2">But the first thing I&#39;d say is I was concerned at the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.350" end="00:01:58.660" style="s2">That you and I had had a very long conversation that it might be too long for people when we put it on the website</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.660" end="00:02:04.869" style="s2">And you said no John? It won&#39;t be young people especially are hungry for content. Put it all up there</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.940" end="00:02:09.219" style="s2">They will listen to it. You&#39;re absolutely right young people looking for content</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.490" end="00:02:16.569" style="s2">It&#39;s it is absolutely amazing. Yes. Well, I mean some of the big YouTube stars like Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">They&#39;re they&#39;re constantly putting out three-hour podcasts and people listen to all of them long-haul truckers</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:28.929" style="s2">listen to them and guys driving forklifts and and young people and and couples and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.180" end="00:02:34.030" style="s2">Like there&#39;s a massive hunger for real for ready for high-quality educational material</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.040" end="00:02:35.930" style="s2">It shouldn&#39;t be underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.930" end="00:02:42.520" style="s2">and I mean one of the things that seems to be the case with these people on YouTube that are making a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.490" end="00:02:46.809" style="s2">splash let&#39;s say in this alternate media format is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.180" end="00:02:53.650" style="s2">they fully they have full respect for the or the intelligence of their audience and they don&#39;t pull any punches in terms of content or</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.650" end="00:02:54.410" style="s2">length</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.410" end="00:02:56.559" style="s2">Yeah, well, that&#39;s where they come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:58.569" style="s2">but but as I say, you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.569" end="00:03:04.089" style="s2">It&#39;s just extraordinary I pull up in a fuel station out in a country town near where I live</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.459" end="00:03:07.859" style="s2">And somebody gets out of the car next to me father of about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.170" end="00:03:12.660" style="s2">35 I suppose he looks at me and he just says straight up before even says hello</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:16.619" style="s2">he said I&#39;ve just been listening to you and Jordan Peterson having a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:23.820" style="s2">Everywhere I go now. That&#39;s what people say. So thank you for the opportunity. You made the comment there though there for every youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">Visit they&#39;d be up to 11 podcasts. I think that&#39;s what you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.690" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:35.729" style="s2">the podcast market is absolutely exploding and you&#39;re actually sitting seeing this start to affect book publishing because</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.160" end="00:03:43.589" style="s2">audio books have become extraordinarily popular and people are discovering that they can use their found time when they&#39;re commuting or</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.740" end="00:03:50.339" style="s2">Exercising or walking or doing dishes whatever to engage themselves in high quality. Um</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.130" end="00:03:57.779" style="s2">well high quality educational material books and podcasts and so that&#39;s a real revolution it and it really is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:02.460" style="s2">So these are the people young people too, you know instead of listening to music</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.620" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">Which is really something because musics being a predominant cultural force for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:13.889" style="s2">So it&#39;s an it&#39;s an amazing technological revolution and I really appreciate it or a conversation by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.890" end="00:04:15.250" style="s2">I think we had a great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">I enjoyed it immensely</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:22.529" style="s2">And it seems to me that this is a sort of modern version and and I think this is terrific if I&#39;m understanding it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">Or the old idea where people who have perhaps had another great formal education had access to good quality</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:32.669" style="s2">Literature and so forth put together by whether it was penguin or what. Was it every man&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.669" end="00:04:35.639" style="s2">So every everyday books whatever they were called even Reader&#39;s Digest</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.310" end="00:04:40.890" style="s2">To make that education that learning the classics and so forth available widely</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.890" end="00:04:47.729" style="s2">And now this is a modern version of it perhaps and I think what&#39;s happening with the mainstream mean?</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">that they underestimate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">Moral quality of their viewers, they underestimate their intelligence. They underestimate their persistence and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">they&#39;ve also become quite manipulative in their use of editing and and message</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">Massaging spin really and the other thing that&#39;s really good about these sorts of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">Is that what you see is what you get their bare bones</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">They&#39;re they&#39;re not high-tech while they are and their highest tech in some sense, but not on the production end or the editing end</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.510" end="00:05:24.869" style="s2">So people can trust them and they&#39;re genuine conversations. They&#39;re not designed to craft the message or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.869" end="00:05:27.988" style="s2">They&#39;re not manipulative and and that&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.599" end="00:05:29.949" style="s2">YouTube YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.949" end="00:05:37.558" style="s2">Particularly doesn&#39;t respond well to manipulation as far as I can tell. Well, I enjoyed that conversation enormously. I&#39;ve been stunned by the response</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.709" end="00:05:40.889" style="s2">It&#39;s gone very very widely as you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:44.038" style="s2">Both on your site and on mine</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.619" end="00:05:46.678" style="s2">But to come back to that day</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.929" end="00:05:52.559" style="s2">later that day you gave one of the talks of the set one of the seven that you gave in Australia Chatswood and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.869" end="00:05:54.869" style="s2">I was very kindly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.240" end="00:05:57.359" style="s2">allowed to compare it for you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.059" end="00:06:02.609" style="s2">One thing that 19 years in public life taught me is to have a bit of a look at your audience and summarize them</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.919" end="00:06:07.618" style="s2">It was a pretty amazing experience. The first thing that happened was that you walked on before you said a word</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.619" end="00:06:12.268" style="s2">You&#39;ve got a standing ovation though that that&#39;s something unheard of in this country, but they did</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.329" end="00:06:15.389" style="s2">90 minutes talk they gave you another standing ovation</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.779" end="00:06:21.808" style="s2">you left came for a few minutes came back on took 30 minutes of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.329" end="00:06:27.449" style="s2">Again, they responded in the same way. Let me just say a couple of things about that audience. I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:31.769" style="s2">firstly I&#39;ve got to say pretty heavily impacted as I looked out there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.529" end="00:06:36.868" style="s2">Recognized that there was an enormous hunger to hear what you had to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.629" end="00:06:42.028" style="s2">Even though your message was perhaps best described as tough. Love you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.669" end="00:06:47.518" style="s2">Ginger in them up with a soft story. You were really pushing you were really challenging them</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.769" end="00:06:52.019" style="s2">The second thing that struck me is that I&#39;ve said many times since I reckon</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.419" end="00:06:57.838" style="s2">50% of the people in that room that night were young Australian men under the age of probably 35</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.139" end="00:07:03.329" style="s2">The third thing that struck me was that that was a was a cross section</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.329" end="00:07:08.609" style="s2">I would say many of them were University students, but all university graduates</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.610" end="00:07:13.649" style="s2">But many many were not and the fourth thing that just goes back to something. You said a moment ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.289" end="00:07:18.658" style="s2">They knew what you were saying and you&#39;re a clinical psychologist and a highly educated</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.029" end="00:07:25.018" style="s2">Person to suggest that they didn&#39;t understand would be very patronizing they got what you&#39;re on about. Oh, definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.269" end="00:07:26.709" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s no doubt about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.709" end="00:07:32.129" style="s2">I mean there those lectures aren&#39;t interesting unless you understand them and there&#39;s just no doubt that that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.129" end="00:07:34.469" style="s2">you know, I think one of the most that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.320" end="00:07:36.250" style="s2">psychologists have made</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.250" end="00:07:41.909" style="s2">Especially the more popular ones over the last three or four decades is to try to convince people that they&#39;re okay the way they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.010" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">It&#39;s like the self-esteem movement, you know, you should love yourself the way they you are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:50.340" style="s2">You should feel good about yourself the way you are and that&#39;s actually not a very optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.710" end="00:07:57.060" style="s2">Message for people because people are generally sensible enough to not be particularly satisfied with the way that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.640" end="00:07:59.470" style="s2">They want to be who they could be</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.470" end="00:08:03.510" style="s2">they want to have something noble to aim at and and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:07.740" style="s2">So I I make that case very strong that you&#39;re you should more</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.040" end="00:08:13.230" style="s2">but aligned and on board with who you can be then with who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.390" end="00:08:17.099" style="s2">that who you can be isn&#39;t a person who has endless rights or</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:21.300" style="s2">Or or as the member of a privileged or under privileged group</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.300" end="00:08:26.159" style="s2">It should be who you should be should be an individual who&#39;s willing to take on full</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.740" end="00:08:32.400" style="s2">responsibility for the for the catastrophe of existence and for the malevolence that&#39;s part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.010" end="00:08:35.249" style="s2">See, I think people are responding to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:40.679" style="s2">first of all because everyone who has any sense knows that life is a tragic business and that everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.410" end="00:08:48.749" style="s2">Susceptible to betrayal and malevolence on their own part and and as a consequence of the actions of others, that&#39;s our existential</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:57.030" style="s2">Predicament and I think people also know in a very deep sense that the antidote to that isn&#39;t security or safety</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:01.559" style="s2">And it&#39;s not envy or bitterness. It&#39;s the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:08.489" style="s2">try to work to make the world a better place to start with yourself to take responsibility for yourself and then to take</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.890" end="00:09:10.890" style="s2">responsibility for your family and then to take</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.350" end="00:09:17.249" style="s2">responsibility for your community and everyone knows that the people they admire are exactly the people that do that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">We also all know that that&#39;s what gets you out of bed on a rough morning</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">It&#39;s that you&#39;ve got something important and vital to do and it&#39;s not an easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">It isn&#39;t necessarily even something that makes you happy</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.020" end="00:09:36.749" style="s2">It&#39;s something that&#39;s meaningful and necessary to fight back against the tragedy and the malevolence of the world and people know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:42.479" style="s2">Deeply it&#39;s deeply rooted inside their their souls. I would say and a call to that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.330" end="00:09:48.239" style="s2">very meaningful for people including me, you know, I include myself and my audience like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:53.850" style="s2">Lecturing to them precisely. I&#39;m having a conversation with them about how we can step the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.850" end="00:09:54.519" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.519" end="00:10:00.929" style="s2">And we are setting it right things are getting better very rapidly around the world and we can really push that forward in the decades</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.930" end="00:10:06.719" style="s2">To come if we if we made a conscious effort and so I think this is a very exciting message for people</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:12.779" style="s2">One of the things that I&#39;d say about Australians is as I got the world&#39;s best bulldust detectors. They</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">recognise authentic authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.790" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">Very quickly, and if you&#39;re not authentic, they won&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">So I think in part they are responding if I can pay you a compliment by the fact that you weren&#39;t talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.639" end="00:10:26.639" style="s2">You were talking about us</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.730" end="00:10:29.730" style="s2">You were addressing</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.370" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">Where we are all together as human beings and in a way it was as though you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.509" end="00:10:39.509" style="s2">To get to the good news</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.759" end="00:10:43.379" style="s2">You&#39;ve actually got to go through what might be called the valley of death. You&#39;ve got to face yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.449" end="00:10:47.159" style="s2">You&#39;ve got to be realistic about yourself in the world that you live in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.130" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">And I saw those put young people</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:54.599" style="s2">It was almost as though they were saying we&#39;re sick to death of a therapy cup a culture that offers us sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.939" end="00:10:57.569" style="s2">To relieve to everyone there&#39;s a there&#39;s a dictum</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.850" end="00:11:03.149" style="s2">that Carl Jung derived from the great alchemists in the circle in this infinite or and it means</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:07.019" style="s2">What you most want will be found where you least want to look?</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.899" end="00:11:13.109" style="s2">What you most need will be found where you least want to look and that people know that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:15.329" style="s2">everyone knows they are tired of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.970" end="00:11:17.230" style="s2">naive</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.230" end="00:11:21.990" style="s2">Optimism let&#39;s say and not optimism because optimism doesn&#39;t have to be naive and they know perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.990" end="00:11:27.000" style="s2">well that the way to set themselves right is to take careful stock of themselves and to pay very</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.189" end="00:11:33.899" style="s2">careful attention to the errors that they know they&#39;re making and to and to grow up and to mature and to and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.389" end="00:11:41.459" style="s2">adopt the responsibilities of a forthright citizen and I think people are sick to death of too much discussion of rights and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.649" end="00:11:45.479" style="s2">too much discussion of self-esteem and all that all that all</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.910" end="00:11:50.069" style="s2">That discussion that goes along with what everyone owes you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.920" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">it&#39;s just not helpful to people because it isn&#39;t your rights that give you meaning in life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.790" end="00:12:05.399" style="s2">You need a meaning to set against the tragedy and every knows that the way that you find that meaning. It&#39;s by adopting responsibility, obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.190" end="00:12:09.690" style="s2">For yourself, you gotta take care of yourself your family</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.690" end="00:12:15.059" style="s2">I mean you want to be a good person to your parents. You want to be a good person to your siblings and your children</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">Clearly and you have to bear some responsibility for your community</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:24.060" style="s2">And if you&#39;re really firing on all cylinders, you do all those things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:30.419" style="s2">You know and and I do believe and I tell people I do believe that the world is the tragic and malevolent place in many</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:34.319" style="s2">many ways but that the way forward through that is is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:41.490" style="s2">Do everything you can to put yourself on the side of what&#39;s good and to aim high and that that&#39;s where you get the dignity</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.490" end="00:12:46.409" style="s2">That enables you to bear life without becoming corrupt and everyone knows this is true</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.930" end="00:12:48.930" style="s2">Who&#39;s gonna argue with that?</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.939" end="00:12:53.939" style="s2">having found yourself and having any of your like and being realistic about yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.459" end="00:12:59.609" style="s2">Recognizing we were talking about this last time the dividing line between good and evil. It&#39;s not between black and white or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.339" end="00:13:02.339" style="s2">captor and jailer</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.089" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">Or man and woman</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:12.360" style="s2">It&#39;s somewhere across every human heart having recognized that you can then go on and help build a stronger fairer more just more humane</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.519" end="00:13:14.470" style="s2">society rather than</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.470" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">what seems to be the way people approach it at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:23.639" style="s2">That somehow rather your society can fix your problems. Yes. Well, that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.639" end="00:13:28.619" style="s2">I mean for young people in particular, it&#39;s kits are actually a very depressing message for young people to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.620" end="00:13:35.310" style="s2">It&#39;s time for them to get involved in political activism because any young person who has any sense knows perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.310" end="00:13:41.369" style="s2">Well, if they&#39;re especially if they&#39;re 18, they&#39;re so 19 years old is they don&#39;t know a damn thing, you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.370" end="00:13:46.799" style="s2">They haven&#39;t started a business. They haven&#39;t started a family. They don&#39;t have a permanent relationship. They&#39;re not educated</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.870" style="s2">They don&#39;t have any experience and for someone to come and say well you&#39;re in a position to change the world is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.970" end="00:13:53.970" style="s2">nothing, but a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.040" end="00:13:57.750" style="s2">Disenchanting them with adult wisdom. It&#39;s like you&#39;re not ready to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.910" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">You&#39;ve got a lot to learn but you can learn it and in learning it you&#39;ll become much more powerful and much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.689" end="00:14:10.619" style="s2">Charismatic and much more articulate and much more wise and sensible and that&#39;s the way forward</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.870" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">to being much more than you are and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.050" end="00:14:21.240" style="s2">young people when you&#39;re 18 and you have 60 years of life ahead of you what you want to hear above all else is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.430" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">There&#39;s way more of you yet to come</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.790" end="00:14:27.570" style="s2">Because what else has anything with those 60 years</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.089" end="00:14:29.170" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.170" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s a message. It&#39;s a harsh message because it says well</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:39.539" style="s2">You&#39;re not everything you could be but it&#39;s a deeply optimistic message because it&#39;s because the idea is that you could be way more</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.700" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">Than you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:48.120" style="s2">incomparably more than you are and I do believe that and what&#39;s so fun about this is that people keep telling me that people</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:50.909" style="s2">Keep telling me that it&#39;s true. You know, I have people</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.640" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">Endless people I got one kid come up to me the other day. It was so fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.510" end="00:15:00.659" style="s2">He said a year and a half ago. I had just got out of jail and I was homeless</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.329" end="00:15:06.299" style="s2">And he said I started listening to your lectures and I just I got married this year</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.300" end="00:15:11.909" style="s2">I have a child and I just bought my apartment. It&#39;s like wow man. Good work</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.130" end="00:15:14.609" style="s2">You know you did that in a year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.160" end="00:15:21.570" style="s2">And you know, I was in LA the other about a month ago and you know this I was in a rough part of LA</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.360" end="00:15:26.550" style="s2">Downtown LA near the Apollo Theater, and I&#39;d given a talk there my wife and I were walking down the street</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:31.170" style="s2">This car pick pulled up and then his kid walked out. He was about 19 or so</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.209" end="00:15:37.499" style="s2">Good-looking Hispanic kid ran over and asked me if I was dr. Peters and I said yes, and he was all excited</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.500" end="00:15:42.239" style="s2">He said he&#39;d been watching my videos for about a year and a half and they really helped him straighten out his life</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:43.649" style="s2">He was just smiling away</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.649" end="00:15:44.670" style="s2">He said wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.670" end="00:15:49.349" style="s2">wait a minute and he ran back to his car and he came back out with his dad and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.750" end="00:15:51.459" style="s2">His dad was standing there</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.459" end="00:15:53.639" style="s2">you know and they had their arms around each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.709" end="00:15:56.518" style="s2">They were just grinning like mad and the kid said look</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.519" end="00:16:01.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve really put my relationship together with my father and we&#39;re really on board with this together</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.050" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">And they were just like so happy you couldn&#39;t believe it and that just happens over and over like it happens. I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.019" end="00:16:11.819" style="s2">four or five times a day in restaurants or in airports or while you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.949" end="00:16:16.139" style="s2">experiencing that to some degree in Australia you said and it&#39;s it&#39;s so good and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.360" end="00:16:20.339" style="s2">The mainstream media that&#39;s been covering what I&#39;ve been doing, you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.339" end="00:16:26.519" style="s2">they just missed this completely because everything it seems like everything that constitutes news in our society has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:34.689" style="s2">Political and group oriented this isn&#39;t political and it&#39;s not group oriented what I&#39;m trying to do as a good clinical</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:40.689" style="s2">Psychologist and perhaps a good educator and I mean good striving to be good in the moral sense is to help people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">develop as individuals and they are and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.870" end="00:16:50.679" style="s2">it&#39;s really working and it&#39;s it&#39;s a thrill to be on this tour because that&#39;s all I hear and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.990" end="00:16:58.839" style="s2">no one talks to me about the political issues or very very rarely and it&#39;s all because I also think that the battle against</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.780" end="00:17:04.749" style="s2">Collectivists and let&#39;s say the battle against identity politics isn&#39;t to be had in the political realm</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.690" end="00:17:09.789" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a secondary issue what the way that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.310" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">fight for the sovereignty of the individual is by getting your act together and and right locally right where you are and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.930" end="00:17:21.609" style="s2">starting to take advantage of everything that you have in front of you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:28.570" style="s2">And then you do, you know harm our way. All you do is make yourself less bad. Who what&#39;s the harm?</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.570" end="00:17:31.239" style="s2">Not that&#39;s a good thing to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.240" end="00:17:38.470" style="s2">I think the battle here is almost one of statism or collectivism versus individual liberty who&#39;s going to shape who?</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.930" end="00:17:44.739" style="s2">So you&#39;ve got the whole that sort of pushed from the left identity politics victimhood policies</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.470" end="00:17:48.819" style="s2">Approaches and what have you we owe these people? What have you?</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.340" end="00:17:55.029" style="s2">So the state has control and shapes individuals and helps them forward on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.190" end="00:18:00.970" style="s2">You have the different view that says no the state should be shaped by the people that make up the state, you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:05.739" style="s2">Australia is a sum total of individuals who are Australian and they ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.050" end="00:18:10.749" style="s2">Shaping the public square not having the public square of your local the public sector shaping them</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.540" end="00:18:18.190" style="s2">The whole argument is about what what what&#39;s the primary unit of analysis? That&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.190" end="00:18:25.179" style="s2">What&#39;s the primary unit of analysis and in the West the primary unit of the analysis has been the logos and that&#39;s something like Devine?</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.460" end="00:18:32.109" style="s2">individual consciousness and it&#39;s on that ground that we developed our idea of individual sovereignty and citizenship and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:36.249" style="s2">you know, we don&#39;t talk about a citizen is someone who adopts the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.830" end="00:18:42.069" style="s2">Responsibilities of an ethical being that&#39;s a citizen. We don&#39;t talk about that even in schools</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.310" end="00:18:46.179" style="s2">Tell people that look the meaning in your life is going to be found</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.910" end="00:18:50.590" style="s2">It&#39;s gonna be proportionate to the degree that you take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:58.689" style="s2">Positively shaping your experience and the experience of the people around you and this isn&#39;t like be good in some in some week</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:02.860" style="s2">Be inoffensive and harmless sense. It&#39;s not that at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.860" end="00:19:06.009" style="s2">It&#39;s like get your spine straight get your aggression</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.410" end="00:19:12.820" style="s2">integrated pick a heavy goal like a heavy high goal something you can barely tolerate lifting and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:20.230" style="s2">struggle along with it and that&#39;s where you&#39;ll find yourself respect and and people know that it&#39;s it&#39;s fun to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.630" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">Working-class guys respond to this too, you know because they know this most of those guys work like mad, you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.710" end="00:19:31.029" style="s2">and they know that there&#39;s nobility in that and and there is and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.970" end="00:19:33.490" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.490" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">I&#39;m people also say well that they&#39;re happy to come to my lectures or even read the book because</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.180" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">I&#39;m helping them find words to express things that they already knew to be true and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.440" end="00:19:44.620" style="s2">those things that they know to be true are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:50.889" style="s2">Bedrock axioms of our culture and one of the things we got right in the West was the idea of the sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.710" end="00:19:58.329" style="s2">Responsible individual not the person with rights and certainly not the person with rights granted to them by the state</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.060" end="00:20:03.249" style="s2">That&#39;s not part of the English common law tradition. You&#39;re the locus of Rights</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.250" end="00:20:07.750" style="s2">But but only in some sense because you&#39;re the locus of ultimate responsibility. I</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.810" end="00:20:15.009" style="s2">Guess part of what I&#39;ve been trying to tell people is that there&#39;s no difference between meaning and responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.650" end="00:20:21.759" style="s2">They&#39;re the same thing. Yeah. No, I understand what you&#39;re saying. Now as I looked at that audience. I thought to myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:25.059" style="s2">We&#39;re doing a lot of talking about the first world war in this country</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.250" end="00:20:32.680" style="s2">60 thousand Australians died out of a very small population in that horrendous event and we celebrate their bravery those young</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.780" end="00:20:34.780" style="s2">Anzacs we call them who went off to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:40.659" style="s2">Gallipoli and then to the Western Front and we&#39;re involved in some of the critical battles of the First World War</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.180" end="00:20:42.620" style="s2">every year</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.620" end="00:20:49.870" style="s2">Australians turn out in extraordinary numbers and more and more young Australians turn out to if you like pay tribute to their</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.030" end="00:20:55.210" style="s2">Courage and as I looked out across that audience, I thought there&#39;s a lot of people here that I&#39;d willingly</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.750" end="00:20:58.719" style="s2">Or I would choose to be with in the trenches</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.240" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">They are essentially people who want to be to use the word. You did just a moment ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">Noble to the best of their ability</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:10.930" style="s2">But they live in a culture somehow that says no that&#39;s all nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.000" end="00:21:13.479" style="s2">that&#39;s not where you ought to go and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:20.800" style="s2">It seemed to me that they&#39;re deeply resenting and deeply keen to reject that approach. Look here&#39;s here&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.950" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">so there&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.870" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">That&#39;s pushed very hard in the Universities by the postmodern neo-marxist types and before anybody objects</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:36.219" style="s2">I know perfectly. Well that technically speaking post-modernism and neo-marxist neo Marxism aren&#39;t commensurate</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.220" end="00:21:39.459" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t stop people from from joining them together</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.040" end="00:21:46.119" style="s2">Ideologically, but in any case the idea is that the West is fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.370" end="00:21:52.780" style="s2">which it isn&#39;t it&#39;s hardly an oppressive society because every society is partly oppressive and flawed, but</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:22:00.189" style="s2">fundamentally, the West is not an oppressive patriarchy and but if you by that line then the next thing that comes along is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:02.770" style="s2">Anything you do that?</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.810" end="00:22:04.160" style="s2">contributes to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.160" end="00:22:08.079" style="s2">Patriarchy is also oppressive and tyrannical and so that&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:12.819" style="s2">demoralizing for people who are trying to make their way in the world because they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.790" end="00:22:17.859" style="s2">Hoist their responsibilities up on their shoulders and become competent</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.590" end="00:22:22.660" style="s2">Contributing adults and they&#39;re criticized to death for being oppressive tyrants</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.660" end="00:22:30.550" style="s2">And so there&#39;s a conflation of competence with tyranny and you can&#39;t do anything to anyone that&#39;s more demoralizing that you know than that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.710" end="00:22:33.100" style="s2">Nietzsche said if you want to punish someone punish</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.740" end="00:22:37.479" style="s2">Them for their virtues and so they&#39;re tired of that. It&#39;s so demoralizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.270" end="00:22:44.469" style="s2">You know, like it appeals to the part of each man. Let&#39;s say and each woman for that matter who wants to avoid responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:49.630" style="s2">because you can rationalize it and say well I&#39;m not gonna take responsibility because that just makes me a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.090" end="00:22:52.209" style="s2">tyrant and an agent of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.340" end="00:22:58.209" style="s2">Patriarchy, but that&#39;s a-- that sort of thing leads people down at toolpath and I&#39;ve seen that my my friends and in my clinical practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.150" end="00:23:04.359" style="s2">So instead we say look like our culture has problems every culture does and it needs everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.490" end="00:23:10.150" style="s2">Everyone has to be awake so that we don&#39;t slip at every level of our social being into some like a blind</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.150" end="00:23:19.089" style="s2">authoritarianism, but the way that that happens is by waking up and taking responsibility once again for yourself and your family and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.090" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">Your community and that that and that&#39;s Noble which is a word you never hear</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.390" end="00:23:29.619" style="s2">It&#39;s like a human being has to be a noble creature to withstand the tragedy of existence without becoming corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.470" end="00:23:34.420" style="s2">and so and that calls to the best in people and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.020" end="00:23:40.089" style="s2">Jordan just we should wrap up on that part of it that evening though, but there was one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:44.830" style="s2">When we came to question time, there were four mics in the room. They lined up 20 deeper deets</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.830" end="00:23:50.769" style="s2">We got to seven. I think the seventh question was from a lady who asked a very intelligent question about what?</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:54.009" style="s2">Parents bring to their children and and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.770" end="00:24:00.339" style="s2">were there things that mothers brought to their children that women do best and other things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.950" end="00:24:08.289" style="s2">fathers bring to their children that are best you gave a very rousing answer the issue of fathering and as I say,</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:09.130" style="s2">There are a lot of men there</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.130" end="00:24:15.130" style="s2">I gather that your audiences of the demographics have broadened out now, but that was a very young man centric</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.680" end="00:24:17.000" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.000" end="00:24:21.339" style="s2">And you hammered the importance as I heard it all fathering</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.250" end="00:24:25.989" style="s2">Well, the the empirical literature on this is absolutely clear</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:31.750" style="s2">I mean, you know, we have this idea that&#39;s being pushed forward that all families are equal. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.450" end="00:24:36.789" style="s2">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a grain of truth in that in that people who are struggling</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.910" end="00:24:44.259" style="s2">Mightily to raise their children properly are worthy of respect whether there are single or in couples</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.260" end="00:24:49.540" style="s2">but the empirical literature is absolutely clear that that stable intact for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.970" end="00:24:57.100" style="s2">families with fathers there produce children who do way better on almost every possible measure and even more than that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.410" end="00:24:59.410" style="s2">in communities where</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.540" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">fathers tend to be at home</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:08.050" style="s2">What you know as part of the stable family the communities themselves do better even those kids that don&#39;t have fathers at home</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.600" end="00:25:14.650" style="s2">So the role of the father is unbelievably important and the question is what particular rold as a father plan</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.650" end="00:25:21.550" style="s2">I just had a good conversation with Warren Farrell about that and part of no part of my research should indicated that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.860" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">men are particularly useful in initiating</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.920" end="00:25:32.019" style="s2">Rough-and-tumble play and play with their children in general and Farrell extended that by noting that men could use the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.330" end="00:25:35.439" style="s2">to play as a reward for delaying gratification</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.020" end="00:25:37.250" style="s2">among their children</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.250" end="00:25:43.479" style="s2">That&#39;s a really big deal because one of the things you have to do to help people mature is to teach them to delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.790" end="00:25:46.450" style="s2">and to sustain attention and it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:52.029" style="s2">Men that the pleasure that children get in playing with their fathers</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:55.630" style="s2">Rough and tumble play but other forms of play as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.390" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">Of primary reward that can be used to help children learn to make the proper sacrifices and regulate their impulses over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.070" end="00:26:05.090" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.090" end="00:26:10.269" style="s2">So, you know and I think fathers now of course mothers can do this too, but I think fathers</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.240" end="00:26:17.199" style="s2">Are because mothers are generally charged with the fundamental care of infants. There&#39;s a tension between that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:21.009" style="s2">encouraging children to step forward out into the world as as</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:26.560" style="s2">Courageous beings and you know mothers are very very attached to their infants and their infants are very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.560" end="00:26:29.259" style="s2">it&#39;s often hard for them to make the transition from</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.900" end="00:26:31.070" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.070" end="00:26:33.189" style="s2">security provider and caregiver to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">forthright encourage</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.740" style="s2">er of adventure and that&#39;s certainly something that fathers can do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:46.479" style="s2">It&#39;s better to construe life as an adventure rather than as an enterprise that&#39;s there to make you feel secure or happy</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:52.269" style="s2">It&#39;s a great adventure and a dangerous one at that because everyone&#39;s life is at stake in this adventure</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.270" end="00:26:56.710" style="s2">You know, we&#39;re unbelievably tough creatures if we if we put ourselves out fully</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.850" end="00:27:05.199" style="s2">Okay, now you said something very interesting there and very important in my view you talked about empirical evidence in the relation to the importance</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:06.680" style="s2">of fathering</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.680" end="00:27:08.210" style="s2">empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.210" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:11.440" style="s2">evidence-based decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:13.010" style="s2">calm</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.010" end="00:27:17.800" style="s2">thoughtful deliberation rather than emotion in other words the difference between thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">Feeling seems to me to be incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.560" end="00:27:25.779" style="s2">We should follow the facts to where they take us, but we&#39;re confronted by it seems to be you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.780" end="00:27:30.820" style="s2">and you said they&#39;re not related but we tie them together there, you know sort of cultural Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.340" end="00:27:35.499" style="s2">post-modernism it seems to me the cultural Marxist will deliberately distort the truth be</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:41.410" style="s2">because of their agendas or hide the truth because of their agendas the post modernists are fallen into this trap of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.750" end="00:27:46.300" style="s2">If you like moral relativity, so what&#39;s good for you is true for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.300" end="00:27:51.519" style="s2">And what&#39;s good for me is true for me. Even if they&#39;re really painting black as white and white as black</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.070" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">Isn&#39;t that a problem?</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:57.250" style="s2">It&#39;s worse than that in some sense because it&#39;s not even what&#39;s true for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:00.550" style="s2">It&#39;s true for you. And what&#39;s true for me is true for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.550" end="00:28:04.359" style="s2">It&#39;s what it&#39;s true for your group is only good for your group</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.360" end="00:28:07.420" style="s2">And what&#39;s true for my group is only good for my group</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.420" end="00:28:14.259" style="s2">And so that sets us off in in group conflict in a tribal sort of way. You know the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.809" end="00:28:22.209" style="s2">the real radical types who are swallowed up by this ideology believe that science itself is nothing but a Eurocentric</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.550" end="00:28:26.169" style="s2">Patriarchal construct. I mean they dispense completely with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.020" end="00:28:29.259" style="s2">Scientific discovery has given us this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.990" end="00:28:36.099" style="s2">Technological power that&#39;s lifted the entire world out of abject poverty in a period of about a hundred and fifty years</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.440" end="00:28:39.429" style="s2">For that for them for some reason that doesn&#39;t constitute evidence</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:41.590" style="s2">and so when you bring up evidence</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.050" end="00:28:47.589" style="s2">There&#39;s hand waving because the people who dispute this sort of thing rarely know the details of the literature</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:53.530" style="s2">They just write it off and say well that whole scientific enterprise that&#39;s just part of the way that Eurocentric males</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.170" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">dominate and destroyed the planet</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.300" end="00:29:02.439" style="s2">It&#39;s all power games for these people. There&#39;s no there&#39;s no reality at the bottom of it outside of the power game</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:04.510" style="s2">And so that&#39;s a well</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.090" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">That that to me that that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a viewpoint that leads inevitably to tribal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.760" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">That&#39;s all that&#39;s all that&#39;s what it does know. You might be able to help me</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:21.819" style="s2">I think was George Orwell who made a reference to an idea being so utterly stupid that only a member of the intelligentsia could believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:25.059" style="s2">It no sensible person in the street would accept it for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.280" end="00:29:28.869" style="s2">There was a bit of there that night I would have thought you actually made a comment</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.390" end="00:29:36.579" style="s2">quite a I thought a very astute remark that about something that sound absolutely obvious and then you father finished it by saying you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.950" end="00:29:43.510" style="s2">Would have thought someone in a university somewhere might have noticed now if I&#39;d been an academic at any university in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.510" end="00:29:50.760" style="s2">I would have realized that I needed to wake up to myself because the audience lifted the roof the place with their applause they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:55.590" style="s2">highly skeptical about what is happening now in our educational institutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.750" end="00:30:01.439" style="s2">There is no other way to read that audience of a thousand decent Australians</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.660" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">They are very skeptical about the value for money. We&#39;re getting now out of our tertiary education sector</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:13.019" style="s2">Yeah, well, it&#39;s the whole education sector to I would say increasingly from kindergarten all the way through University</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.090" end="00:30:13.590" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.590" end="00:30:17.579" style="s2">I think that I&#39;m in very in creasing lis embarrassed to be a member of the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.070" end="00:30:24.509" style="s2">Because of that like I was reading this book today by a by a Norwegian called progress. It&#39;s a really good book</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.510" end="00:30:28.830" style="s2">I would highly recommend it very straightforward and all it is is a compendium of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.080" end="00:30:32.639" style="s2">empirical facts about how much better the world has been getting for the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">Hundred and fifty years in just every possible way three hundred thousand people a week are being hooked to the electrical power</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:43.049" style="s2">Grid, right we&#39;ve reduced we&#39;ve almost eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.140" end="00:30:50.700" style="s2">Starvation throughout the world except for political reasons and starvation was a big problem in places like Sweden and Italy</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.860" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">Less than a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.020" end="00:30:54.310" style="s2">Island</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.060" end="00:31:04.889" style="s2">We&#39;re just making progress progress on every possible front and everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.290" end="00:31:09.690" style="s2">that people learn in the education system seems to be associated with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:12.629" style="s2">human beings are a cancerous growth on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">planet that we&#39;re going to hell in a handbasket and that we&#39;re gonna burn ourselves out in the next 50 years and die and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:24.419" style="s2">It&#39;ll be our fault too. And you know, it&#39;s just not the case. It&#39;s simply not the case</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.420" end="00:31:30.990" style="s2">I mean we have problems in front of us, but there&#39;s a deep anti human ethos that permeates that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.990" end="00:31:34.319" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s still a hangover from our pessimism from the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.900" end="00:31:41.610" style="s2">You know because everyone was truly terrified for about five decades that we were gonna put everything to the torch, you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.610" end="00:31:46.379" style="s2">and maybe we still haven&#39;t really recovered from that and it&#39;s not surprising because it was brutal, but</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:51.269" style="s2">Reading this book on progress just made me think again. How badly were</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.340" end="00:31:54.870" style="s2">Educated because people just don&#39;t know how much things are getting better and why?</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.060" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">Free markets are a huge part of it private property is a huge part of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:04.049" style="s2">And that&#39;s all associated with the idea of the sovereign individual. And so this really works</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.050" end="00:32:10.919" style="s2">I mean, it&#39;s true that Europe got rich first, but that&#39;s only being a hundred and most at most one hundred and fifty years</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.920" end="00:32:17.729" style="s2">It&#39;s not even that long. It&#39;s really since about 1895 and Europe first, but man China there&#39;s no one starving in China</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.920" end="00:32:19.920" style="s2">There&#39;s no one starving in India</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.929" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">You know Southeast Asia</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">has enough food and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.800" end="00:32:25.780" style="s2">Sub-saharan Africa is growing like mad</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.780" end="00:32:31.290" style="s2">And then that we have these we have these we have our education system that trumpets that you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.290" end="00:32:37.409" style="s2">we live in a corrupt patriarchy that we should all identify with our tribal groups and that the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.780" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">Interviewing history is victimizer group against victim group. It&#39;s like it&#39;s no wonder people are skeptical about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.400" end="00:32:51.150" style="s2">It&#39;s a profoundly anti Western ethos. And the thing is about the West is we got the sovereign individual, right?</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.400" end="00:32:59.369" style="s2">It&#39;s right and it&#39;s the responsibility part. That&#39;s right. Not the rights part. I mean the rights traits are necessary. But but only</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.070" end="00:33:05.370" style="s2">The rights are there so that you couldn&#39;t express your responsibility. That&#39;s what that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.179" end="00:33:14.039" style="s2">Okay, well let&#39;s come to this issue of our own almost loathing now of our own beliefs and values</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:20.069" style="s2">here in Australia now, we&#39;re having an extraordinary debate going on a very wealthy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.250" end="00:33:25.559" style="s2">Likable, I knew him well philanthropists called Paul Ramsey who was very active in the health center</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:29.970" style="s2">Left a very large amount of money to be made available to set up</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.790" end="00:33:35.879" style="s2">An academy for the study of Western civilization and he wanted it to be done in one of our major</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.190" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">universities now one of our most acclaimed universities</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.790" end="00:33:47.309" style="s2">Entered into deep negotiations then the education union got involved and said no. No, this is going to be terrible. It&#39;ll be all about European</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.010" end="00:33:54.689" style="s2">Ideas of European supremacy so that same university has centers for Islamic studies for Indigenous Studies</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.660" end="00:34:01.319" style="s2">They are not particularly autonomous in the sense that the university or sorry. They&#39;re not particularly controlled</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.320" end="00:34:02.670" style="s2">It seems by the university</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.670" end="00:34:07.379" style="s2">They do pretty much their own thing, but I know you can&#39;t have a center for the study of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.659" end="00:34:10.499" style="s2">It will fill us up with all sorts of racist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.889" end="00:34:16.529" style="s2">Supremacist ideas. This is really worrying if we can&#39;t understand our own past</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.530" end="00:34:19.019" style="s2">In fact as a very wise Asian said here the other day</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:24.360" style="s2">If you wonder them that want to understand Asian cultures understand your your own first</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.740" end="00:34:30.660" style="s2">Well, it means to me it&#39;s just first of all, you know in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.660" end="00:34:34.739" style="s2">I&#39;m less worried about what&#39;s happening with the universities than I was because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.050" end="00:34:36.730" style="s2">They&#39;re going to destroy themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.730" end="00:34:42.840" style="s2">completely if they continue the way they are and that all that&#39;s going to happen is that people will take the genuine value in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.840" end="00:34:48.420" style="s2">Wisdom of the past and presented in alternative forms, they&#39;ll just steal it out from underneath the universities</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.420" end="00:34:53.909" style="s2">I would say to the philanthropist if the universities don&#39;t want the money then they should set up an institute on their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.850" end="00:34:56.910" style="s2">That might very well be a good course</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.610" end="00:35:04.799" style="s2">You can go directly to the people now, you know, like for now a social example for me if I want a lecture now</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:07.019" style="s2">I can lecture on anything I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.840" end="00:35:10.739" style="s2">Whenever I want with no bureaucratic restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.810" end="00:35:16.289" style="s2">And I have an audience of people who are only listening because they want to listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:19.260" style="s2">There that&#39;s where the university is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:24.150" style="s2">The University is where there&#39;s an audience to people who are only listening because they want to be educated</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.550" end="00:35:27.090" style="s2">That is the University. The buildings are irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:32.009" style="s2">Let&#39;s let&#39;s build on that from I&#39;m it because watching this debate unfold in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.080" end="00:35:36.330" style="s2">We&#39;re listening your academic saying ah, no. No, we&#39;ve got to preserve our academic integrity</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.450" end="00:35:39.450" style="s2">And we&#39;ve we&#39;re here to protect</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.030" end="00:35:43.140" style="s2">policies of diversity and inclusiveness</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.840" end="00:35:47.640" style="s2">And all of those sorts of things and somebody tartly pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.640" end="00:35:50.849" style="s2">Actually, we thought they were there to teach our young people how to think for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.580" end="00:35:55.890" style="s2">Primarily that isn&#39;t what they&#39;re there for because that&#39;s predicated on the idea that there are sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.230" end="00:36:00.150" style="s2">Individuals and that they can actually think for themselves as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.610" end="00:36:07.380" style="s2">The whole idea here is that you&#39;re not an individual. You&#39;re the member of a group that&#39;s it, and they&#39;re serious about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.380" end="00:36:13.049" style="s2">This isn&#39;t a trivial objection. It&#39;s a fundamental objection, but I would also say look there&#39;s a New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.600" end="00:36:19.169" style="s2">Statement don&#39;t cast pearls before swine and you know that usually has to do with words</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.810" end="00:36:25.110" style="s2">Right don&#39;t waste words of wisdom on those who will not hear but you could also just look at it</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.110" end="00:36:29.579" style="s2">literally if you have pearls and you&#39;re trying to give them to someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.800" end="00:36:36.070" style="s2">and they won&#39;t take them then go find someone else to give the pearls to if you&#39;re trying to give money to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.350" end="00:36:42.459" style="s2">University to do something great and they won&#39;t take it. It&#39;s obvious that they don&#39;t want to do anything great</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.650" end="00:36:45.160" style="s2">So don&#39;t give them the money. It&#39;s the wrong people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.940" end="00:36:48.940" style="s2">Ok, well, let&#39;s taste this had a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.670" end="00:36:52.629" style="s2">wisdom, you&#39;ve mentioned the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.330" end="00:36:55.870" style="s2">if you like knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.630" end="00:36:58.610" style="s2">accumulated cleverness</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.610" end="00:37:00.610" style="s2">and what have you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.770" end="00:37:01.790" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.790" end="00:37:05.499" style="s2">Surely there&#39;s a difference because to go back again to Chatswood</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.530" end="00:37:09.910" style="s2">I would say a good chunk of the people there were not university educated</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:14.259" style="s2">But they were smart and I would say they I&#39;d say more they were wise</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.290" end="00:37:21.820" style="s2">They were striving for wisdom. And that&#39;s where wisdom is wisdom is in the striving for wisdom and wisdom is building out</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.940" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">Wisdom isn&#39;t a collection of facts wisdom is knowledge of how to conduct yourself in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.310" end="00:37:35.679" style="s2">So it&#39;s a it&#39;s an action. It&#39;s an existential issue. It&#39;s an it&#39;s its truth as revealed in action. That&#39;s wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">wisdom also understands consequences</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.010" end="00:37:45.100" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s sophisticated in its understanding of consequences because you think well</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.110" end="00:37:48.219" style="s2">What are the consequences and the answer is well?</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.290" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">There&#39;s the consequences for you now and for you next week and next month and five years from now</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:59.289" style="s2">So the consequences are you and future you so that&#39;s an iterated game</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.510" end="00:38:05.469" style="s2">but the consequences are also for your family now and in the future transfer to your community now and in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.840" end="00:38:11.380" style="s2">wisdom is the ability to consider all of those consequences as part of your as</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.600" end="00:38:18.519" style="s2">part of what guides your vision and your and your and your operations in the world and that&#39;s character and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:22.360" style="s2">Then nobility of character is to take all of those things into account</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.030" end="00:38:25.030" style="s2">simultaneously as I watch the debate</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.030" end="00:38:30.009" style="s2">I thought to some extent one of the problems you&#39;ve got here is see as Lewis might have pointed out is pride</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.590" end="00:38:34.299" style="s2">Pride getting in the way of people having sufficient humility to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.090" end="00:38:41.499" style="s2">That the nonsense they peddling is simply unconvincing in terms of what you might call the pub test</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.660" end="00:38:43.490" style="s2">What would pass the pub test?</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.490" end="00:38:48.850" style="s2">Out there where people have common sense and can see when people are being real and when they&#39;re not being real</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.430" end="00:38:51.250" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s easy to dispense with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.250" end="00:38:56.770" style="s2">You just develop sufficient contempt for the common person and then you don&#39;t have to worry about what they think</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.860" end="00:39:04.150" style="s2">You know and then and that&#39;s and that&#39;s when you confuse being smart with being wise and they&#39;re not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.150" end="00:39:06.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.910" end="00:39:09.549" style="s2">In fact, I mean intelligence is a great gift</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.550" end="00:39:14.170" style="s2">But it can go terribly wrong and it can certainly turn into a kind of intellectual arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.170" end="00:39:20.829" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure that blinds you to to your own ignorance and humility is the antidote to that and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.650" end="00:39:28.329" style="s2">humility the element of humility there that&#39;s necessary is to understand that what you don&#39;t know is more important than what you know, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.270" end="00:39:34.300" style="s2">So if you&#39;re an ideologue you you dispense with all doubt because you already know everything I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.670" end="00:39:36.670" style="s2">gonna say I was reminded of that friend I</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.190" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">Chatswood as as you probably gathered it had the big impact on man. It was a powerful reminder to me that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.030" end="00:39:49.420" style="s2">For me, it seems very important to recognize it. There&#39;s a sense in which the more you learn the more you realizes</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.420" end="00:39:52.059" style="s2">You don&#39;t know very much and there&#39;s a lot more to learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.090" end="00:39:53.900" style="s2">Yeah, well</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.900" end="00:39:56.739" style="s2">You know being with an audience can help with it out, too</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:40:02.860" style="s2">Because if you&#39;re if you&#39;re talking to an audience, you can check to see if your message is being received, you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.860" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">And you might say well these people just can&#39;t understand what I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:07.210" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.210" end="00:40:10.210" style="s2">They probably can if you if you formulated it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.310" end="00:40:14.590" style="s2">And you actually talk to them individual to individual which is what I try to do in my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.590" end="00:40:19.299" style="s2">Like I&#39;m not talking to the mob. I&#39;m not talking to the group. I never talked to the group when I&#39;m lecturing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.300" end="00:40:26.350" style="s2">I always pick people in the audience and speak right to them and they reflect the audit, you know, they reflect the entire group</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.350" end="00:40:30.430" style="s2">But they only reflect it because the group is made up of individuals like them</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.989" style="s2">So let&#39;s just go back to something. You said earlier that ask of me is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.990" end="00:40:38.350" style="s2">And that is that young people don&#39;t want to be involved in political activism</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.350" end="00:40:41.799" style="s2">They want to get himself sorted out first many of those young people though</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.800" end="00:40:47.950" style="s2">I think want to behave nobly and help build a better society a stronger civic square if I can put it that way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:50.890" style="s2">Good on them. That&#39;s terrific. That&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.980" end="00:40:55.480" style="s2">They&#39;re very disillusioned with politics and yet we have to govern our country</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.480" end="00:40:57.980" style="s2">We have to make certain the rules are set if you like</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.470" end="00:41:03.559" style="s2">And that we maximize everybody&#39;s opportunities to live in freedom and insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.770" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">When young people have if you like grounded themselves and feel ready to act nobly in the public square</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.880" end="00:41:16.549" style="s2">What should they do? How can they make a difference they want to make a difference? How do they go about it Oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.370" end="00:41:19.700" style="s2">More power to them I think but I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.700" end="00:41:26.659" style="s2">They they start by realizing they don&#39;t know anything and by starting to learn and then if they learn and work and discipline themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.910" end="00:41:31.609" style="s2">The opportunities to expand will come naturally because people will notice them</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.980" end="00:41:37.369" style="s2">Like look if you work with competent people hyper competent people one of the things you learn is that hyper competent</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.370" end="00:41:40.130" style="s2">People are always looking for young people to mentor</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.340" end="00:41:41.100" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.100" end="00:41:42.780" style="s2">there&#39;s starving and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.780" end="00:41:48.830" style="s2">Hoping that someone will come along who who has a lot of potential and then what they&#39;ll do is offer them an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:55.609" style="s2">Hmm, you know, I keep my eye out at the University and in my private work as well all the time for young people</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.610" end="00:42:00.620" style="s2">Who&#39;ve got something to contribute. Oh, you look like you&#39;re sharp. Let&#39;s find out. Here&#39;s a task</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">Why don&#39;t you go try this then they come back and knock it out of the park. And you think oh, that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.600" end="00:42:07.789" style="s2">Cuz I got 20 more things here that need doing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.790" end="00:42:12.259" style="s2">I can&#39;t do I&#39;ve got more opportunities than I know what to do with here&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.260" end="00:42:19.880" style="s2">and so the thing is is that if you develop your competence and you discipline yourself and you start to make that manifest in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.100" end="00:42:25.819" style="s2">Hierarchy that&#39;s even vaguely competent. You&#39;ll have more opportunities come your way. Then you&#39;ll know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.550" end="00:42:28.550" style="s2">So it&#39;ll happen organically</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.220" end="00:42:32.209" style="s2">so and it it is the way of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:33.080" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.080" end="00:42:36.289" style="s2">if that isn&#39;t happening in the organization that you&#39;re working with and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:40.309" style="s2">Working diligently and you have your art together, then it&#39;s time to find a different organization</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.440" end="00:42:45.349" style="s2">But generally speaking most organizations aren&#39;t that corrupt? Some are</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.380" end="00:42:48.380" style="s2">interesting, I&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:50.899" style="s2">Australia&#39;s, have we worship youth culture in a way?</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.570" end="00:42:54.529" style="s2">but well things I&#39;ve noticed about youth is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.370" end="00:43:03.410" style="s2">Overwhelmingly if I have the opportunity to tap into the wisdom of an older person to be mentored they they go looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.410" end="00:43:05.340" style="s2">They&#39;re very keen for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.340" end="00:43:07.579" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s part of the part of the human</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.220" end="00:43:13.099" style="s2">Proclivity to admire and imitate, you know, I mean one of the things that drives us forward</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:13.780" style="s2">We don&#39;t only learn by facts. In fact, we hardly learn by facts at all. We learn by</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.780" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">Stories and we learn by imitation and we and may imitate those we admire and we admire those who are competent</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:26.700" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.700" end="00:43:30.290" style="s2">So if you find someone who knows what you don&#39;t and can operate effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.360" end="00:43:36.169" style="s2">in the world in a manner that you would like to but can&#39;t then you&#39;re going to admire them and if you admire them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.170" end="00:43:43.700" style="s2">Going to open the door to have them mentor you and I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s really fundamental to human cognition and human psychological</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.040" end="00:43:49.370" style="s2">Development it&#39;s the catalyst for human development because we&#39;re deeply imitative</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.370" end="00:43:52.609" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s the thing that distinguishes us from other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.610" end="00:43:55.789" style="s2">Perhaps even more than even more fundamentally than language use</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:43:59.840" style="s2">if I watch if you know how to do something and I watch you do it I</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.940" end="00:44:04.790" style="s2">Can learn to do it without having to go through all the pain that you had to go through to learn it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.830" end="00:44:06.830" style="s2">It&#39;s such a gift</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.990" end="00:44:09.560" style="s2">That&#39;s why history is so important our personal history</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.290" end="00:44:12.830" style="s2">Our if you like our family history</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.830" end="00:44:18.679" style="s2">I was thinking the other day that my grandfather made a mistake with my father on the farm that I am determined</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.750" end="00:44:22.969" style="s2">Because I can learn from that not to repeat with my own son on the farm</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.820" end="00:44:26.779" style="s2">And then there&#39;s of course the broader cultural history</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.850" end="00:44:32.329" style="s2">which is why I believe and I think you win it you and I share this view we ought to learn from our history we</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.330" end="00:44:34.330" style="s2">ought to learn from the horrors of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.530" end="00:44:37.489" style="s2">Collectivism in Soviet Russia, we ought to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.490" end="00:44:43.550" style="s2">We should teach our young people at the same time as we&#39;re honest about the what&#39;s in our own cultural history</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.550" end="00:44:45.709" style="s2">But we&#39;re also honest about the nobility</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.710" end="00:44:52.220" style="s2">For example the mighty push to abolish slavery surely the greatest human rights movement of all times. We ought to know about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.220" end="00:44:57.409" style="s2">It&#39;s Noble. It was led by noble people who struggled against extraordinary odds for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.900" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">Yes, exactly and slavery was a human Universal. So it&#39;s an it&#39;s an amazing miraculous attainment</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:11.330" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s a miraculous attainment. Absolutely and you know, what we&#39;re supposed to be doing in the Universities is separating the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.850" end="00:45:12.990" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.990" end="00:45:17.990" style="s2">dispensing with everything as if it&#39;s chaff because we don&#39;t want to put in the effort to discriminate and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.780" end="00:45:20.989" style="s2">So it&#39;s easier. Well, it&#39;s just all corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.990" end="00:45:21.620" style="s2">It&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.620" end="00:45:24.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not people aren&#39;t starving to death any more and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.810" end="00:45:30.229" style="s2">societies are increasingly free and children are dying in the massive numbers that they once died in and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.660" end="00:45:32.899" style="s2">People are people&#39;s life expectancy has doubled</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.690" end="00:45:35.270" style="s2">Like things are going pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.270" end="00:45:36.869" style="s2">don&#39;t muck it up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.869" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">We need to figure out why and we need to take stock of the things that we did in the past that were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.630" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">Obviously, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everything everyone did in the past was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.060" end="00:45:55.549" style="s2">That&#39;s that that&#39;s not thinking that&#39;s just that&#39;s just reflexive resentment masquerading as intellectual superiority</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.940" end="00:45:58.940" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing about it. That&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.340" end="00:46:03.049" style="s2">When you&#39;ve been incredibly generous with your time, can we wrap up? Let&#39;s just think through</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.690" end="00:46:07.669" style="s2">What would we say in terms of people looking for solutions in?</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.580" end="00:46:14.360" style="s2">Academia in the media in politics. How do we if you like</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.910" end="00:46:17.060" style="s2">Start the movement to reclaim</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.610" end="00:46:19.170" style="s2">What you called?</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.170" end="00:46:26.990" style="s2">evidence based empirical decision evidence in decision-making in other words learn to think again and stop being us so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.150" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">so emotional there&#39;s a place for emotion, but there&#39;s a place for thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.760" end="00:46:34.670" style="s2">Think well, I mean if you&#39;re a university student</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.670" end="00:46:39.409" style="s2">the first thing you want to note is that you&#39;re there to learn to think and to write and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.930" end="00:46:45.950" style="s2">Read and to speak that&#39;s what you&#39;re there to do. And the reason you&#39;re there to do that is because that makes you incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.500" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">confident</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:51.859" style="s2">Because you&#39;re going to have to communicate with people for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.859" end="00:46:54.199" style="s2">And if your communication has depth and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.300" end="00:46:58.999" style="s2">Then you can see your way forward and you can bring other people aboard and you can do great things</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:01.519" style="s2">And so it&#39;s super it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.850" end="00:47:05.809" style="s2">useful to get a real liberal arts education</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.450" end="00:47:10.189" style="s2">because it can make you into a great communicator and thinker if</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.410" end="00:47:14.510" style="s2">You&#39;re going to university read the great books and you can you can find</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:17.060" style="s2">Professors who will teach you that but that&#39;s what you&#39;re there to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.060" end="00:47:18.660" style="s2">You&#39;re there to spend four years</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.660" end="00:47:24.920" style="s2">immersing yourself in the imitation of the greatest people that our culture has produced and if you think well</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.920" end="00:47:29.420" style="s2">There were no great people. Well, then you might as well not go to university because</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.180" end="00:47:36.169" style="s2">University is the storehouse of the thoughts of great people and if you dispense with a whole notion notion of great then</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.450" end="00:47:43.399" style="s2">Maybe you&#39;re there too. I&#39;m a political activist, but that&#39;s not university. That&#39;s something else that&#39;s like an ideological cult and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.950" end="00:47:46.850" style="s2">Maybe that&#39;s what you want. And and and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.640" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">You know, you&#39;ll pay the price for that one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.210" end="00:47:57.919" style="s2">But you even there&#39;s a university student you have to take on the burden of educating yourself to large degree</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">But you have to decide that that&#39;s what you want. And that&#39;s what you need in terms of your own personal life</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:08.750" style="s2">Um, I have a program that I developed with my colleagues called the Future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.600" end="00:48:14.659" style="s2">It&#39;s itself authoring calm and it helps people develop a vision for their life</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.870" end="00:48:19.880" style="s2">along about six fundamental dimensions family education</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.700" end="00:48:22.850" style="s2">mental and physical health career</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:26.570" style="s2">avoidance of temptation like drug and alcohol use</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.660" end="00:48:32.780" style="s2">We tried to parse out our use of time you productive and meaningful use of time outside of work</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.150" end="00:48:36.110" style="s2">we tried to parameterize a decent life and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.270" end="00:48:41.090" style="s2">Then to guide people through the process of imagining what their life could be like if they put it together</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.370" end="00:48:46.849" style="s2">properly and you need to develop a vision for your life and a sense of who you could be if you were the character that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.850" end="00:48:48.840" style="s2">you could be and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.840" end="00:48:54.049" style="s2">Thinking through that and articulating it is they&#39;re actually part of it should be part of a classic liberal arts education</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.420" end="00:48:58.610" style="s2">Because the whole point of Education apart from the technical end</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.610" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">Which is important is to produce a noble citizen. That&#39;s the point not to produce a bloody political activist</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:09.530" style="s2">Well, then you just wish would keep in mind that cuz</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.380" end="00:49:12.380" style="s2">even a Chatswood that not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.690" end="00:49:15.560" style="s2">Lot of those people. Most of them are not at university</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.780" end="00:49:21.439" style="s2">So they&#39;re not excluded either from in any way shape or form from broadening their horizon</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.629" style="s2">It&#39;s not like they&#39;re not doing important things like working men for example working people in general</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.630" end="00:49:31.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t care what they&#39;re doing if they&#39;re working at a diner as a waiter. They&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.010" end="00:49:36.439" style="s2">They&#39;re laying bricks or what working a forklift or they&#39;re plumbers or these people are bloody important</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.440" end="00:49:40.280" style="s2">they build the infrastructure and there&#39;s a huge difference between a a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.860" end="00:49:44.089" style="s2">craftsman who takes pride and caring what he&#39;s doing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.700" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">Contributes to his family and the community in that nobility of work and someone who does shot in half hazard job</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.670" end="00:49:53.909" style="s2">There&#39;s great nobility in genuine work</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.609" end="00:50:02.069" style="s2">So and and I believe that you have just as much power. Let&#39;s say much as much authority as much clout as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.250" end="00:50:08.489" style="s2">forthright and honest working person as you do as an intellectual and I mean you can be very</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.650" end="00:50:11.220" style="s2">successful as a working person if you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.710" end="00:50:15.270" style="s2">Diligent and honest and committed and competent and aiming up</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.580" end="00:50:19.469" style="s2">because it look I do believe that each person is the center of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.660" end="00:50:23.190" style="s2">You have what you need right at that Center and maybe you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:28.530" style="s2">Intellectual, but you&#39;re good with your hands and you&#39;re practical and solid and people can rely on you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.530" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">It&#39;s like man</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:33.690" style="s2">That&#39;s a big deal because then when their roof blows off in the middle of a storm</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.090" end="00:50:39.959" style="s2">They can call you up and you&#39;re there in an hour and you put the damn thing back together and and and hooray for you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.300" end="00:50:47.369" style="s2">It&#39;s a all of these things are important. And so there&#39;s great nobility in working class work as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.910" end="00:50:53.369" style="s2">Well Jordan that&#39;s again a fascinating conversation from my perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.100" end="00:51:00.479" style="s2">It&#39;s tremendous to be able to interact with somebody who cares passionately because that&#39;s what that&#39;s what they&#39;re picking up</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:01.690" style="s2">I know it&#39;s not about you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.690" end="00:51:05.429" style="s2">You&#39;re actually trying to make a difference for people and you know, we&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:11.190" style="s2">I&#39;m really disturbed by the way in which some of these movements were seeing at the moment of trying to divide men from women and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.710" end="00:51:16.679" style="s2">A lot of people getting men are getting this idea that somehow their masculinity is toxic</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">Well, you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:26.310" style="s2">We don&#39;t say that when the brave young French policeman takes a bullet for a young woman and her daughter in a French supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.320" end="00:51:30.719" style="s2">We celebrate that and I actually think that not all</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.030" end="00:51:36.479" style="s2">But the great majority of men want to be Noble they know their flaws</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:40.740" style="s2">As you said they&#39;ve got to be honest about them. We all need to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.350" end="00:51:45.509" style="s2">But they also have a big part of them if you like that divine spike</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.510" end="00:51:50.489" style="s2">So does aspire divine spark that leads them to want to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.489" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">responsible noble people</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.350" end="00:51:53.850" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.850" end="00:51:56.009" style="s2">And that&#39;s that&#39;s what women want for men too</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.320" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">so unless and as they&#39;ve been damaged in their</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:04.980" style="s2">Relationship so that they don&#39;t trust men at all and then are prepared to dispense with all of them which isn&#39;t helpful</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.560" end="00:52:11.580" style="s2">But, you know men and women need to call to the nobility in each other and that is what they both want because you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.580" end="00:52:13.830" style="s2">a stalwart companion by your side</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.170" end="00:52:19.529" style="s2">know if you&#39;re a man you want someone you can trust and you can rely on it who will help guide you and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.690" end="00:52:25.409" style="s2">and and care for you and to care for your children and all of that and to make a life with and if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.410" end="00:52:28.469" style="s2">Woman you want a man that you can rely on and that&#39;s going to help you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.690" end="00:52:34.889" style="s2">Help you deal with the children and with the excess fragility that you have because of your pronounced role in reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.080" end="00:52:40.840" style="s2">and that is what we want and to denigrate and to split men and women apart is is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.580" end="00:52:49.360" style="s2">Damage humanity itself because it&#39;s not like we&#39;re all men are all women. I have sisters and a mother and a wife</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.360" end="00:52:49.810" style="s2">and a daughter and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.810" end="00:52:54.120" style="s2">Women have husbands and sons and fathers. We&#39;re not separate and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:58.829" style="s2">to split us apart on on the basis of sex it&#39;s, it&#39;s well. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.350" end="00:53:06.029" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s as pathological as a suicidal impulse or a murderous impulse or a genocidal impulse</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.070" end="00:53:07.530" style="s2">none of that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.530" end="00:53:08.640" style="s2">It&#39;s not acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:13.379" style="s2">But we&#39;re a hell of a lot better off than we were and things are getting better and we can do better yet</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.570" end="00:53:15.570" style="s2">That&#39;s a way better story</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.510" end="00:53:19.140" style="s2">We look forward very much to having you back on those shores</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.669" style="s2">Very nice speaking with you again, and thank you very much for the opportunity. Thanks Jordan</p>
