<p begin="00:00:01.199" end="00:00:05.200" style="s2">welcome to our weekly at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.520" end="00:00:06.799" style="s2">board meeting where right now we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.200" end="00:00:09.040" style="s2">going through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.799" end="00:00:10.480" style="s2">foundational documents as outlined by</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.040" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">protocol.love</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.480" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">and working on them for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:17.359" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">we did the vision a couple weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.359" end="00:00:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do the mission last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">but one of us wasn&#39;t available and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.840" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">two of us weren&#39;t available so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:25.039" style="s2">postponed it till this week</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">so we are going to be looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.039" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:29.439" style="s2">uh as i stated right before you got uk</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:31.519" style="s2">henley i&#39;m a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">well not a bit my brain fog is rather</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">large at the moment this week so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">i tried to order them in my head and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">was or read them through and order them</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:41.920" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t really working</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">but they all seem important which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.920" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">partly why</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to order and like whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">they&#39;re important for</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">game b or together tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:55.039" style="s2">or time wise right now right like how</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">many of these are things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.039" end="00:00:58.719" style="s2">actually implement right now and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">many and i don&#39;t know whether that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">is part of it but like that for me is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">was part of processing what was most</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">important and least important was like</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">wait is it for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">is it for game b is it for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">is it for</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">you know like there&#39;s things that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">think are a high priority but aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">together tech&#39;s current priorities so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">anyway that was just a bit of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">going through maybe that might be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">place to start i had kind of the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:23.439" style="s2">vibe as i kept going through it and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">kept sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.439" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">getting stuck in the same areas and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.360" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">think just a bit about how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">last time went we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">i think crossing wires a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">and not explicitly saying like okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:37.759" style="s2">here&#39;s where i think we should end up</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">versus here&#39;s what i think our next</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.759" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">steps are because i think our next steps</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">are almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">never going to be ideal in like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">long-term scheme of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">but if the goal is like to get it off</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s where like you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">your goals where those will never change</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got the actual like</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">steps or tactics that you you plan to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">to take to get you there and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">short term</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">ideas and solutions to get us to where</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">we want to end up and so i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.039" style="s2">as we&#39;re talking through it to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">out which part we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.039" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">like oh i think long term we we&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">to do x or we we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">we want it to serve x roll and then it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">might be okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">to get it off the ground we need to do a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">certain thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">also i just wanted to reread the um the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">vision statement we did decide on</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:33.760" style="s2">because that will be very tied to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">right is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.760" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">is our mission going towards that which</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">i think will be the priority</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">anyway for me anyway helpful priority</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">prioritizing the missions</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">a vision a world where abundant</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">resources are available</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">to pro omni win projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">yeah so the the mission supports that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">so maybe we should just talk through a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.879" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">few because i think when you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">like the vision it should be not it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">should be not tied to time</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">so i think if we&#39;re having trouble where</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">things are like oh when are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">this then i think that those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">those are strategy um</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to pull up the document</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">to see but my computer is really slow</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if someone else wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">pull it up and share</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">that i can even do even with my broken</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">because i can copy</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">if i copy that&#39;s the problem not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.390" style="s2">base and i copies urls pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">pretty easily um</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.390" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s doing it from here to there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">the problem i&#39;m not from</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">from there to here</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">i think also also in the um in here i</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">think i had do have permission to change</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">it so i can just change it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">something that says vip</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">in order values improvement revenue</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">oh i think that&#39;s why that makes so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">more sense because i think we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">talking about changing it from profit to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">revenue i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">that&#39;s not what that stands for that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">be rbir that&#39;s enormous that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">i remember the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">mvp and be happy</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">so do i need to share it then</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">i already shared it in the private chat</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">yeah oh no i meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">shared on the screen so our audience can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">see what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">reading but we don&#39;t have to that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">be a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">that part</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">url i did was very very long i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">know if i want to be able to type that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">out and do that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">no no i can i can do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">let me</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">so yeah like you said that&#39;s our vision</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">so these were the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">sus suggested um</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">the brainstorming of the mission</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">statements not really suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">actually i&#39;m trying i don&#39;t have a great</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">definition of mission statement off top</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">of my head</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">so like local communities that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s a vision not a mission</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">i mean the mission could be build local</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">um i think mission or action statements</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.379" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.160" end="00:05:58.379" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">the first one seems to be rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">i mean yeah so i i really kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">unless that&#39;s missing something or</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">is too expansive or so what do y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s just read through the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">ones and see if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">missing from there because i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">you&#39;re right i think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">the full picture of it profit being</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">important but not number one</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:33.919" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering because i know the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">part down where we look at the currency</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.919" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">and how do we know if we&#39;re meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">um not to get ahead of ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">whether because i think the part about</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">the vip even though it&#39;s now wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">is like that it&#39;s in order that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">like the values</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">improvement profit so like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">is this i actually don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">improvement is like are we approved</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">improving the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">improvements like um</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">progress over perfection so like even</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">you know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">like if there&#39;s a bit a give and take as</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">long as it&#39;s towards going you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">a a net overall win for the values then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">that that that&#39;s fine but sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">values are always number one</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">trying to improve those values you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">which is sort of like okay that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">in context of the values</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">and then as long as n neither of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">is ever</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">um broken or violated</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">then you know the goal is to to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">profit</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">but just never at the expense of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">values or</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">or progress yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">profit or money that is generated is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">yeah after gone back and think about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">and i still think the profit is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">correct word because you also want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">keep your expenses low just like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">company would</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">where the the difference being that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">profit that you then spend so it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">an expense</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s sort of like the i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">two level there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">absolute expenses like your staff costs</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">and hosting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">just you know all that stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">the money that&#39;s left over you can spend</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">on other stuff on other projects on</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">i think that for me reading the mission</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">sorry the vision statement a world where</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">abundant resources are available to pro</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">omni win projects i really like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">first part of the mission because it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">like abundant resources and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">listed out the resources right</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">the knowledge the digital tools the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">mentoring um</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">and i think the rest can probably be not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">there then just that first part</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">my only issue with the four is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">mentoring is a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">thing like what we do for round tables</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">isn&#39;t really mentoring it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">peer-to-peer right it&#39;s not someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">who&#39;s an expert</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">and so mentoring slash not that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">want mentoring that would be great but</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:49.519" style="s2">we just don&#39;t have that in place but</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">there&#39;s also the like peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.519" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">crowdsource</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">part of it that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">many minds that are not yet experts are</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">better than</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">one mind that&#39;s not an expert right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">also wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">different mentoring is from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">knowledge commons i guess the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">commons is like a database and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">mentoring is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">as you said a one on one and so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s it that it&#39;s not mentoring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s like the relational</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">part of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">either as someone who&#39;s an expert or as</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">um on par or even your mentoring someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">else right you might be men in the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">conversation i might be mentoring you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">and then you might be mentoring me</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">and just that part makes us peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">right so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">that the abundant resources are like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">people information and infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">yes oh and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">resources money</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">yeah yeah i&#39;m just wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">those are specific enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">or um</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">it yeah because i mean people people</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">could mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">people to do the work and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">different from mentoring or</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">um and so yeah and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">like relationships that implies</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know better i&#39;d say a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">relationship not</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">not an exchange of value</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">you know you can have relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s orthogonal to you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">helping each other out</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">um so you think that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">is networking a better word it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">of game a but it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of more in that direction i</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">think i mean well i mean networking</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">is generally the first step to the to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">the mentoring or the giving feedback but</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not that actual step</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">networking is finding people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">uh but then i mean to your point</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">like one of the resources is knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">so that knowledge could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">either documented</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:14.960" style="s2">or it could be people</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.960" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">regardless of how the knowledge provided</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">and like in the early case we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">providing all that knowledge through</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">people because we don&#39;t have a database</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s what kind of appear to peer in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">for me so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">but the yeah so but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">so i mean to me knowledge is a resource</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know so maybe if we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">get a little bit more specific maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">funding</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">funding knowledge and uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">see infrastructure kind of implies for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">lot of people implies</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">hardware and not software</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">don&#39;t um like assets or something super</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">vague</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">yeah i mean you could say</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">you know tools although tools still that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">implies something you do something with</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">and not the actual thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s no perfect word and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">just need to um</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">i mean i mean i like knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.260" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">uh and then we could clarify the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">knowledge to say that it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">commons and um pure</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">here that is what i meant by the relate</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">i maybe use the wrong word but</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">is there&#39;s information right which can</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">be cataloged can be databased could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">like if you&#39;re giving the same advice to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">everyone you want in one location</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s also no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">rich in information that is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">still something else we offer that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">right that is like that there are people</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">here who also have projects and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">care like even if</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:17.519" style="s2">like that is part of what we offer</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">whether it&#39;s mentoring or peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">is like a community</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">the people even if you&#39;re not at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">relationship stage yet right like as</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">soon as you show up you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">relationship stage it&#39;s just like how</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">along how deep and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">yeah yeah i guess what i was thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">that the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">and just going through something</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">difficult with other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">is a separate value than the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">mentoring i mean they tend to happen at</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">or that knowledge um</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">abundant resources so yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">pottery</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">uh-huh community is just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">little i said camaraderie</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">oh yeah maybe we should just list</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">everything out</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">uh in in the many different ways to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">it and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">we can pick and pull so like</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">and we could just list them all actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">relationships i still like mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">because having someone come alongside</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">you that&#39;s been through it before</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">um you could still mentor each other um</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">uh camaraderie is what i said otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">if we&#39;re just brainstorming camaraderie</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">and peer-to-peer or i</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">wish there was a better name for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">just well there is perigogy</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">which is the technical term for learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">from each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">um what are some other learning new</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">words from my peers</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s spelled properly</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not um</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">what are some other uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">kind of like knowledge commons</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">hi maybe we should do you want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">it separate to different lines</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">like one is the people one is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">information and then one is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">and information overlap</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">yeah i mean i think we can break them</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">down once we kind of throw them out</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">such digital tools i really should put</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">these all in separate</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">and i guess they&#39;re just not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">uh what else and then actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">resources right like money but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.560" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">if you have something i can borrow that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">is going to be um</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">okay like i use adrial stream yard right</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">like that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">than borrowing it it&#39;s not costing him</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">anything but it is still helpful like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">sharing in resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">that are um not necessarily money right</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">like money and the equivalents</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">money and things that save you money</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">funding and shared resources i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">adequate</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">yeah so kind of a software is a shared</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">um infrastructure would be a shared</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">and maybe digital tools is just another</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">way to say software but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">i i kind of think that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">there&#39;s like somewhat of a difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">between um like</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">stream yard which is an outside one that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">like if i had to have my own i&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">you know even pay separately versus if</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">we created it we&#39;re setting all of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">so like there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">between internal and external and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">the software fees and the digital fees</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">so that we can all share in them is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">different than like what do we need and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">then co-creating it together</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">or bringing it to the commons but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it needs to be included i</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">think just the end goal is to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">a useful pool of shared resources and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">there isn&#39;t something effective enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">then we may end up</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">building our own prism for some of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">but i think it still all goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">the shared resources shared tools</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">thing whether we build it or we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">know buying it or losing it from</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">yeah and so a world where abundant</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">resources are available to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">prolong you in so i i kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">that if you were gonna like we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">literally just list all these things out</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">our mission is to provide blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">and just list them all out um</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">i i think i think you could categorize a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">lot of these under community</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">um and just clarify later like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">mentorship the camaraderie</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">paragogi and relationships</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">sorry um</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:50.479" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.210" end="00:18:50.479" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">i&#39;d still like to keep funding and money</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">separate from shared resources</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">even though technically that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">resource just because it&#39;s very specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">and then i don&#39;t know where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">knowledge commons falls in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">now interesting thing when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">about community</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s two very different</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">sides to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">that or i mean we might be helping to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">blur those lines but um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">or one are like the actual community of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">people working on projects of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">like actual possibly developers and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">marketers and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">and mentors there&#39;s that whole side of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">things and then there&#39;s the community</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">users the people who are actually your</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">um and i think it&#39;s mainly the first one</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">and then we&#39;re hoping for like a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">across a you know a project</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.320" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">cross-pollination</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">as things are happening but i&#39;m i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">sure if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">well yeah i mean so this yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">community is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">the group of people working on it um</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">and i think the other one you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">saying could be called uh a user base</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">can user base go under shared resources</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">because that&#39;s a little bit like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">not really i don&#39;t get to just like pass</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">off my users</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">but like it kind like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">an audience yeah that&#39;s an audience</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">although audience yeah audience</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">implies like it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s not shared in quite the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">way right we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">for me to share my stream yard i just</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">have to give her the the information</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">stream yard doesn&#39;t then have to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">its own choice but whereas for an</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">all you&#39;re really doing is saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">check out these projects follow them if</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">you want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">but it i don&#39;t know it&#39;s the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">that event like we do have a pool of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">users that are like together</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">text copy members right and so because</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">there&#39;s that pool</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">if if wikilection brings them in they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">you know i mean we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">that beholden to together attack but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be more likely through</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">being in wikilection to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">somewhat loyal to whatever comes out</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">through that right and same with all</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">whoever we bring on board is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">being brought on board for all of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">if done in that way right and that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">part of the the power of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">sharing in those resources voluntary you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">sharing of a pool of people that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">would be interested in multiple multiple</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">leaving anything out</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">i think that&#39;s good it&#39;s just changing</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">them into mission like um</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">actiony things right like creating</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">kind of like that just being the heading</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">the following resources</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">benefits for omni when</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">projects and ideas works</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">so i kind of like that as the heading</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">sentence for it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">uh someone had posted posted on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">is one of the um</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">that the mission suggestion is increase</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">the adjacent possible question mark</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i like that for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">mission and i think we already have our</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">but i do there&#39;s something there like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">that is kind of the point right not</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">to create the adjacent possible always</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">does mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re also increasing the then</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">possibility of the next adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">possible the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">impossible right like that&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">um oh where i think it was before</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">i think that&#39;s it i think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">phrase and a great thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think that that falls into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">category of a mission</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">agreed um</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;s our mission&#39;s tangible like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">like you know when you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">do we know if we have a community so</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">yeah i mean that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">that might be more strategy and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">so i was just looking up the definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">on investopedia it says</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">a mission statement is used by a company</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">explained and simple and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">concise turns its purpose for being but</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s our visions</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">well it is our purpose for being the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">vision statement is what it&#39;ll look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">what that purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">is fulfilled um</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">i should have thought about this let me</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">mission versus vision</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">i mean i think we&#39;re still going to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">to wordsmith and you know do some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">with these after we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">we got the the basic foundations i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">really we&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">define resources so that well we we</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">we may end up having a separate mission</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">for sort of each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">that all roll up to the overall vision</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">of increasing the resources available</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">for omni and projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">um which i think then you know will also</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">at some point have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">squirrel conversation with around omni</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">win but for now we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">um well i i mean that&#39;s really i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">all we are if if this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">true once we get those two figured out</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s most of it just the the resources</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">help with and what projects we&#39;re hoping</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">to help with like that sort of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">two sides and then it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">ironing it out so i think that this part</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">is still</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">quite important</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">yeah i yeah i mean i think this is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just wording from here on out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">what level you want to go to in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">um yeah i i agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">i think those are exactly what we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">and so i keep trying to scroll on your</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna gr i&#39;m gonna gray these out</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">for now</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">so yeah so we could just</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">ford smith that or we could sit with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">for a while and wardsmith</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">i think partly i i looked ahead i</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">spoiler alert because</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">now we&#39;re going to be talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">we know if these are accomplished right</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">how do we know if the mission is being</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">accomplished and i think in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">we will be word smithing right like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">mentorship well how do we know if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">achieve it in figuring out our metrics</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">for achievement we will figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">to say it in the mission</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">if that makes sense right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be kind of a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">or as we try to continue on we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">to have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">and wordsmith the mission and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">even the the vision a couple more times</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">make it all a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">thing yeah so i guess we could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">mission accomplished on designing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">mission because even though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">perfect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s that and i think the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">part is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">um is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">what was omni-win is it for saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">you know to provide resources to omni 1</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">i guess one of the important elements is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">when we say everyone wins who&#39;s everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">likes something that might not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">obvious is you know the environment or</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know where to put this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">possibly also</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">what does wind mean like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">and again i don&#39;t think that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">get like super specific on</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">keyword smithing but just as we start to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">have these lists of like okay what are</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">the resources that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">provide and who are we helping and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">mean by help and i guess that&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">as resources</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">um but just and this is i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to end up with these two or</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">three lists that we&#39;re going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">having to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">and massage and try to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">make them all work</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">together so</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">i have this um i started like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">very rough list where i mean it was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">like there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s people which is a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">list where some of those are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">like actual staff and people working at</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.470" style="s2">the company people who started etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">there&#39;s your customers um</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.470" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a whole other spousal</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">group from your your suppliers to your</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">competitors</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we&#39;re too worried about</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">our competitors also winning in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">um but you wouldn&#39;t want to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">like overtly hostile</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">um customers suppliers competitors</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">and then also staff</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">um and then on the not people side</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">there&#39;s the environment which is a broad</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">term so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">definitely open to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">alternatives there and then sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">the same vein but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">slightly different is like animals so</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">things that are actually alive</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">and you know can feel pain and why not</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">but aren&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh sentient being right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">so sort of like beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">and the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s too broad the way i the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">i see it though the only reason that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">keep the environment up</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">is because it has secondary effects on</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">the being</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">true i think that that&#39;s great so air</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">people need to breathe so if you&#39;re yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s true um</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">i feel like it&#39;s important to have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">other animals as one of the like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">the ecosystem itself is important like</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.640" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">the planet the environment but also that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">there are other beings that have</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">and pain and culture and like all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">that also need to be taken into effect</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">and sentient life</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">is probably our more or more concern but</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">then even then it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">define our octopus is sentient they seem</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">pretty sentient to me but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">vertebrates so we don&#39;t give them any</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this debate between sapiens and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">sessions</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">and awareness versus conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">yeah uh consciousness and yeah all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">and in the body wow uh it is defined as</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">all sentient beings as like the totality</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">uh maybe not biosphere but uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">animals and entities that can feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">and um yeah can feel basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">that&#39;s it and you cannot uh ensure</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">that all sentient beings are well</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">if the environment is not well</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of implied that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">environment needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">stable at least unless of course we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">well-being of certain beings as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">possibility to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">in interesting mutations</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">caused by changes in the environment but</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about i think there</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">another the rest of the humans</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">we have staff but like if we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">a factory there&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">all of humanity but also the local</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">humans right there&#39;s like the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">are right</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">there but there&#39;s also like depending on</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">how how much impact you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">there&#39;s also just all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">right you if you live</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">next to a factory but you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">customer or staff or a supplier or a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">competitor but like you still</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">live nearby and don&#39;t want to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">crap yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">and i think that for me anyway omni win</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">like win so that&#39;s kind of the omni</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the all</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">that the win part is like where were</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">they before</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">and where are they now right like if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">have this thing there did it improve</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">life for them right and for all of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">it might be it improves it in this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">but takes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">them in this way so it&#39;s like an overall</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">guys like our competitors are probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">going to be worse off that we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">right except that they&#39;re all still</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">humans so they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna breathe clean air you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">switched out as well that seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">semantic like says less mantex but i</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">think it will actually be super</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">because you know there there&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">like how much free speech is to free</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">speech if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">are too open then you actually hurt</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">yourself like it ends up kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">the same thing like here&#39;s the areas</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">that we do and don&#39;t consider winning</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">and sort of things that play so our</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">competitors as humans yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">the the competing organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">maybe don&#39;t operate under these same</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">go pound sand we don&#39;t care uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">our actual goal is to put you out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">business and hopefully employ all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">your employees</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">get gainfully and hopefully better than</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">you were and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">in that rain everyone wins</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">counted in in omni one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">just about people and animals</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">and then what yeah what areas are we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">looking at because like i</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">people care they have an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">attachment to their resources right</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">whether they&#39;re rich when they get their</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">yacht whether they</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">like that&#39;s not there&#39;s like a real</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">concern and not concern right i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">care for costing our competitors a yacht</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">i do care if we&#39;re costing people food</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">clothing shelter right their basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s like the perceived impact versus</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">the actual</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">if that makes sense so like i guess for</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">now it&#39;s called like improved</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">life stability or access to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">needs maybe like improved access to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">does it give access to water okay does</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">it give access to cleaner water if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">had crappy water</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">before um and then like i think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">flip side of that is lessening harm</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">kind of the doing good and stopping</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">doing bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">one thing that i&#39;m just going to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">here because i don&#39;t know how to put it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">is just put long term wins</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">not short term so our future selves</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">the future humans the future animals um</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">because right if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">taking someone&#39;s bus if we&#39;re if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">if we have a competitor and they go out</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">of business</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">that maybe they&#39;re in their short term</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">disadvantage but the ultimate long-term</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">we&#39;re doing business in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">externally helps</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">them um uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re long the long term</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">they&#39;ll benefit from moving and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">from an extractive job to uh right i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">good point yeah like emphasis on overall</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">sort of long term</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">just because it does something good</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">today okay but what&#39;s that gonna do in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">a year five years ten years if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">a long-term win then it&#39;s not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">win you&#39;re just you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">borrowing from the future to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">i think with this when short ones are</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">great but i think you&#39;re totally right</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">that long term is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">the more important part</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">it also feels like in the um broader</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">they don&#39;t take like that that we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">gas and oil companies to stop it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">okay but is there an alternative because</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">i still drive a car</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t there like there&#39;s like the short</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">and long term for competitors for us</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">and meaning that i don&#39;t want our</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">business to necessary together tech</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">to go and dismantle other people&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">without giving a replacement right like</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">without there being an actual</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s easier to to put all of our</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">externalities on the oil and gas</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">companies instead of on myself for</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">driving a car</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like if i had an</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">alternative if i had an alternative fuel</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">source an</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">alternative way of transportation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">would be more short so yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">why i&#39;m adding all</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">this but long term i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">really important for improving life</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">access to basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">yes so um i mean to be an</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">omni when i&#39;m i&#39;m thinking through the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">the phrasing to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">let me say it the long way it would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">if there are any it is any harm to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">anyone than they&#39;re being any long-term</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">harm they&#39;re being compensated for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">um i see so like</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">it seems a bit like trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">fairness or like if it can&#39;t be totally</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">fixed okay you&#39;re having this bad so</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">what can we do to help</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">do we give you something do we pay you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">do we move you like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">yeah because i don&#39;t think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">a a requirement</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">that every action has to benefit</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">or equally benefit everyone right but in</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">it should not harm anyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">but sometimes you can&#39;t even do that so</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">at least you can compensate</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">i i i like that which i think kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">moves towards the like progress over</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">perfection</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">but like that being countered by okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">where there are going to be limits right</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">like if it improves for these</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">90 of people but like these 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">have to go into slavery</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">well no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m also how we had said before</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.800" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">that a win</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">is an improvement right an</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">improvement in any of these areas if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">just have it for life satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">but for instance i know this is not our</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">realm but if we&#39;re big enough it might</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">be all around one day or someone might</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">wear like a ranch right a free-range</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">cattle ranch</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">is not kind to cows but it&#39;s kinder to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">cows than what</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">what the other option is right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">like unless</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">if i&#39;m eating meat i want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">choose the nicer one even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">still passing externalities onto</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">the environment right it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">improvement on what is what is currently</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">being done</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">right so for the compensation i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessarily even just long</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">i think like even if it&#39;s a short-term</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">harm if you can compensate them you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">probably still would</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">it might not be well if you have a guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">if if we put jeff bezos out of business</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">are we going to pay him</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">i think we&#39;re saying that corporations</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">are immune from</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">right and so thus is unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">i&#39;m saying yeah he&#39;s a human</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">right so that&#39;s where they&#39;re perceived</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">right like that thing of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">employment in an organization and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.119" style="s2">continue profit we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">like as long as you can meet your needs</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.119" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">no he he</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">is worth billions of dollars if we crash</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">his business he is no longer worth that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s direct</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">to him right we&#39;re causing him</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">short-term harm</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">the question is are we obligated within</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">this framework to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">compensate him i mean for him it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">still kind of long-term harm because</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">you know if you crush the systems around</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">he&#39;s also never going to have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">that again but we&#39;re sort of trading</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">his long and short term for the long</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">term of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">yeah so i don&#39;t think trading i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">think trading falls under</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">omni when trading one person for another</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">yeah and that is not trading right if my</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">if i say that i need to dominate people</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">and have 10 slaves and blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">blah like</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not actually being harmed by not</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">doing that i&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">i i wonder if it&#39;s almost like a ranking</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">like where improving life satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">is great</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">but also kind of the last thing like if</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re lessening harm and doing long-term</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">good and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">you know giving more people access to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">basic needs that all comes above</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">just making people happier</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s still important so if if</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">someone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">he would be negatively impacted if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">took away if we created</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.040" style="s2">an amazon alternative but he would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">negatively impacted from going from</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.040" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">being a billionaire to going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">someone who has all of their needs and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">wants met and doesn&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">about someone coming in with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">guillotine</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">i think he would also be better off in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">the long term but at the same time he</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">might not feel that way but the amount</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">of people who would be better off the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">workers the customers</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">everyone else is like right but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">nearly infinitely better off without</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">amazon</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">and his because his long-term um</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">cost to the planet not just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">environment but also that it&#39;s it is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">monopoly it is you know and growing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">power and gaining stuff is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">what does it look like before our</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">alternative what does it look like after</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">alternative yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">we acknowledge jeff bezos is going to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">from rich to not rich</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:06.800" style="s2">or really extremely rich to not so</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">to rich but not as you know neutron meat</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.800" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">from stupidity we&#39;re okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s one person</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">and one person is like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">it was improved all of these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">lives truly right we gave them actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">did his satisfaction go down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">multiples of the millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">satisfaction that went up right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">not necessarily what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">because that&#39;s just philosophy and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">you know like uh not philosophy you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">i&#39;m whatever i&#39;m trying to say the train</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">track and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t just make a decision on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">how it&#39;s going to affect</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">dilemma happiness but um in this case i</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">feel like yeah we can because it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">but also jeff bezos also gets long-term</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">benefits he might be rich he still has</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">to breathe he still has to eat food</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s such a thing as imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">pain and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">loss of a million dollars uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">i believe imaginary pain if you are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">uh loss of house or like shelter food</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">and everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">i just cannot uh imagine it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">thing as</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">harm being done to environment or to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">like a living creature</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">causing physical pain and uh internal</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">dissatisfaction caused by</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">being poorer in terms of very uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">like um imaginary values like the dollar</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s not the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">so yeah one way to kind of say what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">hearing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">reduce someone&#39;s access to basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">if we&#39;re reducing your access to a yacht</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">as an externality for what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not considering that harming you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s go ahead oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">uh i was just trying um i wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s uh also exactly not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">as uh taking something by force</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">or um we would be taking uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">his yacht by playing the same game</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">he&#39;s already playing so um</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like part of the game this</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">being um was upper apprehended</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">by some better technology or some better</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">way of uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">running a company so it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">a harm it&#39;s a direct consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">playing the same game</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">well yes but it&#39;s a game a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">game you know i&#39;m just saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">i think we&#39;re moving past that principle</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">when we say omni win</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">we&#39;re saying even even if they</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">put themselves in this thing we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to not have them be</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">harmed by it</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">um but just if it just depends on how we</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">define harm</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">right because even if even if</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">jeff bezos deserves it or even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">he if we shouldn&#39;t reduce him</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">past those basic needs right even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">that saves</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it saves another life we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">have to have that whole discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">um which i think the basic needs part</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">because to me that&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say you are jeff bezos and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how much this house is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">worth i&#39;m gonna say 100 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">and we hurt him so badly he doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">a house anymore because he</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">had to well come on you can get a house</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">you just can&#39;t have your 100 million</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">dollar house right so there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">different but like basic needs to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to stay like everyone gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">the same wage across the board but if</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">there is that wage right which is around</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">60 000</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">that makes people happy how much is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">we&#39;re doing raising people to that line</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">versus the amount of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">dropping</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">as long as it&#39;s not below that line</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">sorry yeah your 10 million dollar house</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">is just not my heartbreak</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s it&#39;s that yes we</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">drastically impacted one person but we</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">this many people to to that level right</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">we doubled their income from 30 000 to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">60 000 or whatever those metrics are</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">we gave people access to actual goods</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">feeding off of all of the workers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">laborers all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">there&#39;s something about like a line that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">is like is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">helping people up to that line and is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">dropping people below that line</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like the true version of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">staying you know is it like</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">a rising tide carries all ships or or</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">there you go it&#39;s that but like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">actual version of that where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">trying to adjust the water</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">some of that might you know if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">super high ship</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s where the analogy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">falls apart where i guess some of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">made from ice and we&#39;re taking them</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">well yeah like we&#39;re actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">raise the baseline for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">we carry people that are under the level</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">but if you&#39;re over it and now people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">sort of getting closer to your level</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t care about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.839" style="s2">and if you dropped a bit are you below</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">the water no then we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">yeah it might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">writing up a framework that says here</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">are the things that we&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">and do</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">here are the things we&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">and not do accidentally or indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">and here are the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">that might happen but we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">so right so we want to get people up to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">our first priority i think is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">get as many people as you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">up to that that uh satisfaction line</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">and if some people fall down we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">care but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not out to get them yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">just that we&#39;re that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">game a playing its course and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">also playing a game over here</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">like if you&#39;re playing a game of soccer</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">and part of your roles is we need all</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">the balls in the area</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">and we want to play a game of of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">a football next to them if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">ball that now they don&#39;t own like and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">that ruins their game</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">sorry but not sorry</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s all all voluntary so</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">we are not forcing people to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">or to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">experience a lot of a big house</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all uh a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">the environment of our mindsets as</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">human race just changing to value</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">different things than</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">are valued by game a so it&#39;s all fair</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">game to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">yeah i mean some of the concepts i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">of omni win would also say</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">or something i think people thought is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">that it would be anything that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">that has like no negative things like</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t even be</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">having a rich person have to lose their</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">yacht and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">um but i guess we&#39;re saying we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">shooting for that high</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">of the definition though</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">i would also add that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">there is um the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">result of some uh economic systems and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">dictatorship the consequence was</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">to uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.240" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">everyone down to a certain size of uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">not being very wealthy so to speak so</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">uh in like in russia or in poland</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">uh everyone was poor so it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">not everyone but most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">were equal but equal in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">what i&#39;m thinking about here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">actively actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">get everyone the possibility of having a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">life like uh standard rich person</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that we are going to take</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">all the yachts and burn them</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">it would be nice if everyone could get</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:48:00.580" style="s2">and access at least</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:03.639" style="s2">well access to whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.580" end="00:48:03.639" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">pleasure experience they want for</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">if there&#39;s um if many people want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">have or at least go yachting for some</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">uh part of omniwin should would be to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">actually make it happen or create</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">conditions under which people can</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">uh build themselves or something like</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">so we are trying to bring the standard</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">to uh the level of uh maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">jeff bezos but um like to reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">reasonably rich someone right</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s where it gets weird</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.559" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s not our goal to actively</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">reproduce others resources</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">but it will be a byproduct just because</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">of how game a works right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">every customer that we take away from</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">amazon is reducing the</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">eventually have but</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the nature of the game and not</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">our directly intended outcome</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">right i like that not actively trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">reduce the resources or satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">um although i&#39;m still gonna constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">in the group don&#39;t kick me out if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">like yeah we&#39;ve got visa says wealth in</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">half</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">like it could still celebrate i can</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">still be part of it but they like to try</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">to bring it back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">what are we creating as opposed to what</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.119" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">are we destroying</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">even if i want to do both yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s just a better conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">have around</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">like hey look at how many people we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">lifted above the satisfaction line as</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">hey look at these three people that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">dragged down</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">like well who cares they&#39;re still above</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">the satisfaction line that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">look at these ten thousand people that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">we&#39;ve set out way better story to tell</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">and i think just more effective i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">it&#39;s generally more effective to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">towards something than away from</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">i like it we have our what resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">meant what omni means and what wind</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s pretty epic</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">i was just thinking the other day i i</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">looked up the definition of omni-win in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">um the game b library and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">it was not</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">i did not find any value in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">it was it did not uh it did not provide</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">me any satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">uh no one won in the definition of omni</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">wins</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">yeah and in honesty honestly i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">that what we defined here really fits</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">the ideal of omniwin</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">um but i think it&#39;s a good realistic</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">compromise and what we mean when we say</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">omni win in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">um together tech yeah and i think you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">just brought up a good point where like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">maybe isn&#39;t the ideal and this is at</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">least partially sort of like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what you call it the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">launch stage where we&#39;re we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">deeply in a game a world and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">figure out how if it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">as it gets more and more sort of clout</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">and more powerful as it starts to figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">out the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">the best way to to play the games i</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">think well it&#39;s the clearer</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:26.960" style="s2">defection will probably have to re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">yeah redefine some terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">the expanding the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">right or whatever we&#39;re doing we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">omni win ever like we can&#39;t do that of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">course for what you&#39;re saying right</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">we&#39;re in game a world but like</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">constantly expanding what that possibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">um again and everything&#39;s voluntary so</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">everyone&#39;s at this level we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">to tax all these people to move them to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">this level because we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">power to do that even if we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">it&#39;s about creating voluntary things</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">increase everyone&#39;s standard of living</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">who wants to participate</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">and so doing happens to cost other</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">people their standard of living</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">but i do keep thinking what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">conservative and libertarian friends</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">watch this discussion their fear would</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">they would it would trigger them in</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.200" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">that we definitely don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">individual sovereignty which is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">very important to libertarians</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">is something that we hold dear and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">above i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">so i think one thing we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">kind of list out our values</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">and then uh you know a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">conservative friends have</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:39.240" style="s2">concerns about i mean i i know several</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">of us in this group are very</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.240" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">anti-capitalism um</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">but i i don&#39;t know that our goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">extinguish that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">but just put it in its proper place um</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">although i guess we haven&#39;t explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">discussed that so i could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">wrong on several people&#39;s opinions but</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">um my goal is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">absolutely to dismantle capitalism but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">so we haven&#39;t had that discussion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">not like i</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">i like what you&#39;re saying because it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about jeff bezos and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think he&#39;s the problem it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:14.720" style="s2">and no one&#39;s a problem but like the vast</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">majority of people who do see capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.720" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">as a positive and so hearing</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna dismantle it makes them think</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">they can never start a small business</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:22.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">it&#39;s all gonna go through the government</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.000" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s all gonna it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">well you just don&#39;t start a small</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">business in the same way it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">can find a group of people start a</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">own it until it&#39;s gone but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">yeah in an omni win world you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">going to start it at coffee shop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.319" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">for profit that like it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s based very much in gaming</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be taking all the risk</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">yourself so i think it really is</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">painting a brand new picture that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">have never seen they&#39;ve only seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">the capitalism picture and they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">the communism picture or like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">the socialism picture and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">only two realities that they&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">presented where it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">government that takes away your</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">sovereignty and runs things and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">if they sort of work somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">efficiently it</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">can be good in areas and capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">where we have these giant for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">running everything and we&#39;ve seen time</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">and time again that neither one works</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">but you&#39;ll get people need your reaction</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">oh you don&#39;t want giant corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">run things well the only other option is</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">a giant government i</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want that yeah so i think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2">an interesting exercise for us to kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:37.520" style="s2">of list out values</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">and even in a priority order if we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.520" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">because i think it&#39;d be interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">think we would end up with still</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">individual sovereignty at and individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">responsibility which is important to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">some of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">um groups is still pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">pretty darn high on the list if not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">very top which</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">you know i&#39;m an american and we think</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">individuality is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">is the most important thing so i could</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">be i&#39;m biased</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">by where i grew up but</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">uh yeah anyway so that might be an</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">interesting kind of next</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:09.920" style="s2">step absolutely i was gonna just bring</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">in what radicand</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">reddick had said earlier of um</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">like the the perceived slight right like</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">thinking you&#39;re gonna lose a million</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">does isn&#39;t maybe the same point but i</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">think in this case it is it&#39;s how trump</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">got elected right like the perceived</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">loss of freedom the perceived loss of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">potential in the future</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">is huge for people and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:33.839" style="s2">yes if they hear me say dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:35.280" style="s2">capitalism that&#39;s all they hear is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.839" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">oh my god we&#39;re all gonna be standing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.280" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">long bread lines right which is like yep</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">that&#39;s history</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">but this is something new and different</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">and so like what does capitalism give</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">yes like freedom individuality</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">innovation yep all of that&#39;s here right</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">and so i think that yes values</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s precisely the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">the capitalism gives freedom it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.119" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">that makes capitalism work and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">what makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">this precisely what makes it better and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">what makes it win against uh socialism</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">but yeah sorry but just people</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">do not see it that way because</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">again on purpose lack of education and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">too much of propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">yeah and and how much more innovation we</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">would have if if</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have to struggle so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">meet our basic</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">needs every day um</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.839" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">you know put so much energy into that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">which is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">necessary and is wasted um</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">that that could be fulfilled in another</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">way and that would give us the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">i think a majority of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">if given nothing to do would strive to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">make the world a better place</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s an inbred not even in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">bread but that&#39;s a natural part of our</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">chemistry um and that has been something</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">that&#39;s been stifled</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">i&#39;m less concerned with the size of</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">than the knowledge that like somebody</p>

<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">right i think that is at its nature</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;re hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">solve here is well hey if we take all</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">these people and lift them all</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">because you can&#39;t sort of worry about</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">the you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">lofty ideals and those cut sort of grand</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">plans</p>

<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">yeah the main motto and message</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:56.480" style="s2">and slogan is we need you as you</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">and not you as a lawyer or</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.480" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">like a worker or or you know anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.520" style="s2">could do we don&#39;t want you to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">anything like</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">special that we think uh you should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">like pretty much everyone is doing uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:14.079" style="s2">pretty much most of the people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">working to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.079" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">someone else&#39;s dream right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">what we need is uh like you to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">you and that&#39;s the best use of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">you that can possibly be yep</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re right out of time so</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:33.760" style="s2">maybe this is a good place to stop and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">we can all kind of brainstorm on our own</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.760" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">about values and then sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">sounds good i was just looking up i</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize you&#39;re out of time but</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">that makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:44.319" style="s2">um like quizzes that are for your values</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">would you like me to find one and we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.319" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">send it out and then you can like take</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">it and see</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">what your values are that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">going to be doing because i can never</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.480" style="s2">remember what my values</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">are which one&#39;s first yeah if you run</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.480" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">across any of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">um probably good to share in the game b</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">projects group then everyone can see</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">yeah yeah might be good to just like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">find i don&#39;t know five or so like fairly</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">quick quick ones just to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">outputs</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">are because i know that a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">tests are garbage and also</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">you don&#39;t need it it&#39;s also a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:11.599" style="s2">values that the ranking you want we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.559" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">like yeah we don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.599" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">those values but they won&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">until you&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">so yeah i think if we find a few of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">we can all sort of go through them and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">which ones actually seem to work and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">you just try to go through those as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">group after like figure out what is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">organization&#39;s value as opposed to each</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">individual one</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">yeah and i would i&#39;d be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">the organization&#39;s value if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">done your own</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">then be sure and do that i&#39;d i have two</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">or three lists some of my values</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">so i&#39;ve done that exercise and and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">have it documented so</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;ll just be kind of picking out which</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">ones work for the group and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">but yeah bring bring your brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll flush it out together</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">all right sounds good and yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">this is an important exercise because</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">for me the values is like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">matter what our individual ones are it</p>
