<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">second branch and in fact uh where it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">all started actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">in 1996. and uh on anjin&#39;s prompting i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">going to tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">he thought that was helpful to frame but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">what is this thing justification systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a theory of human</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">self-consciousness and the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">of the culture person plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll talk a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">exactly you mean by that but if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">recall from the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">matter life mind and culture represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">different planes of existence in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">in that language system</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">so now let me tell you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">uh just justification systems theory so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">the first thing i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">is just let&#39;s orient to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">because the uh the argument is this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">pretty much where</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">ever you look uh that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">very much like</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">fish and water uh that the person</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">culture plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">uh is everywhere around us and we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">through it but we don&#39;t always see</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">uh it uh as much so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">so uh let me tell a little story so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">1996</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;m deep in the struggling with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">uh i&#39;ve learned a lot about evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned a lot about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">psychotherapy and psychology that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">i&#39;m doing my dissertation on</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">psychotherapy psychodynamics around</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">psychotherapy i&#39;m learning</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s daunting on me that a key issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">which you&#39;ll see a little bit elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">here is as the evolution of language</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">takes off</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">we&#39;re then forced to give accounts we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">forced to justify our actions</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">and then we really become the justifying</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">ape</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">um and the argument is that we basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">are oriented generally to justify our</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">actions in accordance with social</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">um meaning sort of the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">we&#39;re positioned in the social world so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not inclined to give explanations</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">or accounts</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">that really diminish us now it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">now it&#39;s certainly the case that many</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">people sometimes do seem to give</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">accounts of themselves that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">diminish them</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">and i actually was substituting for i</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">was working in a neuropsych rehab</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">uh when this idea really popped i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">had been playing around with those with</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">um and then i had to fill in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">went on vacation it was over the holiday</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">and i was then in the psychiatric domain</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">and then i did a eval and a woman who</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">came in and just made a suicide attempt</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">and she her father had died six months</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">earlier i don&#39;t remember exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">she was about late 20s mid-30s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">she lived by herself in borderline</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">poverty</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">very much isolated her narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">is a narrative you see in the clinical</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">world fairly regularly unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">she lived in rural vermont we grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">rural vermont um and her father was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">raging alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">who dominated his submissive timid</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">um and she had an older brother</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">now one of the striking things about</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">this woman was how</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">she totally saw herself as inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">ineffective really</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">hated herself uh and basically and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">for example her iq of memory serves was</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">somewhere in the 110 ballpark she</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">thought ourselves as stupid</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">i think objectively most people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">founders relatively attractive she saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">herself as ugly</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">essentially she was downgrading herself</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">on every indicator now</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">if you are oriented to justify yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">why on earth would somebody down rate</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">and yet we do see it in a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">population subset of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">well here&#39;s the dynamic that where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">exception proves the rule so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">um when she was growing up her older</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">brother is four or five years older</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">started becoming defiant of her</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">alcoholic father uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">and as an adolescent he started to rebel</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">and they got into physical fights and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">would be physically beaten</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">uh by his father and she remembered a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">specific incident</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">uh where he was her father was beating</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">her uh brother</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">um and he was he said to her he said why</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">can&#39;t you be more like your obedient</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">sister</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">and that&#39;s stuck in her head she told me</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">that story okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">well as she relayed the story and i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">thinking my frame was oh my gosh our</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">self-concept pertains to the way we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">justify ourselves on the social stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">the social influence dynamics something</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">really clicked where the exception</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">proves the rule here</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">think about it so she&#39;s eight her father</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">experiences defiant from a 12 year old</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">boy who&#39;s going to be a lot stronger</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">than she is and he kicks the boy&#39;s ass</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen if she asserts</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">that she&#39;s a valuable person that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">smart that she</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">warrants power that he&#39;s treating her</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">unfairly what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">well very likely uh the calculus would</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">be you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be beaten you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">to have your physical safety put an</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">obvious risk so what happens then is if</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">you turn against the self and you say</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">i&#39;m actually not worthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">what that justifies then is submission</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">indeference</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">uh it&#39;s basically a white flag and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">you look at the animal kingdom you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">white flags all the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">okay and so here we had a self-concept</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">system that turned against itself but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">we understood the adaptive history</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">we see that submission and deference was</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">essentially demanded by her</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">authoritarian abusive father</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">and all of a sudden the exception plays</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">the rule</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">now the narrative i tell on this one is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">that i this clicks on me and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">up and uh you know am i really excited</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">and i start chatting with my fellow</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">uh doctoral students i was a doctoral</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">student in the university of vermont at</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">uh and i&#39;m explaining oh my gosh this</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:21.839" style="s2">of justification i now can figure out at</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">least with this case how the exception</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">proves the rule</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">and maybe we really are justifying and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">can start to see this in my clients and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">you know and it turns out that i look up</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">the clock and it&#39;s 6</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">20. now my wife was waiting for me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">this is of course before the days of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">cell phones the mid-1990s here</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">um and i&#39;m like oh god i&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">be home at six all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">so i said all right i gotta go head out</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">into my car get in my car</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">we only live about five minutes away we</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">live in a little town called</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">winooski which is near burlington i get</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">in my car two seconds after i get out</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">all of a sudden they&#39;re doing road work</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">and what should have taken me to five</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">minutes to get home takes me 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">to get home so i walk in that door at 6</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">35 and i&#39;ve been late</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">earlier a week earlier and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to wait to keep your spouse</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">half an hour waiting so she&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">there pissed um</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s like where you been and without</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">two seconds worth of thought i look and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">say it&#39;s the traffic</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right they&#39;re doing can you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">believe it they&#39;re doing traffic okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s why i&#39;m late all</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">right i didn&#39;t have to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">they didn&#39;t take any delay there it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">okay now if we then back up and we look</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">at actually what happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">20 minutes of the reason i was late was</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">because i was paid attention myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">obsessed with my theory wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">discussing that okay 10 minutes was</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">because i was traffic</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">right it was because of the traffic it</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t take my mind</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">four-year-old daughter and two-year-old</p>

<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">and they were playing initially and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">they got into it a bit and i was just</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">watching them</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">my son hit my daughter a little bit and</p>

<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">knocked him down okay he starts crying i</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">assure my machine and said hey</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">what happened here my four-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">looks at me and he fell</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">okay notice it explains why he&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">ground and crying but it subtracts some</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">key elements of the information</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">the autumn a justification filter all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">a sudden you&#39;re given accounts</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">okay so if we situate ourselves in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">what you see here</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">is what i&#39;m going to invite you to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">that justification dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">in the way in which we explain ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">are absolutely ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">i mean also i find a lot of mileage when</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;m doing clinical work</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">uh as we start to get into people i</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:40.839" style="s2">invite them to think about their</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">narrative they&#39;re telling me an event</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">about what happened or who they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">what they get into it i&#39;ll often reflect</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">sounds like your justification narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">in fact narrative psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">psychotherapy is a big deal i add the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">word justification</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">because you can then once you do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">you see the structural and functional</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">organization you see that actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to legitimize what is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">in relation i&#39;m going to be arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">persons behaving in culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a psychologist by the name of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">peter osario who argues that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">definition of a person</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">which actually is different than a human</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">being a definition of a person</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">is an entity that can self-consciously</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">justify themselves on the social stage</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">and take account and responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">for why they do what they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">and finally we&#39;re going to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:32.639" style="s2">also as this network of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.639" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">a network of propositional knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">this is a ubiquitous concept</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">and when you learn to see the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">through the lens of justification you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">see it everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">like right here like i am justifying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">you that justification systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">is a good way to think about the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">okay so to now position ourselves i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">going to locate just</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">in the context of the unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">where since we&#39;re all fans of john</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">verveigh or at least i</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">project that out into the world uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">going to make connection to his work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">a theory of propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">we&#39;re then going to go back in time and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">identify the problem of justification</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">how it would have emerged in the course</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">of the evolution of language and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">how that sets up</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">a thing called the updated tripartite</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">model which is a model</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">of human consciousness and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk briefly about the culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">person plane of existence and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">allude uh to the brilliant work of peter</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">lindberg and talk to about culture war</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">2.0</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">and the current state of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">justification systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">and their fragmented pluralism as we go</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">through this time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">okay so we want to locate this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">this overarching</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">system so the unified theory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">knowledge tree identifies eight key</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">around knowledge justification</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">investment influence adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">development well-being and mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">this course fundamentally wisdom so now</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">let&#39;s locate it in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">domain we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">last time we covered the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">which orients us to the first branch and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">justification systems theory is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">joint point</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">between mind and culture on the tree and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">it sets the stage then to give us</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">a updated tripartite model of human</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">and the evolution of the culture person</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s what this step picks</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">right here is the joint point between</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">mind and culture on the tok</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">a theory of culture that includes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">of human knowing including science that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">actually becomes a big deal later on</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">not necessarily in this talk but in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">other contexts it offers what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">reverse</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">engineering hypothesis about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">evolution of human reason giving</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">and the evolution of our propositional</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">um and then we can let&#39;s move into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">domains of human consciousness that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">maps</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">okay so uh i&#39;m going to argue that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">offers us a useful way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">human consciousness we can now get</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">situated</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">so if we take our take a second here um</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to identify three broad</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">domains one is the experiential self</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">this also another word for this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">phenomenology this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">goes offline when you fall asleep and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">when you come online it integrates your</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">senses and gives you your point of view</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">in the world your first person</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">perspective behind your eyes between</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">your ears</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">that no one else can get direct access</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">to and have a private self</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">that&#39;s a narrator and a public self</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">which you can then report on</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to introduce another</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">vocabulary that will to overlap some</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">and that is there&#39;s a thing called mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">1a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">okay this is this is a model of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">consciousness and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">differentiate it from a model of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">neurocognition although these two</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">domains need to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">uh to make the clear some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">know of steven pinker&#39;s work</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">1997 i think it was published</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">about how the nervous system as an</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">because it&#39;s mediated through</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">but relevant for us are the two other</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">domains of mind one of which is mind two</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">so when i use the word line two and some</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">other settings or if i use the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">experiential sentence mine two refers to</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">uh the reason i believe that this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">really crucial is because and according</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">from my vantage point</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">we&#39;re enormously confused in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">understanding of how to talk about the</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">in fact as i will talk about next time</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">the problem of psychology is very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">the fact that we lack a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">grammar that allows us to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">talk about mind and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">and what the mind123 map does is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">tells you actually how to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">that and give rise to a much more</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">vocabulary for our purposes</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">justification systems theory is about</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">mind three it&#39;s emergence it&#39;s storm</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">it&#39;s structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">so uh let&#39;s just touch briefly on john</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">vervicky&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">ps of cognition uh there&#39;s john talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">about them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">on rebel wisdom and lost ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">also includes greg thomas it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">half hour presentation there and john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">four piece of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">start with procedural knowing this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">the most basic forms of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">um it connects insakes now certainly you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">can get very very complicated forms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">but most obviously our procedural</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">knowing that&#39;s then dropped into our</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">habits becomes surely automatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">and is generally the least conscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">forms uh that john</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">talks about perspectival knowing refers</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">to point of view integration</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">senses into a perceptual whole it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">connected to this screen</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">the global neuronal workspace of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">subjective experience if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">throw a bernie bars reference in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">john also talks about participatory</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">which really is when you start to engage</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">your perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">regards to the whole animal arena</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">environment and then you&#39;re engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">particular kind of novel</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">task that isn&#39;t reducible to procedures</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">that you already learned but are new</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">so when you&#39;re first driving you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">engaged in a lot of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">driving and then you can reduce a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">that for procedural knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">okay and then finally there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">propositional knowing which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">language based knowledge reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">reason giving</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">i often point out that us as human</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">beings are both</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">primates and we are persons</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:15.280" style="s2">um and we can very much align these</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">three domains of knowing the first three</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.280" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">p&#39;s with our primate</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">in other words we share uh procedural</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">perspectival and participated norm with</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">the primate kingdom in fact we share it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">with lots of the animal kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">yet the advanced symbolics and tactical</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">propositional knowing well</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s uh what makes us human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">quite unique uh because it enables us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">become fully functioning</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">persons so</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">um justification systems theory provides</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">an evolutionary framework for them</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">for propositional knowing and then how</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">it shapes</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">um human self-consciousness and culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">it enables us to understand a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">engineering lock and key formulation</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">that gives rise to this map updated</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">and helps explains the processes that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">give rise to the evolution of culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">across the last several tens of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">it is something to that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">explained because if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">archaeological record we see over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:15.840" style="s2">last 50</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">75 to 50 000 years uh basically a human</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">big bang uh where we see the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">of culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">transforming how humans interact with</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">the environment uh of course the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">archaeological record is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">is the technological material culture of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">things that are left behind</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">but there&#39;s a huge amount of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">that suggests that this thing has</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">exploded over the last 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.559" style="s2">just posits that humans have a elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">self-consciousness system because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.559" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">language creates a thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">problem of justification and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">highlight</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">exactly what that is but the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">answer is because of language humans</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">become the only animal that has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">why it does what it does um first there</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">are actions and motives and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">and then with language self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">reasoning must emerge</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">i also want to be very clear here that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">the rest of the animal kingdom is very</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">in both its mental life and its</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">but there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">communicating</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">why you have to do what you did or why</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">you did what you did</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">as opposed to engaging in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">other kinds of communications</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">um just hang out with your dog sometime</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">and try to get it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">to give you a reason why it did what it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">did you can hang out with your dog in an</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">unbelievably rich participatory way uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">but getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">your dog to explain why it did what it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">did um is a totally different problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">in fact uh my friend joe mikulski had an</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">opportunity to have lunch</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">uh or a special dinner can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">exactly with jane goodall uh and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">very familiar with this he asked her you</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">do chimps as far as you&#39;re aware ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">justify their actions</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">uh and your answer was a reality no they</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">have very very</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">many advanced mental abilities but no</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">um so there are three basic postulates</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">justification systems theory uh the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">first is the evolution of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">language must have created the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">problem of justification</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">which and i won&#39;t get into it too much</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">actually breaks down into three</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">different related problems one of which</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">is the analytic problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">another is the personal problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">third is the social problem of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">that is the adaptive dynamic problem the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">consequence is the human</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">self-consciousness system</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">functions as a justification and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">gives rise to specifiable dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">relations with the subjective self and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">should say here the interpersonal world</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">that means this is the design features</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">that then match to the adaptive problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">and you will see this with the shape and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">structure and domains and functional</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">that we see with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">finally just provides a frame for</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">understanding the rapid evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">human culture over the past year and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">nature structure function of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">person plane of existence that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">three postulates they weave together</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">so postulate one human language resulted</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">in the emergence of the adaptive problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">so we can start here with wherever</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">language emerges</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">and we can argue that initially what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">get is you get you have shared</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">intentionality cooperation around big</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">items certainly for a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">time humans are engaged in intense</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">social cooperation this is long before</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">um symbolic language at least and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">certainly in this model would have taken</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">uh and you can have gesturing you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">have memetic communication meaning we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">match each other we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">all sorts of different kind of shared</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">attention and then what will happen then</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">is that shared attentional space then</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">gives rise for the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">tagging uh symbolic tagging which will</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">then capture various objects various</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">activities</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">uh you say things like antelope there or</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">kill</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">uh these will capture various elements</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">okay this although this is important</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">this is not exactly the tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">uh that leads to the big bang from this</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.919" style="s2">uh perspective in transition</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">what happens is when the development of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.919" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">arrangement of a symbolic syntactical</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">structure that leads to propositions</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">there is the mammoth let&#39;s start the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">hunt notice these are propositional</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">claims</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">all of a sudden a propositional claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">activates a totally another</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">kind of response that says why should we</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">we might get killed okay when we say</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">just kill that&#39;s not to say that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">there would be no way to negotiate a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">kill but you cannot negotiate whether a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">command to kill</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">with the dynamic of justification</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">without a propositional set of claims</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">once you have propositional claims then</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">all of a sudden you get what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">question answer dynamics and dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">okay why because a propositional claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">sets the stage for a truth claim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">what the depth propositional is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">in definition which then in turn gives</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">rise to the potential for a counter</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">factual</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">i.e maybe that&#39;s wrong okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">and now what that does is that then</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">allows for the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">gadget of a question that then poses the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">opportunity that maybe the negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">a guy by the name of rory bashkar often</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">expands his critical realism into</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">dialectical critical realism</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">because he expands from oh this is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">is wait a minute what is the negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">space we always need to create negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">space contingency considerations</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">well actually a proposition sets the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">stage for negative space contingency</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">and we see that all the time in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">capacity for questions questions then</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">raise why what where how</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">what do you mean you now get to fill in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">or question</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">or challenge it&#39;s the question answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">dynamics that fundamentally in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">remodel</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">is the tipping feedback group that sets</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">the stage for general justification</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">and this gives rise to the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">justification in general which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">determining what is and what the group</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">and this sets the stage for general</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">reasoning in the social context</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">okay and ultimately this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">create a feedback loop where individuals</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">are engaged in the process</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">of the construction of systems of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">okay so reason giving tied to outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">gives rise to traditional practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">and indeed the argument here is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">these systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">in the last 40 30 20 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">then set the stage for animistic belief</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">value systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">oral narrative traditions okay that then</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.120" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">set the stage for individual wise elders</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">who can understand the narrative history</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">of their particular tribe across the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">and bring explicating</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">sense-making systems so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">then interpret</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">debates interpret the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">animistic gods and spirits</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.240" style="s2">one&#39;s place in nature how to negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">between various conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">uh and we ultimately then see uh the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">first deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">cultural meaning making systems in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">and this is what is meant by cap culture</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">delineates how dialogue gave rise to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">argumentation and justification</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">in fact they come up with a strikingly</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">parallel theory</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">the one i developed uh 15 years prior to</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">so now i want to but the justification</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">hypothe</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">hypothesis into systems theory goes much</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">further than just the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">the problem of argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">um i&#39;m a clinician and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">deeply focused on the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">people narrate to themselves and others</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">and how that relates to various elements</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">of their psyche</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">okay and how it would relate to how they</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">might construct a narrative of self</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">and where for example the shadow comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">from why do people have such radically</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">approaches and narratives like if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">talk to a husband and wife in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">why do they have such unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">different versions of reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">uh why do if you watch a football game</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">on one side you think the refs are</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">lame against you and then the other side</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">also thinks the rush lame only on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">exact opposite way cheating your team</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">why are people like that what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">filter well it has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">with the problem of the personal into</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">social dynamics of justification</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">so here we have an imaginary situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.440" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">where alpha male</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">who comes around and noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">somebody&#39;s hanging around with his</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">parabond insignificant</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">other and so we can imagine that beta is</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">attracted to alpha&#39;s mate</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">and alpha wants to know why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">spending time with her</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">why are you hanging around with my pair</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">bonded up</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">okay now this creates a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">tricky dynamic okay and by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">is going to now</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">set up all right one of our big</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">dynamics of what we need to learn at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">culture persian plane</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">which is how do you give an account for</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">your behavior we go back to my</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">four-year-old daughter her initial</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">account of why her</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">two-year-old brother was sitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">ground crying was he fat</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">okay but then i say well actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">more complicated than that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">so now somebody else can give a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">reference in relationship to that based</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">on evidence and then hold you</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">accountable</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.159" style="s2">so how do you tell the story of who you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">are and what is real</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.159" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">in an analytic sense but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">time manage all the complicated social</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">so this problem of justification then</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">sets the stage</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">so that according to it language is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">window into the mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">as such while there&#39;s much that we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">to share freely</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">when our interests don&#39;t align like with</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">alpha and beta</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">okay what we do and how we share our</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">thoughts is crucial and it&#39;s tied to an</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">absolutely essential resource</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">social influence this is the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">move other people in accordance with our</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">all right if this is true then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">social self-consciousness system</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">should have been shaped to construct</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">information about the self and the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">in a way that solves the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">personal social</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">if so we should see evidence for this</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">so this gets us to the second postulate</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">that the shape</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">design functionality of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">self-consciousness system</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">should be operating as a mental organism</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">of justification that navigates the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">social influence dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to bring us to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">central insights</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">of this guy you probably know</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">okay now let&#39;s return to alpha and beta</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">okay and we are now faced with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">question of now all of a sudden having</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">to be given an account</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">and let&#39;s imagine beta says hey</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">i hope to separate the two of you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">take her as my mini</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">after all this is an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">translation of his underlying drive and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">now let&#39;s think about that for a second</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">and think about the problem of social</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">can we imagine that this might be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">problem if he accounted for his behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">well so apparently obvious to us this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">the lens that we see through</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">what i would like to pose to you is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">you are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">and exquisitely attuned to your reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">giving and the social influence and when</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">we see somebody say something like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">you say well is that guy got a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">not to be pejorative but immediately if</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">somebody would make these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">comments from a clinical perspective i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">be like oh does this person have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">little bit of autism</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">okay autism has actually got some mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">blindness at least according to simon</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">baron cohen which means it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">to detect the social dynamics that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">associated with it so you know are not</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">attuned to these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">and you find yourself saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">unbelievably blunt things that sound</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">tone deaf and get you in trouble okay so</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">what does he generally say</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">he oh she&#39;s hey man no problem she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">teaching me to plant seeds</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">okay now what is this this could be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">lie</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to propose that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">something not so much a lie</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">here okay we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">this but we also now just immediately</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">need to say well</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">if we are in this kind of situation now</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">alpha&#39;s got to decide</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">whether or not this justification is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">legitimate or whether it hides something</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">and he&#39;s bs&#39;ing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">all of a sudden now we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">into the problem of bs which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">unbelievably central</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">to social world um and complication i</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">know john talks a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">but the idea here is that we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">talking about the evolution of lion and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">deceit although</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">obviously the distinction between</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">brings to rise that filter in filtering</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">dynamics between them but i&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">after the subtle dynamic okay which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">this is how do we fundamentally frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">and the argument here is before he is</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">ever in question beta must deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">possibility of being questioned</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">that as we walk around with the idea</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">in fact i deal with people all the time</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">with narrative about why they&#39;re okay or</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">why they better not act in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">affords that so the argument is not that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">he&#39;s prepping a lie</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">the argument is that he&#39;s finding a path</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">of narrative of activity of other things</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">that allow him to create a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">that&#39;s consistent in accordance with</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">social influence</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">and although his underlying desire may</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">well be to get close to verse that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">ultimately has an opportunity for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">kind of connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">the i am trying to have her as a mate is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">repressed</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">outside of awareness okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">in other words the dangerous impulses</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">are taken outside of what&#39;s socially</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">acceptable and put into the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">side of the subconscious portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">psyche and as soon as we say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">we&#39;re like oh my gosh where are we now</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.279" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">we&#39;re on freud&#39;s tripartite model</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">so freud of course fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">observation over the years once he first</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">discovers the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">and then develops a model for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">various domains</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">of structural function relations in uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">in the three persona of the id the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">underlying animalistic impulse that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">wants something</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">for its own pleasure versus the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">ego which is then going to operate on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">reality-based principle across time</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">and then in conflict with an</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">internalized standard from what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">socially acceptable rationale from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">idealized parent</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">that then tells you what you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">in order to get what</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">social acceptance in a societal frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:14.960" style="s2">that has certain values and rules</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">okay so the super ego then is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">internalized</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">punish yourself first so that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">internalize the standards</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">so fundamentally we&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">analystic self-centered urge</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">and an internalized standard that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">self-consciousness system now needs to</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">regulate in reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">so here&#39;s the model also this time it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">also has the topographical features</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">and relationship to the structural</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">features in regards to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">so what we&#39;re going to now see is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">the updated tripartite model has lots of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">indebtedness to freud but it also</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">updates it in relationship to modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">science and clarifies the topographical</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">and structural functional dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">relations it places them</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">on an evolutionary foundation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">going to make them consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">social cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">and was going to make it consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">sociocultural principles</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">so the domains are the experiential</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">system the private self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">system and the public self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s also then corresponds to mind 2</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">mind 3a and mind 3b</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">the mind two nonverbal is the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">emotional core of the self it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">first person view on the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">okay these are your perceptions your</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">basic drives motives emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">organized pleasure and pain we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">dialogue a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">the layering in fact this is what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">doing a lot with john verbaki and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">untangling the world not</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">is delineating the perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">participatory aspects of mind two</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">how it emerges out of mind one meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">the neurocognitive functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">processes that then become</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">conscious what are the elements the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">metaphysical elements</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">and the functional elements and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">evolutionary elements of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">um we should note that for freud when</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">freud used the term consciousness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">why i meant to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">say that in the topographical element</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">when freud used the word consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">he actually means what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">okay that is the explicit reason giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">so when if something is not explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">so freud does not differentiate between</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">perspectival perceptual consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">and self-conscious narration he just</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">uses his own consciousness which by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">way is why that topographical model is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">not ideal</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">um i&#39;m happy to take questions we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">talk about what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">experiential self</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">um how this connects into what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">episodic memory</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">um and how the self then extends through</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">time uh how</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:39.520" style="s2">animals as you get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">sophisticated you will develop an</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.520" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">implicit experience of self one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">perspective animals will demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">even things like ravens will demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">that they have access to particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">that they know things that the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">individuals don&#39;t know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">interesting so i can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">development of the experiential self</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">which is different a little bit than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">experiential screen of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">although they are definitely connected</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">we can certainly state that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">experience of red is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">different than</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">the thought and reflective narration</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">about what redness is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">and this gives a surprise to the private</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">self-consciousness system</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">which is the seat of our self-reflective</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">awareness our narrative scream of</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">net uh our semantic knowledge of self as</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">well as then that will tie in with our</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">hemisphere it will simply convalbalate</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">in a direct alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">justification systems theory but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">idea of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">something is quite different uh than the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">idea of saying something</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">so we might come across this individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">with some funky sweater on</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">and we might think to ourselves hey i</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">don&#39;t like that shirt</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look good on her but if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">say that publicly</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">that comes with a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">different implications</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">okay um and we engage all the time with</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">public private filtering i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">another little anecdote i&#39;m on many many</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">different listservs</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">about four years ago i was on a listserv</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">i was in sort of a dispute with a guy i</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">felt was really obnoxious</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">and some of my friend back channel and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">said hey what&#39;s that guy&#39;s problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">and i said oh this guy&#39;s got problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of really annoying he always</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">does this</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">hit send and guess what i had replied to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">the entire list</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">of 250 people all right and immediately</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">i noted out a jolt of pain and reached</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">toward the computer as if i could pull</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">that sent email back out from the ether</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">why what happened there is well</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">privately i could say one thing about</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">this guy i didn&#39;t want to say it to 250</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a private public filtration</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">so what do we normally say when we come</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">across these things we white lie</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">and say it looks nice why because in</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">terms of social influence dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">okay this is a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">so the public self-consciousness system</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">is what we publicly share and proclaim</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">ourselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">it&#39;s our persona the image we try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">project largely defined by audience</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">you know note i&#39;m a guy that emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">integrity i&#39;m a guy that emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">consistency but believe me if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">talking to person a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re having a conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">person b i&#39;m narrating with person a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">and boom i&#39;m totally different in many</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">ways than i&#39;m talking with person b</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">i mean what i emphasize what&#39;s justified</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">what i think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">all of that stuff is framed by who it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">that the audience is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">pay attention to yourself you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">that okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s operating always when we lie</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">deceive or manipulate others from true</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">intent</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">okay and it&#39;s going to relate deeply to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">our felt sense of our place in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">relational matrix</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">okay so now there are these three</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">domains experiential</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">well private and public that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">important to delineate but even more</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">important to get theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">sophisticated around is to identify the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">relation okay the first is the potential</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">filter this is between mind one the sub</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">non unconscious domain of neural</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">information processing and then how does</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">it become</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">we could talk about exactly that again</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a john verbake and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">primary problem so how does the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">intentional filter actually bring give</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">rise to something in</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s consciously experienced at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">perspectival level</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">there&#39;s the experiential and to freudian</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">filter</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">this refers to the dynamic attention as</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">you start to become aware of it how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">you narrate it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">and then how does your top-down</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">intentional shift begin to shift</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">based on what you want to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">to what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">and then finally the private to public</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">hey do i want to tell this person how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">i want to come across what do people</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">am i going to be an impastor whereby my</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">persona really is what what other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">see and it hides my true self</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">these are all dynamic relational</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.480" style="s2">interfaces between these different</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">domains of the human consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.480" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">so that attentional filter depends on</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">what we become aware of both in</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">perceptual awareness</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">and depending on how we narrate it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an iterative feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">that freudian filter fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">involves the way we keep the private</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">self works to keep stuff on the off the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">stage of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">i like to tell a story one of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">when we were growing up of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">when i was hanging out and most of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">were heterosexual when we were 15 16 oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">my gosh look at all the hot girls</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">he was always lukewarm okay in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">relationship to this and then in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">college uh ultimately he comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">the closet</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">okay so what do we mean by that it means</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">when he was 14</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">15 he wasn&#39;t having the same feelings he</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">was basically playing along</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">back in the 80s being gay was a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">bit different than me and today we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">more judgmental less enlightened during</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">those times his father was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">so he kept himself in the closet it</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">means that underlying his experiential</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">as that started to come onto the stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">his homosexual desires</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">the justification and public image stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">was so powerful it would</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">cut it off he would shift he would</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">repress those desires</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">until finally he got to a place where it</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">i wanna i wanna just kind of see if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">understanding how to place this</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">and if i&#39;m understanding kind of the you</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">um last week you you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.599" style="s2">like the relationship between all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">different domains</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.599" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">you can actually understand them um</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">in a united way and that helps you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">that a human</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">could be understood at the matter level</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">at the life level there&#39;s evolutionary</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">you know the different behavioral</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot easier to eat doritos when</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">and then if i&#39;m understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">correctly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">the next level the culture you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">the argument that that leap from mind to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.599" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">it was language but specifically</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.599" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">forms of justification um</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">that defined that leap and since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">so much a cultural creature today</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">you can most understand the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">the way we think about stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">by understanding this justification</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a yeah that&#39;s a very good way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">saying it let me be</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">uh sometimes language is is easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">confused around because there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">different meanings</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">uh it&#39;s capital c culture person okay i</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">wanna</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">i wanna yoke that stuff together and be</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">clear and the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">people will often point out and say wait</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">a minute animals have culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">okay um and they&#39;ll point out that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">different animals engage in different</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">you know macaque monkeys will wash</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">potatoes to learn how to wash potatoes</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">transfer those practices um there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">wonderful book by carl safina called</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">beyond words i wish it was called before</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">words but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">it tracks the very different cultures of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">things like elephants</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">uh that the killer whales wolves okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">so let me first say that little sea</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">culture or the shared set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">sort of communal values and practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.440" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">you can see these in other higher</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">animals very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">okay and and if you mean by culture just</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">the shared sense of community and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">and that gives a unique flavor to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">something that does have an</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">intergenerational learning tradition</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">then i want to be clear that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">over generalized meaning of the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">human culture and the culture person</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">plane of existence is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">absolutely transformed and defined by</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">this thing we call language</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">in particular propositional language and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">the networks of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">that then yoked together to create these</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very important difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">and so little sea culture at the animal</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">level does exist</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">but then you get into big capital c</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">culture and the nature of persons</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">no other animal other than a human being</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">is a person from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">um and and then that is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">then full explicit intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">uh then the idea of what is justifiably</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">good and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">how do you solve it and bad and then how</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">do you count yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">yes that&#39;s absolutely key and then that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">lens allows us to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">the way in which we are both persons as</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">we operate in culture and also our</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">primates</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">because we do all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">primaries do like eat doritos</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">sleep and have sex</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">is the implication from this then kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">of like in economics we</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">model oh people are these rational</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">beings and anybody in the world is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">no we&#39;re not we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">crazy and irrational and we rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:20.319" style="s2">things and have all these beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">it so kind of is the takeaway or</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.319" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">implication from this that like the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">way to understand a human</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">is not this rational reasoning being but</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">consciousness and that reasoning evolved</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">um for justification like that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">going to somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">explaining 50 facts about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily change their mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">could you like help sure sure so uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">um a couple of things there so first let</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">me say that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">word we we split off analytic truth</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">and this is one of the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">philosophy they split off analytic truth</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">claims</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">two plus two equals four okay a priori</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">truth games these are absolute</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">then there&#39;s this rationalization</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">dynamic where people to hide</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">underlying reasons</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">and they lie and they do all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what social people do</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re really after is analytic</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">truth claims</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">okay nice thing about the word</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">justification is it actually shows</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">that as a dimension okay so einstein</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">comes up with e equals m c squared in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">system that&#39;s an analytic justification</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">okay if he was late to his wife coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">home and said hey</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">you know the traffic well that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">justification it&#39;s a rationalization</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">okay justification then gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">lens to see the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">uh all the way from analytic claims okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">to uh hey let&#39;s go to the movies claim</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">uh to a defensive claim to a lie in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">i did the context of justification</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">anywhere from a con game</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">uh to a defense attorney uh and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">courtroom to the courtyard</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">uh to the lab all right so the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">thing i would say is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">be aware that we actually now with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">concept we actually now</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:58.160" style="s2">create the dimension okay of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.160" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">and philosophy tends to and we get</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">taught oh well there&#39;s truth claims and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like well actually this is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">first thing you want to do is create</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">this category</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">and then you want to divide it up</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">secondarily okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">so then the other thing is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">you will both want to see the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">we are unbelievably shaped okay anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">that speaks to the socialization of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">of our development uh if you develop if</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">you adopt a social constructionist view</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">of the importance of knowledge you will</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">then say oh my god it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">important that i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">born into you know i was born in north</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">north america northern virginia i have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">two white parents who are highly</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2">educated well that tells a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:46.000" style="s2">about me if i were born 30 000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">okay or even 30 years ago in saudi</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.000" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">arabia</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">the cultural systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">and my whole sense-making system would</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">be radically different</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">so the power of these narratives</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">historical context and shaping what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">do and what we believe and why we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">is enormous at the same time we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">primates</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">okay so then this gets into what is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">about our human nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">uh certainly one of my big struggles</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">actually this is an intersection where</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;m learning what&#39;s the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">human nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">relative to the power of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">and the answer is well it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">what lens you look at it from one level</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not that powerful at all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">primates we&#39;re going to reach for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">doritos 90</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">you can nudge people in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">yeah they rationalize but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">post hoc</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;s all brain-based here and now you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">know reward dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">the whole context is context of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">justification the reason you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">the lab is actually because the way you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:37.839" style="s2">justified</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">so believe me it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">important the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">okay so what is the intersection between</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">the cultural con</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">constructive systems and the uh up uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">upload of nature and that intersection</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">this provides that</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">frame of mind so</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m curious um</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">i&#39;m curious in in some like ways day to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">day or week to week</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">this might like this this framework</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">helps you understand stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">yeah what you see on tv or seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">argue about something in a shopping mall</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">like could you share some examples</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">of of course yeah i mean first off</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">that&#39;s how i see</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">verbal comment uh you know i i started</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">like mercer and sperber okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">um it&#39;s so deep in me that it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">transformative</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">when i was when i initially landed on</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">this i was then going to do i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">trained as an experimental</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">social cognitive psychologist and i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">then going to do research</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">i was starting to do the process of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">okay what are the predictions that it</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">makes so i can take this into the lab</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">and see if this thing actually works</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">well as i started to do that guess what</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">i realized i was doing was realized i</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">was building a justification system that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">then tested and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">okay and ultimately what then happens is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">although you can certainly do that it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">does make very clear predictions i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">the predictions are unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.559" style="s2">but ultimately what happens is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">becomes a description</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.559" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">okay it becomes a description of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">you are doing and as you are engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">uh so just watch all right so now just i</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">can&#39;t watch like a political debate</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">right obviously i&#39;m sure all of you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">this problem okay but basically what are</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:20.240" style="s2">you doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">you are essentially defending your team</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">damn goal all right so you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:27.200" style="s2">motivated to defend your team</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">and do whatever you can to justify</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.200" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">social influence for your team</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why you never answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">and in truth you&#39;re just the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">old content of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">and now we&#39;ve hired people that all they</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">do is defend the team</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">rather than actually engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">analytic problems that we have so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">all social personal that&#39;s why i have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">turn off the debates i can&#39;t even take</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">because they&#39;re so obviou if you have my</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">lens it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">obvious that you&#39;re just a corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">human being all you are is just a</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">narrating bullshitter across some other</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">predetermined motive</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">if you want to be that way fine but</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not the way to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">okay at least as far as my value system</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">so ultimately it does so it says the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">whole part there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">it opens up a whole set of well yeah why</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">am i given the reasons that i&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">all right and and what it tells you is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">actually yeah you think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">doing it but actually by design there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">a little set point that says develop</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">socially acceptable rules based on your</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.880" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">calculation</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">and start generating narrative all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">and quite frankly</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">what you&#39;ll find is just people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">engaged in mindless bs justification all</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">the damn time</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s painful and you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">yourself doing it i often refer i used</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">to refer to myself</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">as a verbal okay and then encourage</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">and and so what it does it does it will</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">be humbling a bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">okay because once you actually see it if</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not practice when you first see</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">it you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:44.160" style="s2">when i came in and realized oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">the traffic was immediately basically a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.160" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">reflex of justification that i engaged</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">in and then i saw myself doing it all</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a little humbling</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:57.839" style="s2">so yep it&#39;s everywhere like i just</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">justified by you we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.839" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">engage in justification analyses</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to ask one more question</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">and then i&#39;m going to switch to that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">are um are there synonyms here to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">justification like it&#39;s storytelling or</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">beliefs like</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:16.160" style="s2">could you help us with the like why the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">word justification and maybe how is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.160" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">different than</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">these other things we&#39;ll say ah a human</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">is a storytelling person a human&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">well just you know that&#39;s a good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">a good question uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">i guess what i would say is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:32.799" style="s2">the nexus point of so many different</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.240" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.799" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it sort of is like i fell into it</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">and it does this it does this it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">the issue is that it&#39;s the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">of proposition and legitimizing</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s propositional legitimizing so what</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">it does is it connects</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">the language system okay and it&#39;s medium</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">and then it connects it to is ought to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">in influence and investment so just</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">it makes it alive so proposition so and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">it is that intersection</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">and then you can use that intersection</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:05.119" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">with practice again this is unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.119" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">in my i mean this is i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">i landed on this idea i said law it took</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">decades for me to flush it out</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">so really don&#39;t try to grocket all them</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">all at once</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">okay the issue basically is plant the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">seed of justification</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:23.599" style="s2">you know and then just start using it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what is it and where and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.599" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">how how do i apply that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:28.319" style="s2">okay and now it&#39;s like oh okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">analytic justification where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.319" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">actually asking truth based claims</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:33.760" style="s2">there&#39;s social and personal dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">well it&#39;s a private narrator personal</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.760" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">oh okay so there&#39;s a social dynamic what</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">did i find myself wanting to say this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">well there&#39;s a social personal dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">if we&#39;re all getting together in a group</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">now we have to decide hey are we going</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:45.440" style="s2">to meet what&#39;s the identity of us oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a social dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">is there a truth claim that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">table that&#39;s an analytic</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">dynamic and then you start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">and the whole thing is like an onion and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">it layers itself so</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.839" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">what i&#39;ll say is let it grow don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">to reduce it and just</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">just be with it and you&#39;ll see it will</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">just morph</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">and move but it doesn&#39;t lose its</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:14.559" style="s2">coherence it actually just grows</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">in it at least that&#39;s my experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.559" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">could could you give me an and explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">it like i&#39;m five version of what you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:21.839" style="s2">just said i don&#39;t think i quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.839" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">and then yeah that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">five-year-old version um</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">i so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:33.280" style="s2">okay so a couple of i&#39;ll i&#39;ll do it this</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.280" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">so your propositional system is trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">to get a handle on it right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">okay all right so that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.599" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">thing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">note all right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.119" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">propositional sense making system trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s sort of both so</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">broad that it gets slippery it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">where&#39;s the tree where&#39;s the forest</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">okay so then we could just say oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">what your propositional system is doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:01.119" style="s2">all right so the other thing that i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">say is most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.119" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">your propositional system is just</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">tracking systems of justification</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">all right so mostly assuming so in</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">everyday conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">hey can hey dear can you go get me that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">glass of milk i forgot it</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">oh notice i said i forgot it which was</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">implied</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">but it then says actually i&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">responsibility i said i forgot</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">okay and now why am i saying i forgot</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">well because i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">asking you to spend money if i just said</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">hey go get the milk</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">guess what what she would have said</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">you if i&#39;m talking about my wife</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">okay he&#39;s like what the hell you go get</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">the goddamn milk right but if i say i</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">forgot it</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.359" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">then what does that do it basically says</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">i&#39;ll to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">that i was foolish i should have been</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">writing it there you&#39;ll see all the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">that you&#39;ll give disclaimers</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">okay as you give accounts you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">well hey this may come across as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">little insensitive</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">trigger warning okay what&#39;s that well</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a disclaimer gives me safe space</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">so i can then say something that could</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">potentially be offensive</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">well that&#39;s creates a justification</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">so anyway the point of visit london is</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">actually it&#39;s very it&#39;s a somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">difficult question to answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">because of its its ubiquity and depth</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">so sort of like yup it&#39;s basically let</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">don&#39;t try to reduce it to a thing just</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">let yourself recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s an ocean</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.440" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s like question answer dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">are what get you into this and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">trying to fit in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.839" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">socially but then also at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">truth and so on that then is how this</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">carries itself out is that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s good i mean so then</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:46.319" style="s2">so i i built the whole unified theory of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">knowledge around it</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.319" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">okay so that because it opened up so</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:50.319" style="s2">many damn questions that i then had to</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">resolve</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.319" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">all right that&#39;s another way so i you</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">know if i had an endless number of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">sense making things like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">things we&#39;re not talking about at all is</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">the influence matrix</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">all right in fact i just got off the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">phone with jordan hall because i was</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">jordan when you get into you and daniel</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">schmuckenberger getting into the concept</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">of influence</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">be very aware that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:11.680" style="s2">complicated concept you have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">deconstruct</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.680" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">okay like for example there&#39;s power</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">influence there&#39;s love influence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">freedom dynamic around influence most</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">importance is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">relational value and influence</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">and social influence at a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:26.799" style="s2">level especially if you start to get</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.880" style="s2">into game b dynamics because game a is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.799" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">all about instrumental social influence</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.880" end="01:03:32.640" style="s2">and really there&#39;s core relational value</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:34.559" style="s2">dynamics about aligning those</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.640" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">i know i&#39;m not maybe making a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.559" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">sense here but the bottom line is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a it&#39;s a massive amount of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">layering</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">okay and then you have to get into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">layering well that&#39;s the social dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">what are the personal versus</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">social dynamics and then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">socio-historical dynamics and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">okay so and in fact the entire unified</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">theory is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">an encapsulation around once i opened up</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">unlock the key of justification and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">was like boom you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.520" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">wow you see the water yeah all of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.839" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">sudden i saw the water</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">right and it was very deep and very</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">broad and it took me lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">like a damn garden</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:21.599" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s go to some of the questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">that are in the chat</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.680" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">well um i&#39;m just fine about my question</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">again first of all greg thanks for</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">taking time to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">explain your theory and all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">epiphanies that</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">led you to it and engines uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">you saw the water the fish saw the water</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">and i certainly don&#39;t claim to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:26.330" style="s2">understand the breadth of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">what you&#39;re presenting um</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.330" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">but a couple of questions about um well</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">first of all are you curious if you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">a theory of positive psychology or human</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">flourishing</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s good nothing um</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.880" end="01:05:46.240" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry did you you asked what about</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.880" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">positive psychology in florida</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.240" end="01:05:49.440" style="s2">do you have it does your theory do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">have a theory of positive psychology or</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.440" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">human flourishing</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:56.720" style="s2">yes i mean the uh the seventh branch</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">on the tree back there that&#39;s uh the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.720" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">nested model of well-being</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">um in fact i critique positive</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:05.359" style="s2">psychology because</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:07.119" style="s2">uh they are basically um</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.359" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">unfortunately they follow mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.119" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">academic psychology uh which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">basically an empirical discipline</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">um and as such they basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.960" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">empirically carve up</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">uh virtue in the positive domains which</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.440" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">useful uh but they if you just carve up</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">empirical constructs uh you basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">have what&#39;s called the sandcastle</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">problem meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going to build lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">super cool um idiographic</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">or research driven concepts like oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">growth mindset</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:37.680" style="s2">or oh character virtue or all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.839" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">kinds of notions or subjective</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.680" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">um the question is though how do they</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.119" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">interrelate what values do we</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">how do we put this together how do we</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">put it together with the dark side</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.640" end="01:06:51.200" style="s2">of human experience and a holistic view</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m a really big fan that</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.200" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">you know clinical and empirical</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">psychology move from the dark side into</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">the positive that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:01.039" style="s2">unfortunately martin seligman&#39;s version</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">of positive psychology</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.039" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">um is in my opinion a decent start</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:09.920" style="s2">but unbelievably shallow and not very</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">philosophically sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.920" end="01:07:14.319" style="s2">so what so what do you need to add back</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.319" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">i i mean i&#39;m with you people who do</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">psychotherapy with uh for folks who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">unhappy trauma survivors</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">etc is unbelievably important</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">um but i would say that our psychology</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s missing all these other</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">dimensions it has no normative aspect</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">uh in the way clinical psychology is</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:38.720" style="s2">practiced</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.480" style="s2">so you&#39;re so what are the dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">that you feel need to be added to</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:46.319" style="s2">seligmans say or</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">barbara fredrickson or pick them yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.319" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">yeah no it&#39;s not so much a dimension</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">it&#39;s really the way in which they are</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">put together so you create a whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">understanding so if you take is um you</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">the question fundamentally then is like</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">like so seligman tries to get to this he</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">gets to what&#39;s called perma</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:04.000" style="s2">okay and which is basically sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">domain of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.000" end="01:08:08.839" style="s2">positive emotion uh he gets into</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">relationships he gets into achievement</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.839" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">uh i can&#39;t remember all the anyway perm</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">is an acronym for the big domains that</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">he identifies</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">so if you fill these in then you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:19.440" style="s2">some more you diamond</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">which is an aristotelian notion of sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">of the ultimate good life</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">so i am what you see happens in positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">is that the field splits between the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:27.679" style="s2">empiricists that do subjective</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.679" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">at least at the well-being level versus</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">the more functionalists that do</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">um or and and philosophically</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">sophisticated they do</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">aristotelian optimal functioning um so</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">one of the things that you would then</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">one of the things that the reason i</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">built the nested model is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">understand how to put together the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">empirical</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">frames of reference with the more</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">optimal functional frames of reference</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.759" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">into a holistic model of what</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">well-being is that&#39;s coherent and</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">appreciates both the science side</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">and the value-laden side okay so</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">actually it turns out to be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">at one level in the sense that actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:07.279" style="s2">the proper model of well-being according</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">to this is that it starts with a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.279" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">first-person experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">uh uses the empirical analysis the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">for positive affective negative affect</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:17.759" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">general narrative which is general life</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.759" end="01:09:20.960" style="s2">satisfaction specific domain narrative</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">which is are you happy with your</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.960" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">relationships happy with your job happy</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2">with finances</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">then you drop that into a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">functioning</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">and organismic functioning physiology</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what a medical doctor would do</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:34.319" style="s2">then you place that individual in both</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">the material and social environment</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">and you see harmony to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:39.279" style="s2">there&#39;s harmony and to the extent or</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:41.520" style="s2">their suffering gives you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.279" end="01:09:43.040" style="s2">an illness health dimension but</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.520" end="01:09:43.359" style="s2">ultimately you have to then encapsulate</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.040" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.359" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">in the ideology and values of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">evaluator</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">okay you have to recognize that actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to make a claim about</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:53.359" style="s2">all right you have to so for example if</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.880" end="01:09:55.120" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.359" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">identify somebody let&#39;s say oh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.120" end="01:09:58.640" style="s2">really healthy physically</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">they&#39;re climbing up in their job they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.640" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">happy with their family they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:03.120" style="s2">what they can</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">and i tell you oh by the way it&#39;s 1942</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.120" end="01:10:07.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re leading auschwitz</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">okay if i tell you that as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.520" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">some other individual then</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">most people say i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:15.600" style="s2">well-being of the auschwitz leader</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">bugs me a little bit and the reason is</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.600" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">because ultimately when we start to</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:19.840" style="s2">think about well-being</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a value-laden constant so we</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.840" end="01:10:21.920" style="s2">actually want to tie it back to our</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">ethical</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.920" end="01:10:26.880" style="s2">values and worldview so so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">positive psychology is super important</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.880" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">but like the rest of psychology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">fragmented nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:34.080" style="s2">at the level of its coherence uh and it</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">needs to be woven together</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.080" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">so once we can then have a coherent</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:39.440" style="s2">model then we can actually generate</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">and provide people the wisdom that it</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">affords but in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">frame of understanding that they can</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">actually have rather than the fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.320" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">particulate frame</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">that actually both exists and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">translated by</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">great answer thank you</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">thanks for the questions great</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.480" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">andy and then after that roy greg i</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.760" end="01:11:03.520" style="s2">love justification systems theory to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:06.719" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.520" end="01:11:08.880" style="s2">the concept of the closet trump voter</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.719" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s clearly a non-coherence</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.880" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">public self the private self and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:17.199" style="s2">justification that goes on when</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:18.960" style="s2">you publicly say or say to yourself that</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.199" end="01:11:21.440" style="s2">morally abhorrent or whatever i hate the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.960" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">guy and yet you vote for him</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.440" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">question is what has changed besides</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">proliferation of media in the last</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">50 years that makes in your opinion</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">um justification systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">different now than 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:40.719" style="s2">great question that&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">question i think it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.719" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">warrants a lot of study um here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">answer um is that you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:52.320" style="s2">getting the crest</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">of modernity in the 1960s okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">and what i mean by the crest of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:56.159" style="s2">modernity i mean that you come off a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">world war</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.159" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">two um you you then especially like in</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:01.920" style="s2">the united states you then get an</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:05.199" style="s2">establishment</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.920" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">of the institutions the understanding</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">the roles and functions of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:09.920" style="s2">individuals are doing and essentially</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">the knowledge systems are</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.920" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">adequate to give people a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:17.600" style="s2">security clarity and understanding</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:18.719" style="s2">okay um so in other words basically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.600" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">up to the task</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.719" end="01:12:22.640" style="s2">now what you start to see in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:24.880" style="s2">is uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">there has been these horrible world war</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.880" end="01:12:28.080" style="s2">one world war ii</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">and and these deviations and we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.080" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">these serious concerns and with nazis</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:34.000" style="s2">and we see oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">um there is some profound problem with</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.000" end="01:12:37.679" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">and white male domination and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.679" end="01:12:41.199" style="s2">colonialism and so you see</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">social justice movements you see</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.199" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">starting to critique</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">a philosophical continental philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:48.000" style="s2">starting to critique</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:49.520" style="s2">the the depth and truth claims</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.000" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">transcendental truth claims</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.520" end="01:12:52.800" style="s2">but really in the 1960s and 70s all</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">there was a lot of social unrest</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.800" end="01:12:56.080" style="s2">obviously 68</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">things like that but ultimately people</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.080" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">are like oh yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.840" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">we have enough sense making relative to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">the information ecology relative to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">change relative to what&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">be good enough we feel like we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:07.679" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:09.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re actually sane and okay we</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.679" end="01:13:11.360" style="s2">trust the broadcasting functions and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">structures seem to be so we have faith</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.360" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">in the institutions</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">okay and then basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:20.159" style="s2">the world is hap is changing so fast at</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:21.520" style="s2">the level of technology</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.159" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">at the level of polluting the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.520" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">information ecology digital tips</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:27.679" style="s2">okay we connect we hook ourselves up</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">into an enormous number of different</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.679" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">and then we start facing more and more</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:34.719" style="s2">challenging so</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">the size of the actual complexity of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.719" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">information ecology the rapidity of</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">change that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:42.159" style="s2">the availability of different</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">communication networks okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.159" end="01:13:45.920" style="s2">essentially in a period of couple</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:47.760" style="s2">decades completely outstrips the old</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.920" end="01:13:51.040" style="s2">paradigms capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.760" end="01:13:53.840" style="s2">regulation sense-making and control okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.040" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">so that by overall then now the rules of</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.840" end="01:13:56.239" style="s2">the game</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.400" end="01:13:57.840" style="s2">and i this is the shorthand for this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">digital okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.840" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">from the vantage point of the tree of</p>

<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">knew the 21st century was going to be a</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">okay about six months after i discovered</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">six weeks because i knew</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">that we had laid down the internet we&#39;d</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:50.719" style="s2">developed artificial intelligence we</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.320" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">were building a communication system</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.719" end="01:14:54.239" style="s2">that is going to open up a set of</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:55.920" style="s2">possibilities that it was just not going</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.239" end="01:14:57.679" style="s2">to be able to be contained in the old</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.679" end="01:15:02.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s the short answer is that i</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.239" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">think that we have access to information</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:07.760" style="s2">perspective and and ways of being that</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.520" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">our knowledge systems are not</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.760" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">they&#39;re not good justification systems</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:13.679" style="s2">for it and they&#39;re not up to the task</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:16.239" style="s2">these are the things that ground our</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.679" end="01:15:17.600" style="s2">institutions so everybody&#39;s losing trust</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.239" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">in the institutions everyone&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.600" end="01:15:20.640" style="s2">around going there&#39;s something deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:23.280" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.640" end="01:15:24.960" style="s2">and unsustainable about the structure</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.280" end="01:15:27.280" style="s2">because the change factor</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.960" end="01:15:28.080" style="s2">is grossly outstripping the constraint</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.280" end="01:15:30.159" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.080" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">during all sorts of chaos hopefully that</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.159" end="01:15:34.560" style="s2">chaos will be realized into opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll find new equilibriating i talk</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.560" end="01:15:37.440" style="s2">about the fifth joint point</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:38.960" style="s2">new equilibriating structures that then</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.440" end="01:15:41.199" style="s2">allow us to get settled</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.960" end="01:15:42.960" style="s2">and then you know find a way to the 21st</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.199" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">century is a lot saner than the current</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.960" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">state of affairs</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.840" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">so it was less complex 50 years ago to</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.400" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">how how were tribes formed differently</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:22.719" style="s2">there was less complexity with knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:26.239" style="s2">but it was so monopolized</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.719" end="01:16:29.120" style="s2">that weren&#39;t you still afraid then to</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.239" end="01:16:30.880" style="s2">um yeah of course but the broadcasting</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.120" end="01:16:33.040" style="s2">function of the church is just so</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.880" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">strong it can stay for 500 years you</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.040" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">know right because in other words</p>

<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:39.600" style="s2">atheist right and you might</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:41.360" style="s2">look of course you might loathe it you</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.600" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">hate the freedom listen i&#39;m glad i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:16:53.600" end="01:16:56.640" style="s2">institutional infrastructure so</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.120" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">unbelievably tightly</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.640" end="01:17:00.400" style="s2">and the information capacities is so</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.080" end="01:17:11.600" style="s2">going to root you out and of course</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a subset of jews that they have</p>

<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">you know but basically the entire</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">so so it has massive control and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:28.480" style="s2">information technologies that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">available</p>

<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:33.760" style="s2">only narrative so how how do you get</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:36.880" style="s2">your message out</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.760" end="01:17:39.760" style="s2">how would you know right um if if</p>

<p begin="01:17:39.760" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">there&#39;s another atheist</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">obviously on the internet uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:50.320" style="s2">you all you need to do is just to do a</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:51.679" style="s2">google search and i can instantaneously</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.320" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">out of seven billion people or however</p>

<p begin="01:18:05.679" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">uh the internet i mean writing changed</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:12.000" style="s2">it dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">okay telephone changed it uh all of</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:23.040" style="s2">now that we have well the argument is</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.880" end="01:18:25.840" style="s2">that digital is changing us like</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.040" end="01:18:27.440" style="s2">no no other system it&#39;s even makes</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.840" end="01:18:28.000" style="s2">writing look like a little drop in the</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.000" end="01:18:31.600" style="s2">so digital completely transforms the</p>

<p begin="01:18:39.840" end="01:18:43.120" style="s2">is this actually going to hold together</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:47.400" style="s2">how has the</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.120" end="01:18:49.199" style="s2">um positive side of this structure</p>

<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">so let&#39;s use two examples um 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.000" end="01:19:07.280" style="s2">ago 15 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">smoking in restaurants had no momentum</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.920" end="01:20:06.960" style="s2">challenging the authority of tradition</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.080" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">has been building okay and part of it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.960" end="01:20:09.840" style="s2">made accessible</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.440" style="s2">and in many ways a good way i mean the</p>

<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">be much freer to be themselves</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.239" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">the opportunities are unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.840" end="01:20:23.520" style="s2">tremendous uh and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">is bad</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">unless we change our fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:51.679" style="s2">connecting with all the seers is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.080" end="01:20:53.120" style="s2">number of people are seeing this</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.679" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">same sub mountain from different</p>

<p begin="01:21:36.159" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">a little bit of difference and i hope it</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.600" end="01:21:42.880" style="s2">will get through peer review</p>

<p begin="01:22:34.320" end="01:22:37.760" style="s2">i i noticed an erosion of trust in that</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.800" end="01:22:42.400" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.760" end="01:22:45.920" style="s2">for four decades six years ago i began</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.400" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">the transition to alternative dispute</p>

<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:40.000" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve done a lot of marriage</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:42.960" style="s2">therapy and of course work with people</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.000" end="01:23:43.679" style="s2">managing being stuck in conflict with</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.960" end="01:23:46.800" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.679" end="01:23:49.040" style="s2">with their past with their future with</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.040" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s definitely close to my heart</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.560" end="01:23:58.159" style="s2">and finding pathways of effective</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:24:01.440" style="s2">remediation and mediation</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:04.480" style="s2">are absolutely central to</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.440" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">some of the work um i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.480" end="01:24:07.840" style="s2">point you to my homepage unified theory</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:11.120" style="s2">of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.840" end="01:24:14.719" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s got eight key ideas on it</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.120" end="01:24:16.800" style="s2">um when when people are asking me</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.719" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">you know kind of well how do i apply</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.800" end="01:24:20.639" style="s2">your system</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:22.400" style="s2">in a way that helps me especially when</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.639" end="01:24:26.000" style="s2">people are in conflict</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.400" end="01:24:29.199" style="s2">um the the thing that i try to help</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.000" end="01:24:31.440" style="s2">folks do uh or that what i offer them</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.199" end="01:24:34.880" style="s2">is a frame for an integrative approach</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.440" end="01:24:37.040" style="s2">to psychological mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.880" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">psychological mindfulness is the process</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.040" end="01:24:41.280" style="s2">by which we</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:42.239" style="s2">enter into our space and allow ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.280" end="01:24:44.719" style="s2">to become aware</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.239" end="01:24:46.639" style="s2">and attune to what is happening as</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.719" end="01:24:48.320" style="s2">opposed to mindlessness</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.639" end="01:24:49.920" style="s2">right which is when we&#39;re just defensive</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.320" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">and reacting</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.920" end="01:24:53.679" style="s2">so we want when we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:55.600" style="s2">individuals that are actually at least</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.679" end="01:24:56.480" style="s2">open then to the process by which they</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.600" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">would then</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.480" end="01:24:59.679" style="s2">find a more adaptive resolution if</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">they&#39;re in conflict</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.679" end="01:25:03.360" style="s2">we try to add us what&#39;s called the stage</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:04.960" style="s2">of change level we want to get them</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.360" end="01:25:06.719" style="s2">contemplating about ways in which they</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.960" end="01:25:10.239" style="s2">would be different</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.719" end="01:25:13.120" style="s2">okay um and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.239" end="01:25:14.880" style="s2">invite them to uh be open to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.120" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.880" end="01:25:20.320" style="s2">of that difference um and then if you if</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:22.080" style="s2">you get that and you get some commitment</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.320" end="01:25:24.239" style="s2">to that then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.080" end="01:25:26.880" style="s2">how how how would you then cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.239" end="01:25:28.719" style="s2">that attitude</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.880" end="01:25:30.080" style="s2">and generally what you want to try to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.719" end="01:25:31.679" style="s2">is you want to foster levels of</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.080" end="01:25:34.800" style="s2">awareness acceptance and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.679" end="01:25:36.400" style="s2">change in various parties okay and</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.800" end="01:25:38.880" style="s2">realize the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.400" end="01:25:40.400" style="s2">sort of ego commitments to maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.880" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">patterns uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.400" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">versus openness to potential adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2">valued pathways</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:47.840" style="s2">how do you do that well the shorthand of</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.320" end="01:25:51.679" style="s2">what i offer is one thing called</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.840" end="01:25:53.679" style="s2">calm okay which is which is an acronym</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.679" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">first it&#39;s like hey let&#39;s get calm let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.679" end="01:25:57.520" style="s2">recognize that when we get pissed off</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">we drop into defensive mindsets it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.520" end="01:26:02.239" style="s2">either attack we freeze or flight</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:03.679" style="s2">or we fawn and apologize and then we</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.239" end="01:26:06.880" style="s2">present it later these are</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.679" end="01:26:08.639" style="s2">classic stances in common and we want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.880" end="01:26:09.920" style="s2">basically we want to acknowledge those</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.639" end="01:26:11.679" style="s2">and we understand where they come from</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.920" end="01:26:13.040" style="s2">our body and our emotion</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.679" end="01:26:14.719" style="s2">we also realize that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.040" end="01:26:16.880" style="s2">short-term emotional responses that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.719" end="01:26:18.560" style="s2">very valuable and oriented us but rarely</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.880" end="01:26:20.159" style="s2">valuable in the impulses that they</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.560" end="01:26:22.639" style="s2">orient us towards</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.159" end="01:26:24.159" style="s2">okay at least in the short term so we</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.639" end="01:26:26.639" style="s2">then want to listen to them and listen</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.159" end="01:26:29.120" style="s2">to their appraisal listen to your heart</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.639" end="01:26:30.239" style="s2">and then open up an attitude both</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:33.440" style="s2">intra-psychically</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.239" end="01:26:34.880" style="s2">and interpersonally that fosters</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.440" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.880" end="01:26:39.199" style="s2">okay so curiosity yes i see somebody</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">talking about restorative justice here</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.199" end="01:26:42.560" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful too</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:43.760" style="s2">um that&#39;s a nice helpful uh way of</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.760" end="01:26:46.960" style="s2">different there are lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.719" end="01:26:47.600" style="s2">ways to peace and and connection but</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.960" end="01:26:49.760" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.600" end="01:26:51.760" style="s2">curiosity first orients individuals to a</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.760" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">more mindful state that then</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.760" end="01:26:55.840" style="s2">adopts a position where you can be</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:57.440" style="s2">wondering about oneself and one&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.840" end="01:27:00.159" style="s2">where does this come from what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.440" end="01:27:01.679" style="s2">going on what is the what&#39;s the salient</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.159" end="01:27:03.679" style="s2">issue and what&#39;s the deeper issues</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.679" end="01:27:05.199" style="s2">perhaps then there&#39;s issues of</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.679" end="01:27:06.880" style="s2">acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.199" end="01:27:08.639" style="s2">this is a capacity to recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.880" end="01:27:09.280" style="s2">actually yeah life sucks sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.639" end="01:27:11.040" style="s2">get hurt</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.280" end="01:27:13.199" style="s2">how can you sit with what is with</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.040" end="01:27:17.600" style="s2">distress tolerance with clarity</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.199" end="01:27:20.080" style="s2">okay then l stands for loving compassion</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.600" end="01:27:21.520" style="s2">that&#39;s an attitude of just basic dignity</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.080" end="01:27:23.600" style="s2">towards others and that you hope</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.520" end="01:27:26.719" style="s2">that they aren&#39;t suffering this is again</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.600" end="01:27:29.920" style="s2">identity to itself another</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.719" end="01:27:31.920" style="s2">and then m refers to</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.920" end="01:27:34.159" style="s2">a motivated toward valued states of</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.920" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">being in the short and long term</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.159" end="01:27:39.600" style="s2">so if i&#39;m in negotiation what is the uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:40.960" style="s2">what is the moment what do i hope in</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.600" end="01:27:41.920" style="s2">relationship to the end of this</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.920" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">and what is my long-term view ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:46.000" style="s2">all the way up to what might be called</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.440" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2">eulogy</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.000" end="01:27:50.000" style="s2">values which is what kind of person do i</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.000" end="01:27:51.600" style="s2">want to be and what kind of ancestor do</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.000" end="01:27:53.440" style="s2">i want to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.600" end="01:27:54.639" style="s2">so that then places it on the context of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.440" end="01:27:56.719" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.639" end="01:27:59.199" style="s2">so what that basically is is that tries</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.719" end="01:28:00.880" style="s2">to create the kind of arena</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.199" end="01:28:02.560" style="s2">that enables individuals to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.880" end="01:28:04.159" style="s2">come together who have been wounded</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.560" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">who&#39;ve been traumatized or bitter with</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.159" end="01:28:09.199" style="s2">each other who have real disputes</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:10.159" style="s2">but at least it soothes and orients</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.199" end="01:28:12.480" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.159" end="01:28:14.239" style="s2">adaptive outcomes and it identifies the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.480" end="01:28:16.159" style="s2">underlying emotional triggers</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.239" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">and how to hold them how to honor them</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.159" end="01:28:20.560" style="s2">but also not how</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">uh to be held a hijacked limbic hijack</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.560" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">people say about your relationship</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.960" end="01:28:28.719" style="s2">greg it&#39;s 3 30 now would you have any</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.840" end="01:28:30.080" style="s2">time afterwards</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.320" end="01:29:12.320" style="s2">and the summary is well disagreement is</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.560" end="01:29:13.280" style="s2">often treated as a problem weinberg</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.320" end="01:29:15.280" style="s2">thinks there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.280" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">overlooked upsides to it you&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.280" end="01:29:19.120" style="s2">about the value of disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.040" end="01:29:20.480" style="s2">obstacles to disagreeing well and how we</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.120" end="01:29:22.560" style="s2">might better get along with those whom</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.480" end="01:29:24.880" style="s2">we disagree</p>

<p begin="01:29:36.960" end="01:29:40.239" style="s2">um you know i guess the closing thought</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.600" end="01:29:41.440" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.239" end="01:29:43.440" style="s2">learning how to observe your</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.440" end="01:29:44.719" style="s2">justification systems realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.440" end="01:29:46.639" style="s2">they&#39;re not reality</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.719" end="01:29:48.960" style="s2">they are very important aspect of who we</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.639" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">are uh but being able to shift</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.960" end="01:29:52.480" style="s2">your perspective on them see them in</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:54.480" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.480" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">recognize the dynamics that&#39;s a i</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.480" end="01:29:59.360" style="s2">believe that&#39;s a very valuable thing so</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:29:59.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m happy to share</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.800" end="01:30:04.000" style="s2">um and next week um is there a theme to</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:06.000" style="s2">the session</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.000" end="01:30:07.600" style="s2">yeah so next week we will kind of come</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.000" end="01:30:09.679" style="s2">in with a slightly different angle we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.600" end="01:30:12.320" style="s2">talk about the problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.679" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">uh we&#39;ll need to understand what that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.320" end="01:30:15.280" style="s2">from my vantage point</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">uh then what we&#39;ll do is we get to open</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.280" end="01:30:18.159" style="s2">up and do a conversation with a special</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.440" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">guest</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.159" end="01:30:22.239" style="s2">uh zack stein uh who talked about his</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:23.760" style="s2">own metapsychology</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.239" end="01:30:25.920" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll have some iterative</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.760" end="01:30:27.840" style="s2">dialogue between his version and</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.920" end="01:30:30.320" style="s2">experience of the field of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.840" end="01:30:31.360" style="s2">why it led him to his view uh what my</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.320" end="01:30:33.040" style="s2">view is and</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.360" end="01:30:34.719" style="s2">you know how to see them complementary</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:36.080" style="s2">somebody asked questions about how those</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.719" end="01:30:36.480" style="s2">two things were late i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.080" end="01:30:38.239" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.480" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">but somebody did and it led to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.239" end="01:30:42.239" style="s2">good discussion</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:44.719" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be really exciting um</p>
