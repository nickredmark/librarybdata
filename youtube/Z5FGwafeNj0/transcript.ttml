<p begin="00:00:00.680" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">so less than a year ago i diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.259" end="00:00:13.259" style="s2">myself with autism in spring 2019 and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">this is that story and a bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">magic that makes me autistic so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">years before that you know I&#39;d say 2017</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">I got undiagnosed with a DD by my doctor</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">at the time who said I wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">get the meds unless I was read I ignored</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">as an adult so I went through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">process which is weird because I felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">like she had taken away a piece of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">identity I didn&#39;t really care to us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">start about the meds it was like you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:39.480" style="s2">can&#39;t be autistic</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t be a DD unless you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">are characterized as I I knew my whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:47.430" style="s2">life I was a DD it&#39;s my brain that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">lived in and dealt with my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.430" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">and so in getting read iagnosed or they</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">DD which did end up happening I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">mistakenly taking a questionnaire on</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">autism and without knowing that it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.230" style="s2">very clear I was whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:03.059" style="s2">questionnaire was was telling me I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.230" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">and then at the top was like oh it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.059" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">tests that&#39;s why it&#39;s not the same that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">there was just qualities that I did not</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">associate with a DD and so in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:19.310" style="s2">it gave me the inkling the like little</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">spark of like maybe you&#39;re autistic the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.310" end="00:01:22.729" style="s2">straw that broke the camel&#39;s back the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">thing that they pushed it over the edge</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.729" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">was somebody who tweeted out a list of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re autistic if and there were</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">so much it just resonated with me on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">this deep-down level that I was in tears</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">and I was like these are my people</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">these this is what I&#39;ve been dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">with my whole life it&#39;s not just a DD</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">and it&#39;s also not just my brain changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.850" style="s2">what would be known as brain damage from</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">my my brain tumors and resulting</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.850" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">treatments it is something that now</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">looking back I can see my whole life my</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">sensory issues when I was a child my</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">being overly emotional as a child</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">needing to turn it off being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">feel other people&#39;s emotions which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">more of an empath thing but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:13.519" style="s2">autistic people also have</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:14.719" style="s2">part of it it&#39;s like feeling other</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.519" end="00:02:16.280" style="s2">people&#39;s emotions and not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.719" end="00:02:18.499" style="s2">make sense of them not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.280" end="00:02:22.069" style="s2">name your own emotions feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.499" end="00:02:23.659" style="s2">clothes if if clothes were itchy or</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.069" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">scratchy they were never worn again I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.659" end="00:02:27.439" style="s2">didn&#39;t care how much money I spent on</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:31.000" style="s2">them if shoes gave me a blister one time</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.439" end="00:02:33.349" style="s2">they were never getting worn again and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.000" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">now that I can embrace that and not feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.349" end="00:02:38.719" style="s2">like I&#39;m a broken female because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.900" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">into fashion like right Comfort comfort</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.719" end="00:02:43.099" style="s2">always Trump&#39;s fashion for me it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">always is not for my kid though she</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.099" end="00:02:46.269" style="s2">still needs it to be comfortable she</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:51.829" style="s2">also wants it to be beautiful and cute I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.269" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">don&#39;t my sensory stuff did get worse</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.829" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">after my brain tumors but I always had</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:02:58.699" style="s2">it I remember wanting to like stab my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:01.010" style="s2">brother with a fork when he would chew</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.699" end="00:03:03.379" style="s2">with his mouth open at breakfast and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.010" end="00:03:05.870" style="s2">was not I was like a very happy bubbly</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.379" end="00:03:08.569" style="s2">child but the sensory stuff would make</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.870" end="00:03:10.430" style="s2">me go off I would have a tantrum well</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.569" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">into my teenage years if I had to wash</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.430" end="00:03:15.709" style="s2">the dishes and there was peanut butter</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:17.329" style="s2">in it I didn&#39;t know how to verbally</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:19.639" style="s2">communicate that it was just like well</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.329" end="00:03:21.199" style="s2">you&#39;re being a baby like so up it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.639" end="00:03:24.829" style="s2">a big deal everyone else is doing it you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.199" end="00:03:27.259" style="s2">just don&#39;t you just don&#39;t want to I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.829" end="00:03:29.509" style="s2">look back now with hindsight and see how</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.259" end="00:03:33.729" style="s2">my special I&#39;ve had special interests</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.509" end="00:03:36.459" style="s2">come and go for my life but two of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.729" end="00:03:40.849" style="s2">two of mine that I&#39;ve had my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.459" end="00:03:42.620" style="s2">that are also they&#39;re both more socially</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.849" end="00:03:45.229" style="s2">acceptable than a lot of what other</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.620" end="00:03:49.849" style="s2">people special interests are but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.229" end="00:03:51.949" style="s2">had this urge to learn about human</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.849" end="00:03:53.750" style="s2">atrocity the things that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.949" end="00:03:55.939" style="s2">done to each other throughout history as</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.750" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">well as the beauty the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.939" end="00:04:02.359" style="s2">catastrophes the the animals suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:04.459" style="s2">the the genocides and Wars and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.359" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">less socially acceptable to bring up but</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.459" end="00:04:08.060" style="s2">it because it&#39;s intertwined with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:09.469" style="s2">everything else it is somewhat socially</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.060" end="00:04:10.909" style="s2">acceptable I&#39;m more socially acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.469" end="00:04:13.069" style="s2">now well you still should be probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.909" end="00:04:15.889" style="s2">breakups you know these these type of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.069" end="00:04:18.380" style="s2">things that bring the mood down in and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.889" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">one of my masks is laughing all the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.380" end="00:04:21.139" style="s2">and I don&#39;t even know how to not do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">one that one I don&#39;t know how to unmask</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.139" end="00:04:24.480" style="s2">and maybe I will at some point in time</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:26.760" style="s2">in their moments when I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.480" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">but I think it helps me learn about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.760" end="00:04:31.140" style="s2">atrocities because it has an actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:33.480" style="s2">neurological effect on my body to be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.140" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">a happy mood almost all of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.480" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">so I was able to learn about these</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.420" style="s2">things that depress other people and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">underlining I think that&#39;s where a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.420" end="00:04:42.890" style="s2">of my chronic health issues come from is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">knowing about all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.890" end="00:04:48.060" style="s2">feeling alone in that knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:49.170" style="s2">like people just don&#39;t want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.060" end="00:04:51.630" style="s2">about it they don&#39;t want to know they</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.170" end="00:04:54.150" style="s2">don&#39;t want to solve it and I get why</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.630" end="00:04:56.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s overwhelming and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.150" end="00:04:57.960" style="s2">other special interest is me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.640" end="00:04:59.910" style="s2">Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.960" end="00:05:01.260" style="s2">how do I fit into the world and through</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.910" end="00:05:02.730" style="s2">that how do other people fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:04.890" style="s2">world how does how do things work for</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.730" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">other people what makes me unique and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.890" end="00:05:08.460" style="s2">different and what makes me the same and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">now that it&#39;s coming more from a place</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.460" end="00:05:14.910" style="s2">of curiosity rather than I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">feeling broken because I was different</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.910" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">in some way there is a power there and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">every time I&#39;ve learned about new traits</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">that autistic people have well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:26.250" style="s2">not new traits but they&#39;re new to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.020" end="00:05:27.620" style="s2">oppositional defiance disorder which i</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.250" end="00:05:29.730" style="s2">think is maybe called something else now</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.620" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">but I&#39;m like yeah right and someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:31.890" style="s2">tells me to do something I wanted you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:33.750" style="s2">the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.890" end="00:05:35.880" style="s2">I cannot own that and be like no listen</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.750" end="00:05:36.930" style="s2">to your own internal guide don&#39;t not do</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.880" end="00:05:38.280" style="s2">something because someone tells you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.930" end="00:05:41.370" style="s2">but also don&#39;t do something cuz somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.280" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">tells you to that more and more autistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.370" end="00:05:46.530" style="s2">people there&#39;s a higher per capita</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:50.820" style="s2">percent of people who are queer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.530" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">asexual in the autistic community and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.820" end="00:05:56.340" style="s2">those are things that I definitely am so</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:57.570" style="s2">I am gonna end this here cuz I really</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.340" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">need to cough and I don&#39;t want a call</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.570" end="00:06:02.040" style="s2">from camera and we&#39;re at the 6 minute</p>
