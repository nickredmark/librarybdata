<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:19.340" style="s2">aren&#39;t on really so to speak there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">there imperative to actually maintain</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.340" end="00:01:23.909" style="s2">dialogue with someone else you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">of stop it&#39;s like oh I misspoke or</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.909" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">something you&#39;re not you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">committed it&#39;s like yeah yeah you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">you&#39;re not truly committed to the dance</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">and so I begin something and start</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">talking I&#39;d be like you idiot</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:39.170" style="s2">click that again there we go it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:39.170" style="s2">I&#39;m back it&#39;s like good evening everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.409" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">Reba god that&#39;s tiring find a way to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">out of that trap but it&#39;s like and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">I was thinking to myself don&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">what in you is able to actually commit</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">to this right now so that because that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">is I suppose one technical definition of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">wigging yourself out and you smoke too</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">much weed</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m stuck in it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">loop here that I can&#39;t quite get out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:13.190" style="s2">and just move forward and there we go</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">loops</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.190" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">you know perhaps this is an experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve both shared on LSD for example or</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">in a psychedelic where you are trapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">in some sort of loop yes I wonder if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">could throw if I could throw something</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:31.290" style="s2">at you here because this actually may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">something we can articulate with some it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">might be helpful to some people watching</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">this and I want to be careful about any</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.270" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">sort of conversation to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">psychedelics and flippin advocacy</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:46.050" style="s2">because it&#39;s absolutely not the thing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">be flippant about no but these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.050" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">powerful tools that can be used for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">great positive benefit god there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">many there&#39;s so many disclaimers I even</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:58.739" style="s2">want to add to that statement one thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:00.600" style="s2">though that is experienced as a negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.739" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">experience for people is when when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.600" end="00:03:04.260" style="s2">are trapped in some sort of thought loop</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.260" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">that seems the idea of that loop i seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">resonant to a lot of the stuff we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:16.610" style="s2">been speaking about earlier so I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">if you could articulate what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.610" end="00:03:21.330" style="s2">stuck in a loop more broadly and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:23.549" style="s2">perhaps how that shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.330" end="00:03:27.530" style="s2">psychedelics and then what can be done</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.549" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">to alleviate or move through that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.530" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">torture well yeah I&#39;ve certainly been in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">a few psychedelic loops that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">mm-hmm and they have perhaps been the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:53.959" style="s2">most fruitful events when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:57.739" style="s2">navigating the mental loops that say</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.959" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">might come up in a sober mental</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.739" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">perspective it seems like those loops</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:12.290" style="s2">exposed the fractal nature of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">trying to wrap itself around reality and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.290" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">never quite being able to as reality is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">propelled by novelty and so it is always</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:23.139" style="s2">expanding and so the moment we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:25.419" style="s2">map you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.139" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">talked about before that that map never</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.419" end="00:04:35.139" style="s2">quite fits reality because again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">in a new more novel space again and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.139" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">does seem to be part of the teaching</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.870" end="00:04:45.219" style="s2">with the psychedelic Bardot&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">actually for sure because Saito&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.219" end="00:04:54.189" style="s2">you just just dimensions that you seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:55.810" style="s2">to approach they&#39;re always like Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.189" end="00:04:58.419" style="s2">Leary around us for a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.810" end="00:05:02.439" style="s2">book the psychedelic experience which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.419" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">based on Bardot&#39;s kind of these levels</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.439" end="00:05:13.020" style="s2">or you could say tests of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">through the psychedelics whereby you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.020" end="00:05:18.520" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re tested almost by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.810" end="00:05:21.789" style="s2">experience to see kind of where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.520" end="00:05:27.069" style="s2">at and they use the Tibetan Book of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.789" end="00:05:29.589" style="s2">Dead to to kind of formulate these quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.069" end="00:05:32.650" style="s2">poetic verses that you could use to help</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.589" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">someone through one of those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.650" end="00:05:36.550" style="s2">you could read it yourself or someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:40.089" style="s2">would read it out to someone else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.550" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">having a heavy time in the trip but</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.089" end="00:05:50.289" style="s2">aside from that it always seemed as if</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:51.849" style="s2">any suffering I was experiencing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.289" end="00:05:56.050" style="s2">within a psyche</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.849" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">psychedelic trip was some notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.050" end="00:06:06.159" style="s2">grasping some notion of mental</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">attachment and to the degree that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.159" end="00:06:18.009" style="s2">didn&#39;t attach the psychedelics seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">accelerate that loop and also as they</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.009" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">accelerate it other reference points</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">seem to drop off so there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:34.779" style="s2">conceptual dropping off of of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.259" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">things that you can grasp too so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.779" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">your mind is kind of forced and back</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:46.210" style="s2">into a corner and one example of that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">would say is with LSD I had what what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.210" end="00:06:51.010" style="s2">happened was language fell away and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:54.580" style="s2">numerology was the only thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.010" end="00:06:56.500" style="s2">left just numbers and eventually went</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.580" end="00:06:58.900" style="s2">all the way down to just three to one</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.500" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">nothing one experience where for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.900" end="00:07:07.690" style="s2">probably an hour the only thing that my</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">ego was able to attach to was discerning</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.690" end="00:07:13.570" style="s2">the differences between the Trinity then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:14.470" style="s2">duality and then there not being</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.570" end="00:07:17.560" style="s2">anything anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.470" end="00:07:19.600" style="s2">and it would continuously go out and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.560" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">try to split that and the way this</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.600" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">manifests there was a friend my friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:29.800" style="s2">who was tripping with me and my cat</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:32.050" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.800" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">which entered the room and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.050" end="00:07:37.000" style="s2">figure out if there was three</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">individuals mm-hmm or if no the cat</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.000" end="00:07:41.380" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really involved in the experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.740" end="00:07:44.200" style="s2">and it was just me and my friend to ghen</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.380" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">right so just to again yeah but then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.200" end="00:07:50.110" style="s2">felt like I was seeing from Tegan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:07:52.630" style="s2">perspective myself right and that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.110" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">there was actually only one being yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.630" end="00:07:59.500" style="s2">and that seemed to loop around for</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.500" end="00:08:03.250" style="s2">involved yet a sermon or just all</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.020" end="00:08:05.410" style="s2">there&#39;s three of us and there&#39;s two of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.250" end="00:08:08.170" style="s2">us and there&#39;s one and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.410" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">and it just kept looping and looping it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.170" end="00:08:14.890" style="s2">was yeah there was pretty it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:19.000" style="s2">difficult very difficult wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.890" end="00:08:20.290" style="s2">necessary suffering but I&#39;ve to shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.000" end="00:08:22.870" style="s2">away from my own personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.290" end="00:08:24.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard that mirrored in many others</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.870" end="00:08:27.250" style="s2">too right well there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.220" end="00:08:29.920" style="s2">self-referential loop right that seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.250" end="00:08:32.380" style="s2">to drop down to something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.920" end="00:08:34.990" style="s2">simplistic that they can&#39;t escape right</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.380" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">so all other reference points of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.990" end="00:08:40.079" style="s2">seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:42.610" style="s2">fallen apart and now it&#39;s just been this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.079" end="00:08:45.189" style="s2">dance between two things that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.610" end="00:08:47.740" style="s2">get out of yes and so the only way out</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.189" end="00:08:49.769" style="s2">of it the only way out of it is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.740" end="00:08:54.009" style="s2">through again the surrender of mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.769" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">sandrov mental grasping so that you just</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.009" end="00:08:59.589" style="s2">allow reality again to be as it is and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:03.959" style="s2">could give you countless other examples</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.589" end="00:09:09.399" style="s2">of that whereby the solution has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.959" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">surrender and I suppose that often</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.399" end="00:09:14.740" style="s2">conjures up a vibe of apathy within</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:17.980" style="s2">others to just surrender and let it go</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.740" end="00:09:20.649" style="s2">but it it seems to be the real act of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:22.300" style="s2">courage to just say do you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.649" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.300" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">and when you allow that not knowing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">come paradoxically it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:34.269" style="s2">rewarded with more than you could have</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">ever imagined</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.269" end="00:09:44.889" style="s2">and often yeah that is it that does seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">to be some kind of dissolving away of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.889" end="00:09:52.149" style="s2">conditioning that you&#39;ve had from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">past or or some limiting belief all</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.149" end="00:09:56.319" style="s2">right around your identity which</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:10:00.850" style="s2">actually dissolves with that experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.319" end="00:10:02.769" style="s2">mm-hmm so I can accepting of the loop in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.850" end="00:10:07.199" style="s2">some sense isn&#39;t heart accepting a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.769" end="00:10:10.149" style="s2">decent synonym there for surrender</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.199" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">yeah I would say so is an accepting of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.149" end="00:10:19.379" style="s2">reality mm-hmm it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:19.379" style="s2">give up trying to add anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.339" end="00:10:27.810" style="s2">do you give up the need for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.320" end="00:10:30.990" style="s2">another way mm-hmm is that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.810" end="00:10:34.860" style="s2">mm-hmm a good way to absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.990" end="00:10:38.250" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.860" end="00:10:43.579" style="s2">the times we&#39;re unhappy because because</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.250" end="00:10:46.769" style="s2">we want things to be different mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.579" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a real liberation to wanting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.769" end="00:10:50.180" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:53.730" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.180" end="00:10:56.910" style="s2">so accepting what&#39;s happening and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.730" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">what you mean by that though accepting</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.910" end="00:11:07.800" style="s2">it is in some sense a valuing of it for</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:10.140" style="s2">itself just as it is and the wanting</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.800" end="00:11:13.740" style="s2">would be well we want to be in touch</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.140" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">with what is the process of moving all</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.740" end="00:11:19.079" style="s2">of that so that is that uh-huh yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.690" style="s2">sure because what&#39;s happening here in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.079" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">the psychedelic experience and not even</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.690" end="00:11:27.510" style="s2">necessary just psyche - I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:29.880" style="s2">this really happens a lot in in yoga a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.510" end="00:11:36.300" style="s2">lot actually you&#39;re building fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.880" end="00:11:38.579" style="s2">body you&#39;re giving space through these</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.300" end="00:11:43.010" style="s2">asanas freeze postural movements you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.579" end="00:11:45.990" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing you&#39;re allowing certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.010" end="00:11:47.970" style="s2">thoughts and habits and conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.990" end="00:11:50.850" style="s2">thinking to arise you&#39;re witnessing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.970" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">with presence and it&#39;s strange actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.850" end="00:11:56.190" style="s2">some postures seem to to be more</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.170" style="s2">provocative in that sense than others</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.190" end="00:11:59.310" style="s2">and you&#39;re giving space to that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.170" end="00:12:01.290" style="s2">you&#39;re watching them come up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.310" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">very similar to a psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.290" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">and then that kind of shavasana where</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:10.260" style="s2">they lie in the corpse pose at the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">is actually like an integration process</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.260" end="00:12:15.510" style="s2">it&#39;s after all these movements you then</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:18.690" style="s2">steal the body and just allow what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.510" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">happened to just settle a little like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.690" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2">muddied lake all muddied river has kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:26.550" style="s2">of bent world up and at the end you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">kind of let it sit and let things be as</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.550" end="00:12:31.199" style="s2">they are but certainly something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:33.060" style="s2">worth pointing out is that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.199" end="00:12:36.120" style="s2">why you&#39;re accepting and letting</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.060" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">is actually because the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.120" end="00:12:42.150" style="s2">you&#39;re holding on to don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">their illusions they don&#39;t a lot the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.150" end="00:12:47.220" style="s2">time they&#39;re the things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:53.430" style="s2">actually there their mind made you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:56.040" style="s2">whether that&#39;s like a again some some</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.430" end="00:13:00.120" style="s2">conditioning around the way that your</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.040" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">navigator ality that is based on an</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.120" end="00:13:06.830" style="s2">experience you have when you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:09.840" style="s2">younger that that doesn&#39;t have any any</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.830" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">value actually to your present</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.840" end="00:13:16.440" style="s2">experience right it happened but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any value now and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.440" end="00:13:22.470" style="s2">holding on to it is is giving it fuel</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.620" end="00:13:24.270" style="s2">and that and then by letting go of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.470" end="00:13:26.220" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of throwing it into the fire</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.270" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">in some ways we&#39;re not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.220" end="00:13:33.330" style="s2">negating it we&#39;re allowing it to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:42.060" style="s2">mm-hmm beautiful yes I agree with you I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.330" end="00:13:47.400" style="s2">think that the the accepting of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.060" end="00:13:49.050" style="s2">delusion is an important seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.400" end="00:13:55.560" style="s2">right now an interesting turn of phrase</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.050" end="00:14:01.230" style="s2">I find Wilbur&#39;s thought immense in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.560" end="00:14:03.420" style="s2">particular the the synthesis of so much</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.230" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">process to the terms to the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.420" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">transcend and include mm-hmm the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:20.910" style="s2">in which you awaken enable activate grow</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">into a more in touch perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.910" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">that in so doing you aren&#39;t as you put</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.930" end="00:14:37.860" style="s2">it negating mm-hmm in entirety the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.010" end="00:14:40.620" style="s2">the value released the lineage of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">one of the experiences I&#39;ve taken from</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.430" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">navigating psychedelics in particular a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:15:04.250" style="s2">navigation towards greater intensity or</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">depth associated perhaps with what</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.250" end="00:15:10.040" style="s2">people refer to as breaking through</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:12.500" style="s2">which i think is relative anyway because</p>
