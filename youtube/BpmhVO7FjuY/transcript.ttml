<p begin="00:00:11.080" end="00:00:18.460" style="s2">podcast livestream Q&amp;A section we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.400" end="00:00:20.890" style="s2">here staring down the barrel of martial</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.460" end="00:00:23.980" style="s2">law ready to answer your super chat</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.890" end="00:00:27.069" style="s2">questions so without further ado shall</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.980" end="00:00:30.189" style="s2">we get to it let&#39;s do it all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.069" end="00:00:31.630" style="s2">our friend Holly math nerd asks my dear</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.189" end="00:00:33.580" style="s2">friend in Michigan which is a swing</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.630" end="00:00:35.710" style="s2">state is a classical liberal and has a</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.580" end="00:00:38.710" style="s2">dilemma she rightly sees Trump as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.710" end="00:00:40.630" style="s2">psycho and DNC as corrupt with neither</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.710" end="00:00:43.480" style="s2">candidate fit for office who does game</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.630" end="00:00:45.400" style="s2">theory suggest she vote for it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.480" end="00:00:47.770" style="s2">good question yeah but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.400" end="00:00:50.710" style="s2">answer is obvious frankly Wow yep</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.770" end="00:00:52.120" style="s2">it&#39;s yang McRaven or McRaven yang I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.710" end="00:00:54.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know which one it&#39;s gonna be but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.120" end="00:00:56.829" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely that ticket because you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.460" end="00:01:01.510" style="s2">know what there&#39;s one thing we have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.829" end="00:01:03.040" style="s2">do we have to defeat Trump Biden in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.510" end="00:01:04.059" style="s2">we have to defeat Trump Biden there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.040" end="00:01:08.020" style="s2">question about it we should have</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.059" end="00:01:10.329" style="s2">defeated Trump Clinton in 2016 this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.020" end="00:01:14.289" style="s2">we have to defeat Trump Biden so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.329" end="00:01:18.280" style="s2">does an individual do well honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.289" end="00:01:20.740" style="s2">think it is up to those of us who have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.280" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">certain amount of reach in the world to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.740" end="00:01:28.210" style="s2">derail this runaway train before it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:29.350" style="s2">reaches the station that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.210" end="00:01:31.929" style="s2">go barreling through or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:35.229" style="s2">proper way to end that analogy is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.929" end="00:01:38.319" style="s2">will derail not simply leave one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.229" end="00:01:39.340" style="s2">two presumptive next presidents in power</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.319" end="00:01:42.700" style="s2">no I&#39;m dead serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.340" end="00:01:44.409" style="s2">I think the announcement by our two</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:46.630" style="s2">major parties that they are not serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.409" end="00:01:51.670" style="s2">about leading in an era where we face</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.630" end="00:01:55.959" style="s2">things as scary as SARS Cove 2 and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.670" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">breakdown of law and order over there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.959" end="00:02:01.599" style="s2">just no question this has to end we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">cannot play the the duallies game</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.599" end="00:02:06.420" style="s2">anymore it has to end</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:08.880" style="s2">I guess my point would be look the only</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">reason we didn&#39;t end it before everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.880" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">knows it&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">the only reason we didn&#39;t end it before</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:15.660" style="s2">is because it would be impossible to end</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:18.390" style="s2">it but impossible things are now</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.660" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">happening every day so this is the era</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.390" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">of the impossible it is time that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">challenge this dynamic because we ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">gonna survive if we let it run its</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">course all right I&#39;ll let the dog finish</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">up your thought for you it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">wonder if you can get her to be quiet</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:42.989" style="s2">thank you sweetie okay Heather and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">thank you the major media appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.989" end="00:02:47.610" style="s2">ignoring an Tifa there is so this is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.190" style="s2">underreported that convincing people of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">its veracity is almost impossible advice</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.190" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">also is Benjamin Boyce a trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">journalist it seemed that second thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">seems a little bit of a non sequitur</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.650" style="s2">although he&#39;s obviously spoken somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">to anti yeah yeah Benjamin Boyce is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.650" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">a top-notch guy and a trustworthy human</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:08.880" style="s2">being I don&#39;t know the he&#39;d call himself</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">a journalist I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.880" end="00:03:12.570" style="s2">journalist means in this era given what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">has happened to journalists but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.570" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">certainly trust Benjamin I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t trust anybody&#39;s judgement</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">completely but I trust his integrity</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">yeah no I would absolutely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">that I&#39;m not sure I would have I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have thought to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">journalist to describe him and if he</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">does then I should rethink that because</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">I trust him to choose his his titles</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:37.260" style="s2">carefully but certainly the work that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:40.829" style="s2">has done that I&#39;m most familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.260" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">which is on Evergreen has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.829" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">extraordinary and detailed and both</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:46.890" style="s2">accurate and precise yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">with respect to the first part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.890" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">question the problem with the aunty Fay</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">issue is a unless you&#39;ve tangled with</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">them directly you don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">what it is and also the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">they&#39;ve labeled themselves in the style</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:03.209" style="s2">of the Patriot Act it&#39;s hard to attack</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">the Patriot Act because you don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.209" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">like a patriot it&#39;s hard to attack and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:09.870" style="s2">Tifa because it sounds like you might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">favoring fascism now of course neither</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.870" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">of those things are true but there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">many examples of this we should we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">should devote more time at some point to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">things that come with these labels like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:28.139" style="s2">pro-life and sex positive as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:30.930" style="s2">yeah what I would say is I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.139" end="00:04:33.780" style="s2">well worth having people consider the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.930" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">game theory in other words and I tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.780" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">about this today and I thought I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.470" style="s2">I got it which was if you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">all of these people you&#39;re looking down</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.470" end="00:04:43.530" style="s2">on this protest and they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">figure out how to negotiate with each</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.530" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">other and you know anybody in the group</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">can sabotage it anybody who prefers</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">violence can sabotage it by setting off</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">a firecracker or throwing something at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:05:00.270" style="s2">any moment you can&#39;t get anywhere and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">once you&#39;ve talked to the anarchists and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">you know that they don&#39;t want peace</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:07.320" style="s2">because they don&#39;t believe you could fix</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:09.060" style="s2">the system and then you understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.320" end="00:05:10.650" style="s2">they are interspersed in these crowds</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.060" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">that they&#39;re spray paint even if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:13.950" style="s2">crowd doesn&#39;t believe that all cops are</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">bastards the fact that all the walls</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.950" end="00:05:18.389" style="s2">seem to reflect the fact that the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">I think all cops are bastards that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.389" end="00:05:24.360" style="s2">be positive so anyway if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">journalist that you know sit them down</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.360" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">and have them think this through the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">disproportionate influence of the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">anarchists is going to make peace</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:37.169" style="s2">impossible and what happens when peace</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">is impossible well we saw over the 15</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.169" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">minute break after our initial part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:45.030" style="s2">this live stream that we have a massive</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">military force being deployed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.030" end="00:05:51.180" style="s2">they&#39;ve been issued bayonets</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:53.340" style="s2">so that&#39;s where we are bayonets yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.180" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">let&#39;s not let the anti if I push us into</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">bayonets let&#39;s say one does not want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.140" end="00:06:05.880" style="s2">be pushed into bayonets I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:09.390" style="s2">what this next question means so much or</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:10.950" style="s2">it&#39;s complete isn&#39;t this part of trumps</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:22.250" style="s2">isn&#39;t this this thing that we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.070" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what the question is asking</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.250" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">are you can you make</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.350" end="00:06:35.170" style="s2">the intention here you know I watched</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.900" end="00:06:37.000" style="s2">the speech and was left very puzzled by</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.170" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">numerous parts of it including that line</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:41.800" style="s2">and I think it was very clearly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:44.290" style="s2">I&#39;m not even sure it was a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.800" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">thought I think the idea was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.290" end="00:06:50.410" style="s2">wink at that fraction of the electorate</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:55.030" style="s2">that sees the second amendment as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.410" end="00:06:56.530" style="s2">core of the Constitution and I will so</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.030" end="00:06:57.790" style="s2">let me just say the next question is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.530" end="00:06:59.290" style="s2">also about the second amendments maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.790" end="00:07:00.600" style="s2">we can we can talk about a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.290" end="00:07:02.470" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.600" end="00:07:04.300" style="s2">addressed to me Heather the Second</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.470" end="00:07:06.370" style="s2">Amendment is as profound a right as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:07.990" style="s2">first some mayors and governors would</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.370" end="00:07:11.320" style="s2">have it otherwise a shot across their</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.990" end="00:07:13.150" style="s2">bow so I absolutely the second is as</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.320" end="00:07:15.610" style="s2">profound as the first you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.150" end="00:07:16.930" style="s2">Bill of Rights are all quite profound</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:21.150" style="s2">with the possible exception of the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:24.130" style="s2">which just seems less relevant now but</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.150" end="00:07:27.160" style="s2">so yeah I agree with you I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.130" end="00:07:29.980" style="s2">know why it bore particular mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.160" end="00:07:31.330" style="s2">there but the second part of this second</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.980" end="00:07:33.370" style="s2">question that we&#39;re addressing now with</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.330" end="00:07:36.250" style="s2">regard to the second amendment may may</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.370" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">be part of it that this was a wink</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.250" end="00:07:45.820" style="s2">perhaps not so much to would-be</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:48.010" style="s2">enthusiasts of a civil war but a poke</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.820" end="00:07:52.260" style="s2">rather than a wink at the mayors and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.010" end="00:07:54.640" style="s2">governors who are publicly and famously</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.260" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">opposed to the way the Second Amendment</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.640" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">is being realized in America today a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:01.060" style="s2">couple things one I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:02.410" style="s2">Second Amendment is as profound as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.060" end="00:08:04.030" style="s2">first and I don&#39;t think it can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.410" end="00:08:07.419" style="s2">because the first can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.030" end="00:08:08.760" style="s2">unambiguous and the fact is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.419" end="00:08:11.110" style="s2">have a right to a nuclear weapon</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.760" end="00:08:12.820" style="s2">therefore your right to bear arms is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.110" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">inherently limited and where we draw</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.820" end="00:08:15.850" style="s2">those lines is inherently less</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:18.100" style="s2">interesting than whether we let you say</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.850" end="00:08:20.830" style="s2">whatever it is that you feel you should</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.100" end="00:08:22.510" style="s2">say well and the first also and I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.830" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">remember all of them but it has you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.510" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">it has this remarkable it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.580" end="00:08:28.919" style="s2">beautifully constructed sentence or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">few sentences I can&#39;t remember but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.919" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">beautifully constructed thing which</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:34.450" style="s2">basically goes from the most personal to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:36.279" style="s2">the most public with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.450" end="00:08:39.339" style="s2">freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.279" end="00:08:41.139" style="s2">of you know thoughts thoughts that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.339" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">may have in the which doesn&#39;t go in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.139" end="00:08:45.009" style="s2">opposite direction I can&#39;t remember it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:48.220" style="s2">now but it covers all range of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.009" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">from what you believe - what&#39;d you say -</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.220" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">what you proclaim and where you can say</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:55.300" style="s2">it and how you can how you can exchange</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:57.069" style="s2">the ideas and so you know really does</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.300" end="00:09:02.379" style="s2">cover all of these bases so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.069" end="00:09:04.870" style="s2">know it is it&#39;s a larger scope of of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.379" end="00:09:07.269" style="s2">amendments than the second yeah now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.870" end="00:09:08.709" style="s2">second is potentially very important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.269" end="00:09:11.850" style="s2">I should say this is one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.709" end="00:09:14.889" style="s2">that I run afoul of our liberal friends</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.850" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">is that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a slam-dunk</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.889" end="00:09:18.970" style="s2">that the Second Amendment is just an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:22.029" style="s2">anachronism I think it it is about</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.970" end="00:09:24.339" style="s2">tyranny and there&#39;s a question about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.029" end="00:09:28.660" style="s2">relevant the arms that citizens can have</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.339" end="00:09:29.980" style="s2">are to full-scale governmental tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.660" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">are there actually art there are there</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.980" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">people arguing that everything about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:35.559" style="s2">Second Amendment is an anachronism like</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">I actually don&#39;t don&#39;t know that to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.559" end="00:09:39.189" style="s2">position that&#39;s live now well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:42.209" style="s2">the craziest position in the world I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.189" end="00:09:45.790" style="s2">mean the fact is you know muzzleloading</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.209" end="00:09:47.379" style="s2">muskets or you know just not a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.790" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">model so the people who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.379" end="00:09:52.029" style="s2">amendment didn&#39;t really understand what</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:56.649" style="s2">what the amendment would end up covering</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.029" end="00:09:59.110" style="s2">yep but on the other hand yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.649" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">is phrased in a way that it makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.110" end="00:10:05.649" style="s2">curious statement right the the invoking</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:08.259" style="s2">of the concept of a militia being the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.649" end="00:10:10.269" style="s2">justification for the right to bear arms</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.259" end="00:10:12.759" style="s2">not being infringed is a head-scratcher</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.269" end="00:10:15.339" style="s2">at some level so anyway there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.759" end="00:10:17.559" style="s2">ink spilled on this of course but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.339" end="00:10:19.209" style="s2">basic point is I think it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.559" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">tyranny and I think it&#39;s still relevant</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.209" end="00:10:26.470" style="s2">and that means that at some level we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:28.709" style="s2">paying a huge price annually for this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.470" end="00:10:32.290" style="s2">hedge against tyranny which presumably</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.709" end="00:10:35.290" style="s2">hasn&#39;t reared its ugly head in recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.290" end="00:10:36.429" style="s2">memory because you know the firearms</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.290" end="00:10:39.100" style="s2">that would be relevant to it haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.429" end="00:10:40.149" style="s2">been utilized so anyway we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.100" end="00:10:42.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a hedge against something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.149" end="00:10:45.070" style="s2">might happen on the other hand at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:48.670" style="s2">moment that we have soldiers being</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.070" end="00:10:51.460" style="s2">now deployed with bayonets to go keep</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.670" end="00:10:53.140" style="s2">peace amongst Americans on American soil</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.460" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.140" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">and you know the problem is to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">extent that your personal weapons might</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:04.960" style="s2">be used to fend off tyranny look at what</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:07.480" style="s2">you&#39;re up against you&#39;re up against the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.960" end="00:11:09.070" style="s2">American military you know so I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.480" end="00:11:11.230" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;s not where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.070" end="00:11:13.330" style="s2">you know the thing I tweeted just before</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.230" end="00:11:14.830" style="s2">we went online here was that in light of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.330" end="00:11:16.960" style="s2">the bayonets this was a good moment for</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.830" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">patriotic Americans to remind each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.960" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">that following immoral orders is immoral</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.740" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">and I really think that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:27.280" style="s2">central concept and I must say what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:31.180" style="s2">expect to happen if the order for</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.280" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">tyranny comes down from the top I expect</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.180" end="00:11:35.980" style="s2">the military to reject it right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:39.640" style="s2">what you should do that&#39;s what you must</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.980" end="00:11:42.220" style="s2">do and I expect you to do it if that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.640" end="00:11:45.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen what happens with you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.220" end="00:11:48.790" style="s2">know I think I&#39;m probably happy that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.010" end="00:11:51.580" style="s2">population is well enough armed that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.790" end="00:11:53.550" style="s2">simply will not roll over in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.580" end="00:11:56.710" style="s2">tyranny and I think there are great many</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.550" end="00:12:00.070" style="s2">very decent Americans who have weapons</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.710" end="00:12:03.310" style="s2">and will protect people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.070" end="00:12:04.780" style="s2">them if it comes to it so I find it odd</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.310" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">that we are now talking about that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.780" end="00:12:09.370" style="s2">real time as if it might be just around</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:09.940" style="s2">the corner but you know in light of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.370" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">bayonets</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.940" end="00:12:12.970" style="s2">how much farther down the road are we</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">with bayonets today than we were</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:20.530" style="s2">yesterday at the threat of martial law</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:22.900" style="s2">yeah well we saw we saw some evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.530" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">this three years ago when Everton was</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.900" end="00:12:29.350" style="s2">blowing up and there was a moment before</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:33.010" style="s2">we actually fled the state and our home</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.350" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">with our children because the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.010" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">violence was so real and a few among our</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:42.490" style="s2">friends only one of whom I knew in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:45.730" style="s2">advance had a concealed carry permit</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.490" end="00:12:48.940" style="s2">revealed themselves to to have arms and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.730" end="00:12:51.700" style="s2">to be prepared to stand at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.940" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">our driveway and defend us and we you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.700" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">know we thank them and for their for</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:59.250" style="s2">their courage and for their</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:05.290" style="s2">friendship and said we didn&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.250" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">but it was it was a surprise and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.290" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">safer for it yeah actually now I always</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.529" end="00:13:14.860" style="s2">feel the need to add when you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">this that we left the state because we</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.860" end="00:13:20.649" style="s2">had children and because members of our</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.649" end="00:13:24.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t see us as having a choice I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.810" end="00:13:26.649" style="s2">not have left and there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.820" end="00:13:30.640" style="s2">that regrets leaving but yes it was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.649" end="00:13:32.470" style="s2">right choice to do it all right there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.640" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">there is much more to be said about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.470" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">second amendment but maybe we&#39;ll leave</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">that for there for now</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:43.209" style="s2">let&#39;s see so are we on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:44.709" style="s2">the pandemic or just getting of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.209" end="00:13:48.370" style="s2">second wave that will come crashing down</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.709" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">harder than before I see no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.370" end="00:13:52.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:54.130" style="s2">pandemic yeah it&#39;s not talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.120" end="00:13:55.570" style="s2">very much we&#39;re not talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.130" end="00:13:58.149" style="s2">there&#39;s some bad information floating</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.570" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">around from Italy about what&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.149" end="00:14:02.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know this a report came out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:06.339" style="s2">not convinced something wasn&#39;t lost in</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.500" end="00:14:09.579" style="s2">translation that suggested that the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.339" end="00:14:11.410" style="s2">virus was losing potency when in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.579" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">the whole thing was confounded by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.410" end="00:14:15.850" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re getting better at</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">figuring out how to fight it we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.850" end="00:14:20.680" style="s2">better at not spreading it and so these</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:21.790" style="s2">things look it looks like it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.680" end="00:14:23.200" style="s2">less dangerous but that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.790" end="00:14:24.610" style="s2">anything to say about whether the virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.200" end="00:14:26.500" style="s2">is becoming less dangerous and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.610" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">more I mean potency is also I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.500" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m wrong I think not a term of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">medical art like virulence is a term of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:36.070" style="s2">art but with this Pope like what does</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:37.300" style="s2">potency me lethality was the implication</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.070" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">but the question is why is it less</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.300" end="00:14:42.579" style="s2">lethal and even even let&#39;s say the virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">that is being seen in Italy there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.579" end="00:14:45.820" style="s2">argument to be made that it is less</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:48.850" style="s2">lethal that doesn&#39;t have anything to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">about the viruses that departed from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.850" end="00:14:54.519" style="s2">tree and left that branch the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:56.620" style="s2">phylogenetic tree right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.519" end="00:15:00.120" style="s2">at some level the virus isn&#39;t the virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.620" end="00:15:02.980" style="s2">the virus is innumerable</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.120" end="00:15:04.810" style="s2">lineages separate from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.980" end="00:15:06.940" style="s2">the fact that one of them may be showing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.810" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">some sign of something is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.940" end="00:15:10.279" style="s2">interesting if it is and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.649" style="s2">convinced that this Italian report tells</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.279" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">us that it was but even if it did it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.649" end="00:15:16.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say anything about some virus</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s disconnected from it in some</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.610" end="00:15:21.320" style="s2">other part of the world so yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:22.610" style="s2">we are about to see another wave by</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">virtue of the fact that we&#39;re opening</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.610" end="00:15:28.760" style="s2">back up and as we&#39;ve said many times</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.459" style="s2">there&#39;s an argument to be made for</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.760" end="00:15:34.610" style="s2">opening back up there really isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.459" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">argument to be made for not doing so in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.610" end="00:15:39.230" style="s2">an extremely careful and enlightened way</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.449" style="s2">you can probably afford to open the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.230" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">outdoor spaces back up you should</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.449" end="00:15:45.589" style="s2">probably wear masks when you go there</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:47.209" style="s2">but enjoy them make your vitamin D while</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.589" end="00:15:52.690" style="s2">you can because winter will be back I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.209" end="00:15:55.370" style="s2">promise and you know like that but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.690" end="00:15:58.389" style="s2">opening back up means enclosed spaces</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.370" end="00:16:02.630" style="s2">where the thing is transmitted and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.389" end="00:16:06.649" style="s2">very heightened level of enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.630" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">caution is the key way to allow opening</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.649" end="00:16:11.180" style="s2">back up not to produce a major new wave</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:19.220" style="s2">though it is effectively sure to cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.180" end="00:16:22.370" style="s2">some bump yeah if history serves if this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.220" end="00:16:25.760" style="s2">virus is like other viruses there will</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.370" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">at least be a second and perhaps a third</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.760" end="00:16:32.860" style="s2">wave maybe within a couple weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:38.120" style="s2">maybe in the fall in the northern fall</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.860" end="00:16:41.750" style="s2">and maybe again in next spring</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">sure again the vitamin D link is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.750" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">important here I have now begun to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:48.949" style="s2">the wider conversation take up the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:51.170" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been making about outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.949" end="00:16:52.819" style="s2">being safe so Pamela pesky had an</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.170" end="00:16:54.949" style="s2">article in New York Times couple days</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.819" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">ago that discussed the relative safety</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.949" end="00:16:59.959" style="s2">of outdoors and then there was another</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.269" style="s2">article who was a just I just saw it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.959" end="00:17:04.130" style="s2">today but anyway a couple a couple major</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.269" end="00:17:06.260" style="s2">publications have now begun discussing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.130" end="00:17:09.620" style="s2">the fact that outdoors for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.260" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">reason appears to be almost safe and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.620" end="00:17:14.569" style="s2">that that has implications on what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">ought to do one of them being in light</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.569" end="00:17:20.179" style="s2">of the fact that vitamin D seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">both preventive in terms of getting you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.179" end="00:17:24.350" style="s2">not to catch the disease and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:25.430" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable in terms of not getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.350" end="00:17:27.650" style="s2">very sick from it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.430" end="00:17:28.730" style="s2">making your vitamin D now while the sun</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.650" end="00:17:32.270" style="s2">is shining here in the northern</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:34.750" style="s2">hemisphere makes so much sense so if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.270" end="00:17:38.840" style="s2">do that now then when it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.750" end="00:17:41.330" style="s2">there&#39;ll be less illness yep next</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.840" end="00:17:42.410" style="s2">question Heather Bret agreed with you on</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.330" end="00:17:44.750" style="s2">white nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.410" end="00:17:46.970" style="s2">the notion that is constantly spoken it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:48.530" style="s2">is utter nonsense most times is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.970" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">white nationalist or supremacist or</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.530" end="00:17:59.030" style="s2">whatever show up in public events thank</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:18:01.130" style="s2">you yeah you know I think if my cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">idea of what white nationalists look</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.130" end="00:18:07.240" style="s2">like is right and I don&#39;t know if it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:09.620" style="s2">they like antifa</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.240" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">tend to show up and want to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.620" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">identified as such white nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.440" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be cryptic now maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.040" style="s2">wrong if if they were trying to incite</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">violence in the streets without it being</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.040" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">clear that it was them such that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:25.550" style="s2">was a reason then it was explicable why</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:27.050" style="s2">they then showed up then perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.550" end="00:18:31.610" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be seeing evidence of them now</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.050" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">but in in general you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.610" end="00:18:34.970" style="s2">show up and they&#39;re proud of it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:37.010" style="s2">they&#39;re proud of who they are and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.970" end="00:18:38.510" style="s2">tea for the same way you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.010" end="00:18:39.620" style="s2">tell who&#39;s who where the DFO because</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.510" end="00:18:46.270" style="s2">they&#39;re masked even when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.620" end="00:18:49.040" style="s2">pandemic times but let me say this</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.270" end="00:18:50.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your dyed-in-the-wool white</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.040" end="00:18:52.310" style="s2">nationalists who are committed that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.750" end="00:18:54.230" style="s2">is the right answer and there will be no</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.310" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">reasoning with them and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.230" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">a lot of people who are flirting with</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:19:00.290" style="s2">the idea because superficially it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:02.300" style="s2">like the solution to some problem we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.290" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2">have a race problem hey this would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.300" end="00:19:06.620" style="s2">one way to solve it right well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.520" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">think so and I would like those of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.620" end="00:19:11.210" style="s2">who are flirting with this idea to think</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">very very carefully of what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.210" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">you are actually proposing and what it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:19.670" style="s2">would mean and also to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.940" end="00:19:22.970" style="s2">possibility that we are not that far</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.670" end="00:19:28.180" style="s2">from a society that works that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.970" end="00:19:31.300" style="s2">multiracial and that were we to reach it</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.180" end="00:19:34.690" style="s2">you would be so much the better for it</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.300" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">the the burden of suspect</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.690" end="00:19:40.840" style="s2">other people on the basis of their</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">lineage is so great that really guys</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.840" end="00:19:46.030" style="s2">consider just giving it up alright I</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:48.580" style="s2">want you throw your lot in with the rest</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.030" end="00:19:50.980" style="s2">of us let&#39;s fix this and let&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.580" end="00:19:53.770" style="s2">benefit from having done so it&#39;s by far</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.980" end="00:20:00.700" style="s2">the easiest route and the most honorable</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.770" end="00:20:01.930" style="s2">route I see no other path say that to</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.130" end="00:20:16.800" style="s2">each give two pillars you would want in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:18.760" style="s2">such a religion yeah I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.800" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">unfortunately the hard part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.760" end="00:20:25.000" style="s2">narrowing it to two pillars and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:27.460" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously a question of accepting</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.000" end="00:20:29.770" style="s2">the premise of yeah having a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.460" end="00:20:33.640" style="s2">I&#39;m having a hard time with the promise</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.770" end="00:20:35.770" style="s2">of putting putting something that is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.640" end="00:20:37.660" style="s2">be taken on faith into people&#39;s heads</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.770" end="00:20:39.130" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.660" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">interesting question but I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.130" end="00:20:45.190" style="s2">literally not spent any time on this on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:48.670" style="s2">this premise I would I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.190" end="00:20:52.180" style="s2">perhaps come back to this good time but</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.670" end="00:20:57.060" style="s2">there you go I will say I&#39;d like to just</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.180" end="00:20:59.530" style="s2">fix the premise and say if we replace</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.060" end="00:21:02.890" style="s2">religion with something that is doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.530" end="00:21:05.020" style="s2">the job of religion in your hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.890" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">scenario here then the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.020" end="00:21:10.750" style="s2">pillars would be important to include</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:13.720" style="s2">and there are many in fact we have a a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.750" end="00:21:17.460" style="s2">Chanukah tradition where each night we</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.720" end="00:21:20.470" style="s2">go through one of what we think are</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.460" end="00:21:23.380" style="s2">foundational principles that are worthy</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.470" end="00:21:26.290" style="s2">of revisiting annually so any way we</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.380" end="00:21:29.890" style="s2">could pick any of those but two of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.290" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">would be don&#39;t game honorable systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.890" end="00:21:36.850" style="s2">that would be one and that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:41.130" style="s2">proposing something new that might have</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.850" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">a downside it has to be sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.130" end="00:21:45.310" style="s2">reversible that is to say if it turns</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:47.530" style="s2">out it was some kind of a big error you</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.310" end="00:21:49.570" style="s2">have to be able to undo it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.530" end="00:21:52.600" style="s2">before you are allowed to do it in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.570" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">first place very good yeah and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.600" end="00:21:58.810" style="s2">just to pick two others from that list</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:22:01.570" style="s2">that will be known to the listeners the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.810" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">golden rule is of course on there do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.570" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">unto others as you would have them do</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:07.480" style="s2">unto you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:09.640" style="s2">and the precautionary principle which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.480" end="00:22:14.920" style="s2">related to one of the ones that you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.640" end="00:22:16.150" style="s2">said yep okay how many potential COBIT</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.920" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">19 deaths will result from these</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.150" end="00:22:23.230" style="s2">protests and riots so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">addressed that ish at the end of the I</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.230" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">would say extreme among the many many</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:32.440" style="s2">reasons not to engage in looting</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:35.680" style="s2">diluting is taking place indoors and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.440" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">is much safer to be outdoors so add it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.680" end="00:22:40.540" style="s2">to your list of reasons if you were on</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">the fence about looting you have about a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.540" end="00:22:44.350" style="s2">thousand independently sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">reasons this is on the list somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.350" end="00:22:48.610" style="s2">yeah good do you have any plans to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.830" style="s2">divide your live streams into a series</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.610" end="00:22:54.700" style="s2">of smaller videos edited by topic like</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.830" end="00:22:56.350" style="s2">Gerry clips yes we should it is a large</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:22:57.970" style="s2">task and we have not figured out yet how</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.350" end="00:23:00.700" style="s2">to get it done yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.970" end="00:23:02.350" style="s2">were we able to push a button and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.700" end="00:23:03.430" style="s2">it happen this is something we would</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.350" end="00:23:07.990" style="s2">have done a long time ago it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.430" end="00:23:09.250" style="s2">definitely on the list from a Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.990" end="00:23:12.070" style="s2">perspective what is the value of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.250" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">conscience conscience life conscience</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.070" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">like a moral responsibility yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:20.920" style="s2">gonna just quickly say you know Brett</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">actually wrote a paper on the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.920" end="00:23:24.370" style="s2">of morality along with our friend David</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:24.760" style="s2">lotta you and here co-authors on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.370" end="00:23:28.930" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.760" end="00:23:32.890" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s terrific and if I think it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.930" end="00:23:35.320" style="s2">I will put that in the link yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.890" end="00:23:37.270" style="s2">basic in the in the description of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.320" end="00:23:39.700" style="s2">video the basic answer is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.270" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">going to be something on a temporal</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.700" end="00:23:44.740" style="s2">scale or a spatial scale that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:48.250" style="s2">valuable which is not recovered I narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.740" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">self-interest and so conscience is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.250" end="00:23:57.340" style="s2">basically a corrective lens that causes</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">an increase in well-being over time or</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.340" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2">space so any way you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:04.660" style="s2">you can you can try all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:07.540" style="s2">examples where there&#39;s something that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.660" end="00:24:09.220" style="s2">you did it would result in an immediate</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.540" end="00:24:10.750" style="s2">benefit to you but it would make you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.220" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">feel guilty so you don&#39;t do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.750" end="00:24:16.059" style="s2">if you think about what the guilt is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:17.410" style="s2">proxy for it actually maintains a kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.059" end="00:24:20.790" style="s2">of good that will be destroyed if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.410" end="00:24:23.290" style="s2">were to engage in that action okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.790" end="00:24:25.059" style="s2">echo asks can you both give your</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.290" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">evolutionary perspective on beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.059" end="00:24:28.630" style="s2">the beauty we perceive in landscapes and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:31.960" style="s2">objects related to how well they match</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.630" end="00:24:35.710" style="s2">our historical niches B G good habitat</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.960" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">food preferences tool efficiency it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.710" end="00:24:43.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a beautiful question yeah in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:47.290" style="s2">and I think every one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.960" end="00:24:51.160" style="s2">you can assess whether or not something</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.290" end="00:24:53.890" style="s2">has evolutionary efficacy is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.160" end="00:24:56.860" style="s2">universal it is across across cultures</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.890" end="00:24:59.800" style="s2">and there is a sense of aesthetic there</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.860" end="00:25:01.660" style="s2">is you know a philosophy of us a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.800" end="00:25:03.370" style="s2">philosophy of aesthetics and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.660" end="00:25:07.210" style="s2">aesthetic in all of the major religions</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.370" end="00:25:08.410" style="s2">and I believe in pretty much every</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.210" end="00:25:09.850" style="s2">culture where it&#39;s been looked at</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.410" end="00:25:11.380" style="s2">although anthropologists haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.850" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">focused on that as much so it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.380" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">know what its absence might mean in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:21.610" style="s2">places where it hasn&#39;t been noted so yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:25.210" style="s2">in part what we find beautiful has has</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.610" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">been linked with those places like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.210" end="00:25:29.290" style="s2">say here you know good habitat food</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">preferences I&#39;m less sure about tool</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.290" end="00:25:32.590" style="s2">efficiency but probably actually with</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:34.750" style="s2">regard to for instance this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.590" end="00:25:38.140" style="s2">beautiful knife that you you have behind</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.750" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">you here that our friend Dave made for</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.140" end="00:25:44.830" style="s2">you you know why why do we find the cut</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">of a particular blade beautiful as</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.830" end="00:25:49.030" style="s2">opposed to another and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:51.179" style="s2">without without being you know myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.030" end="00:25:53.230" style="s2">say just you know a knife maker or</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.179" end="00:25:56.050" style="s2">someone who is used knives for anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.230" end="00:25:58.360" style="s2">but pretty banal tasks I still know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.050" end="00:26:00.190" style="s2">beautiful blade when I see it and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.360" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">suspicion is that is pretty well mapped</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.190" end="00:26:04.990" style="s2">on to those blades that will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:07.730" style="s2">efficient and effective for the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.990" end="00:26:09.769" style="s2">that they are best designed for</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:11.419" style="s2">yeah I would say it&#39;s a proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.769" end="00:26:14.019" style="s2">goodness it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.419" end="00:26:16.399" style="s2">proxy but it&#39;s a proxy for goodness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.019" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive feedback in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.399" end="00:26:22.070" style="s2">because to the extent let&#39;s say you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.860" end="00:26:24.200" style="s2">some natural preference for some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.070" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">beauty that is correlated to some kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.200" end="00:26:28.279" style="s2">of goodness let&#39;s say it isn&#39;t in a tool</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.139" style="s2">or something like that your mind has</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.279" end="00:26:31.929" style="s2">some sense of symmetry and balance or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.139" end="00:26:35.809" style="s2">something that causes one blade to look</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.929" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">good well then that beautiful blade that</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.809" end="00:26:40.070" style="s2">then you use and it&#39;s very effective</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">reinforces the part of the proxy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.070" end="00:26:43.639" style="s2">accurate and so you can actually imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:46.460" style="s2">that the proxy would get refined through</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.639" end="00:26:48.169" style="s2">use and you know you you would become</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.460" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">more sensitive to what was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.169" end="00:26:51.500" style="s2">beautiful blade and what was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:54.200" style="s2">bit bit of a counterfeit or something</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.500" end="00:26:57.590" style="s2">like that so anyway you would it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.200" end="00:26:59.480" style="s2">be a refine able proxy for goodness over</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.590" end="00:27:02.090" style="s2">time ya know and the fact I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.480" end="00:27:04.460" style="s2">just to pick up on blades you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.090" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">fact that a knife with a broken tip or</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:36.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t cheap for me to put that comment</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.179" end="00:27:38.600" style="s2">and hit the list so listen up know our</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.220" end="00:27:40.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve got two teenage boys and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.580" end="00:27:48.409" style="s2">yeah yeah yes you can&#39;t have them let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:50.179" style="s2">see why is it automatically assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.409" end="00:27:51.740" style="s2">if a white policeman abuses or harms a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.179" end="00:27:54.289" style="s2">black suspect that that is an instance</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.740" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">of racism isn&#39;t that one tribal and to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.289" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">surrendered to a false definition of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:28:00.230" style="s2">racism yeah and I think I mean this I</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:01.730" style="s2">presume that this came in before we</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.230" end="00:28:06.769" style="s2">actually talked about this in the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.730" end="00:28:10.639" style="s2">live stream it&#39;s it it is an error it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.769" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">a it&#39;s a fallacy and it is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.639" end="00:28:17.059" style="s2">more likely that then if the races were</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:20.120" style="s2">reversed that people would think it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.059" end="00:28:21.970" style="s2">racism or that it was because of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.120" end="00:28:24.700" style="s2">history has looked like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.970" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">it isn&#39;t apparently racism at all that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.700" end="00:28:30.370" style="s2">you know what I say in my initial 14</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:33.790" style="s2">points you know some cops are racist</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.370" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">thugs well simply by statistical</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.790" end="00:28:38.830" style="s2">inference more cops than that are simply</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.950" end="00:28:40.900" style="s2">thugs that you add racist to the mix and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.830" end="00:28:44.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a smaller group and therefore less</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.900" end="00:28:47.320" style="s2">likely so there are more there are more</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.680" end="00:28:50.050" style="s2">bad cops out there who are just thuggish</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.320" end="00:28:51.460" style="s2">than are also racist and thuggish and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.050" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2">course the vast majority of them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.460" end="00:28:59.460" style="s2">neither you know it&#39;s funny how often</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.220" end="00:29:02.260" style="s2">Rodney King&#39;s famous line comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.460" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">can&#39;t we all just get along</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.260" end="00:29:09.040" style="s2">I must say I found that line haunting</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.830" style="s2">and endearing when he first said it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.040" end="00:29:16.210" style="s2">it has stuck with me and at some level</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.830" end="00:29:17.920" style="s2">you know I I get that we have a race</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.210" end="00:29:19.990" style="s2">problem that&#39;s interfacing badly with</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.920" end="00:29:22.210" style="s2">police but for God&#39;s sake him people can</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.990" end="00:29:28.120" style="s2">we just get over this seriously it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.210" end="00:29:30.520" style="s2">helping us it&#39;s not what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.120" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">about Mike Pence you see the real you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.520" end="00:29:37.590" style="s2">see the religious lunatic people say he</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:39.400" style="s2">has boy you got something I&#39;m a knight I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.590" end="00:29:41.380" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought a lot about Mike Pence</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.400" end="00:29:42.940" style="s2">honestly like I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll just answer</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.380" end="00:29:47.290" style="s2">off-the-cuff I haven&#39;t given him a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.940" end="00:29:50.850" style="s2">of thought he was easy to mock for him</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.290" end="00:29:59.050" style="s2">being you know almost bible-thumping II</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.850" end="00:30:03.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t want him to be president but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.050" end="00:30:06.340" style="s2">not sure that he&#39;s a complete lunatic</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.550" end="00:30:09.100" style="s2">like people say he is I don&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.340" end="00:30:10.330" style="s2">don&#39;t have a bead on him really well I</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.100" end="00:30:15.900" style="s2">don&#39;t want him to be president for</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.330" end="00:30:15.900" style="s2">Policy reasons it&#39;s possible that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.050" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know I let&#39;s put it this way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.820" end="00:30:22.120" style="s2">damned if I do and damned if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:26.350" style="s2">hear because in some sense I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.120" end="00:30:27.970" style="s2">anything about him that yes I find him</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.350" end="00:30:30.040" style="s2">curious and some of the things he</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.970" end="00:30:34.120" style="s2">apparently believes seem strange to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.040" end="00:30:35.570" style="s2">but in archaic right I mean he&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.120" end="00:30:37.850" style="s2">pre-modern do</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.570" end="00:30:40.999" style="s2">at some level whose in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.850" end="00:30:41.690" style="s2">highest offices in the land yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.999" end="00:30:43.850" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.690" end="00:30:45.700" style="s2">paradoxical about that you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.850" end="00:30:48.109" style="s2">thrown by Amish people in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.700" end="00:30:49.669" style="s2">pre-modern hope but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.109" end="00:30:52.369" style="s2">vice-president right that&#39;s the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.669" end="00:30:55.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so I guess my point then is if</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.369" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">it&#39;s the context that makes Mike Pence a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.190" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">troubling phenomenon I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:00.229" style="s2">necessarily want to hold him responsible</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:02.769" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.229" end="00:31:04.789" style="s2">I guess I&#39;d also say that you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.769" end="00:31:06.379" style="s2">we&#39;ve known I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.789" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">any Amish people but we know some</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.379" end="00:31:13.220" style="s2">Mennonites and I would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:14.840" style="s2">pleased to have some you know at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.220" end="00:31:17.479" style="s2">one Mennonite in particular I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.840" end="00:31:22.909" style="s2">of and you know I&#39;m thinking of be in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.479" end="00:31:25.779" style="s2">position of power and it is a because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.909" end="00:31:28.849" style="s2">know him so very well and it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.779" end="00:31:30.590" style="s2">position that is so carefully</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.849" end="00:31:32.749" style="s2">thought-out and not based on received</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.590" end="00:31:35.179" style="s2">wisdom and the at least the cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.749" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">thing in my head about Mike Pence is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.179" end="00:31:38.359" style="s2">DS just sort of receive I&#39;m a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:40.849" style="s2">and I take what&#39;s written in this book</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.359" end="00:31:43.549" style="s2">as that&#39;s literally the Word of God and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.849" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">that is a that is a received wisdom sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.549" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">of authoritarian take that I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">in a leader yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.179" end="00:31:56.149" style="s2">thank you for also sharing the data</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.229" end="00:31:59.210" style="s2">about the reality of these police</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.149" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">killings of black folks greater chance</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.210" end="00:32:04.700" style="s2">of being struck by lightning literally</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:05.749" style="s2">love you both I don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.700" end="00:32:09.710" style="s2">the greater chance of being struck by</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.749" end="00:32:11.779" style="s2">lightning refers to that is you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.710" end="00:32:14.179" style="s2">but a black person is more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.779" end="00:32:16.609" style="s2">struck by lightning than to be killed by</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.179" end="00:32:18.200" style="s2">a cop it is what I think that means I</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.609" end="00:32:20.479" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true it seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.200" end="00:32:22.820" style="s2">could well be I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.479" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">question there though right thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.820" end="00:32:25.369" style="s2">the honest commentary from Texas you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:27.409" style="s2">welcome</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.369" end="00:32:28.789" style="s2">consider that rioting makes everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.409" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">feel the pain of the oppressed and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.789" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">ignored have you considered the looting</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">reflects racial financial inequality</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.229" end="00:32:42.349" style="s2">yeah whenever Green was melting down we</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.619" end="00:32:45.560" style="s2">repeatedly made the point that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.349" end="00:32:48.160" style="s2">problem with the movement was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.560" end="00:32:53.420" style="s2">instead of ending racism it appeared to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.160" end="00:32:55.340" style="s2">be interested in turning the tables so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.420" end="00:32:58.340" style="s2">there is I think a deep-seated</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.340" end="00:33:02.540" style="s2">primordial instinct to turn the tables</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.340" end="00:33:04.820" style="s2">and to simply destroy but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.540" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">say is look the great leaders who have</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.820" end="00:33:12.440" style="s2">gotten us past major in justices have</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:17.180" style="s2">understood that they need discipline</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.440" end="00:33:22.790" style="s2">that they need to be they need to resist</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.180" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">base impulses in order to to reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.790" end="00:33:27.020" style="s2">hypocrisy of the system they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:29.420" style="s2">challenging and this protest is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.020" end="00:33:32.810" style="s2">thoroughly failing to do that that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.420" end="00:33:35.630" style="s2">think for all of us who frankly I you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.810" end="00:33:37.850" style="s2">know I am frustrated I do think we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.630" end="00:33:38.750" style="s2">falling down on our obligation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.850" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">think we&#39;re falling down on our</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.750" end="00:33:42.620" style="s2">obligation for the same reason that many</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.030" style="s2">of the protesters feel that we are I</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.620" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">think there&#39;s a diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.030" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">problem where the the things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:53.930" style="s2">continue to cause racial injustice have</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:55.460" style="s2">become subtle and because they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.930" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">subtle there&#39;s a frustration about not</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.460" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">being able to name them and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.920" style="s2">temptation to point to things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.580" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">aren&#39;t exactly right and and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.920" end="00:34:08.390" style="s2">but if you&#39;re going to force change then</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:10.850" style="s2">you need to think about perceptions and</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.480" end="00:34:59.960" style="s2">would I have the problem with white</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.310" end="00:35:04.270" style="s2">nationalism is that it seeks a white</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.410" end="00:35:48.770" style="s2">evolutionary perspective why do some</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">believe this and virtue signal it about</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.770" end="00:35:56.270" style="s2">virtue signal about it on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:36:03.050" style="s2">Instagram when it is false yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.270" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">unfortunately my grandfather used to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.050" end="00:36:08.570" style="s2">frequently argue that education was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.960" end="00:36:09.860" style="s2">solution to all of our problems and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.570" end="00:36:11.870" style="s2">and I used to fight about this because</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.860" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t right there are lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.870" end="00:36:17.800" style="s2">that you could understand and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:20.840" style="s2">fix them but there is a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.800" end="00:36:23.210" style="s2">understanding them gives you a great</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.840" end="00:36:24.770" style="s2">advantage in figuring out how to address</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.210" end="00:36:26.390" style="s2">them I mean game theory is something I</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.770" end="00:36:28.100" style="s2">invoke all the time for this reason once</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.390" end="00:36:29.930" style="s2">you see the very simple dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.100" end="00:36:31.640" style="s2">cause something that should work not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.930" end="00:36:33.080" style="s2">work you can begin to say well what</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.640" end="00:36:36.020" style="s2">would have to be different in order to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.080" end="00:36:37.580" style="s2">make the thing function so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.020" end="00:36:41.270" style="s2">problem is lots of people have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.580" end="00:36:43.820" style="s2">failed by an educational system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.270" end="00:36:45.410" style="s2">so preposterous and so thoroughly fails</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.820" end="00:36:47.690" style="s2">to put in front of you the things you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.410" end="00:36:49.400" style="s2">need to know that they are just left</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.690" end="00:36:51.260" style="s2">adrift figuring out how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.400" end="00:36:53.780" style="s2">problems and it would be very nice</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.260" end="00:36:55.970" style="s2">if racism had no evolutionary basis I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.780" end="00:36:57.740" style="s2">would love that to be the case anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.970" end="00:37:00.440" style="s2">so much simpler the question really</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.740" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">though is how could it possibly be true</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.440" end="00:37:05.240" style="s2">how could it possibly be true the fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:07.190" style="s2">is a lineage of people that is capable</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.240" end="00:37:09.020" style="s2">of ganging up on other lineages of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.190" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">people has an advantage that a lineage</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.020" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">that can&#39;t figure out who it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:17.930" style="s2">to doesn&#39;t so it can&#39;t possibly be true</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:20.630" style="s2">what is true is that racial allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.930" end="00:37:22.369" style="s2">is not the only basis on which we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.630" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">move forward and those of us who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.369" end="00:37:26.180" style="s2">figured out how to put it aside have</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:27.710" style="s2">actually discovered that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.180" end="00:37:31.609" style="s2">tremendous amount of value to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.710" end="00:37:33.590" style="s2">unlocked in doing so so we don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.609" end="00:37:35.750" style="s2">to be true that there is no evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.590" end="00:37:38.150" style="s2">basis for racism in order for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.750" end="00:37:41.090" style="s2">past it many of us have and pretending</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.150" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s not true is going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.090" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">harder to move forward makes it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:47.030" style="s2">impossible because it means that your</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:49.190" style="s2">your your system is stacked on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.030" end="00:37:53.000" style="s2">foundation that&#39;s partially crumbling</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.190" end="00:37:54.970" style="s2">mythological okay so anyway I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.000" end="00:37:57.380" style="s2">know I think people are basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.970" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">confused about the nature of what they</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.380" end="00:38:02.119" style="s2">want to be true and what relationship it</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.240" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">has to what is true and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.119" end="00:38:06.230" style="s2">are many marvelous quotes from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:08.410" style="s2">history of science from some of our best</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.230" end="00:38:11.450" style="s2">minds there&#39;s one in particular from</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.410" end="00:38:13.250" style="s2">Medawar in which he says something to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.450" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">the effect of it&#39;s amazing how little</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.250" end="00:38:19.190" style="s2">effect what you want to be true has on</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:21.800" style="s2">what is true yeah and it&#39;s that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.190" end="00:38:23.180" style="s2">it&#39;s the reason that the concept that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.800" end="00:38:25.160" style="s2">the naturalistic fallacy has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.180" end="00:38:28.490" style="s2">formalized the way it has which is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.160" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">say the idea that what is true is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.490" end="00:38:34.220" style="s2">ought to be true is false it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:37.400" style="s2">simply it&#39;s a it&#39;s a false equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.220" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">and many people imagine it&#39;s some sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.400" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">of a mystical thing that once you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">understand what is and you speak it then</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:46.130" style="s2">it will become the thing that ought to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:47.990" style="s2">be true for all time and it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.130" end="00:38:50.090" style="s2">that you want to be true and know like</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.990" end="00:38:51.980" style="s2">you know what one thing that we one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.090" end="00:38:54.950" style="s2">the things that we speak to all the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.980" end="00:38:57.710" style="s2">is we understand if we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.950" end="00:38:59.630" style="s2">the evolutionary underpinnings of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.710" end="00:39:02.300" style="s2">we are and why we do the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.630" end="00:39:05.039" style="s2">do we will be much better equipped to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.300" end="00:39:07.619" style="s2">actually move away from those</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.039" end="00:39:08.939" style="s2">evolutionary underpinnings the the only</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.619" end="00:39:10.799" style="s2">thing our genes one of us have to make</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.939" end="00:39:12.959" style="s2">more of themselves in the future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.799" end="00:39:14.519" style="s2">not interesting we can do better we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.959" end="00:39:17.039" style="s2">do a lot better you can do a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.519" end="00:39:18.509" style="s2">the other problem though is there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.039" end="00:39:20.669" style="s2">sense and you know I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.509" end="00:39:22.229" style="s2">scientists are doing us any favors the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.669" end="00:39:24.119" style="s2">fact that the virology community has</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.229" end="00:39:25.829" style="s2">this fiction it likes which is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.119" end="00:39:28.709" style="s2">laboratory hypothesis couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.829" end="00:39:30.689" style="s2">rewrite that thing is effectively it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.709" end="00:39:33.299" style="s2">trying to take a fiction and impose it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.689" end="00:39:35.039" style="s2">as if it were a fact right we see this</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.299" end="00:39:36.599" style="s2">all the time coming out of the critical</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.039" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">theory crowd where they take something</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.599" end="00:39:39.329" style="s2">that they would like to be effect and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.890" end="00:39:40.799" style="s2">then they just assert that it is and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.329" end="00:39:43.529" style="s2">then the point is they go around</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.799" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">brutalizing people who say that isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.529" end="00:39:47.400" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s awful yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:49.140" style="s2">awful so those who swear that men and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.400" end="00:39:51.209" style="s2">women are two different phenomena it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.140" end="00:39:52.589" style="s2">like you know we&#39;re transphobes somehow</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.209" end="00:39:54.989" style="s2">yep really</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.589" end="00:39:57.059" style="s2">right that&#39;s what we are Oh fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.989" end="00:39:59.789" style="s2">oh and if you think that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.059" end="00:40:02.939" style="s2">relationship potentially between the you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.789" end="00:40:05.519" style="s2">know the level for virality lab in wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.939" end="00:40:07.229" style="s2">and the fact that a corona virus that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.519" end="00:40:09.179" style="s2">very similar to ones that they study</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.229" end="00:40:11.069" style="s2">happens to have emerged in wuhan you</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.179" end="00:40:11.729" style="s2">know what you are you&#39;re a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.069" end="00:40:14.279" style="s2">theorist</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.729" end="00:40:16.859" style="s2">this is authoritarian garbage right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.279" end="00:40:19.229" style="s2">not right anybody who needs to threaten</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.859" end="00:40:22.489" style="s2">you in order to bully you into a fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.229" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2">probably is not peddling a fact so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.489" end="00:40:28.349" style="s2">anyway and phobic conspiracy theorists a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.140" end="00:40:32.159" style="s2">transphobic can imagine boy my parents</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.349" end="00:40:34.499" style="s2">would be so disappointed more from this</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.930" end="00:41:23.869" style="s2">thing and then at the most remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.750" end="00:41:26.750" style="s2">moment during that proposal everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.869" end="00:41:30.380" style="s2">went technologically nuts and I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.750" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">trying not to imagine that that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.380" end="00:41:34.940" style="s2">something beyond a coincidence yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:37.400" style="s2">was I was watching from the other room</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.940" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">yeah and it was it was truly some</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.400" end="00:41:40.369" style="s2">stunning timing anyway but you should</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:42.349" style="s2">say what it is for for people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.369" end="00:41:44.869" style="s2">know it was a proposed here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.349" end="00:41:46.550" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it right with the details</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.869" end="00:41:48.410" style="s2">that didn&#39;t make it into that after the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.550" end="00:41:51.410" style="s2">technological collapse when we got back</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">online I was a little bit thrown by what</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.410" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">had happened it was I mean it was as</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">remarkable as it was for people watching</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:59.750" style="s2">you have no idea how dramatic it was to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:02.450" style="s2">have everything go haywire at once here</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.750" end="00:42:04.730" style="s2">so are you right right now or you okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.450" end="00:42:07.069" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it in an encapsulated thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.730" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">probably not live and I will upload it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.069" end="00:42:11.150" style="s2">and then you can see it so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">there&#39;s more to come but the basic thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.150" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">was there was a plan for bypassing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:23.630" style="s2">major parties and their decrepit clown</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:24.829" style="s2">candidates I particularly like the part</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.630" end="00:42:26.420" style="s2">where he keeps calling them decrepit</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.829" end="00:42:29.960" style="s2">clowns because that really is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.420" end="00:42:31.400" style="s2">accurate I I think it&#39;s a great idea I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.960" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to get the attention of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.400" end="00:42:41.809" style="s2">the people whose attention we need and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:44.930" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessary I don&#39;t I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.809" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">barrier that I have no idea how to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.930" end="00:42:48.440" style="s2">out of the way I think but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:51.140" style="s2">it&#39;s utterly necessary it felt necessary</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.440" end="00:42:53.630" style="s2">four years ago it feels even more</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.140" end="00:42:56.210" style="s2">necessary now yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.630" end="00:42:59.030" style="s2">history is doing us a favor right like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.210" end="00:43:00.740" style="s2">mean history is doing us no favors in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.030" end="00:43:03.349" style="s2">the sense that bayonets are being issued</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.740" end="00:43:05.990" style="s2">to American soldiers to go keep the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.349" end="00:43:08.420" style="s2">peace amongst American citizens but when</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.990" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">that kind of thing happens I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.420" end="00:43:12.980" style="s2">people who have been telling themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:14.869" style="s2">some story about what it is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.980" end="00:43:17.480" style="s2">do to get out of this problem are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.869" end="00:43:19.730" style="s2">start to realize that they have been set</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.480" end="00:43:22.730" style="s2">adrift in very dangerous circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.730" end="00:43:24.109" style="s2">with completely inadequate tooling and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.730" end="00:43:25.790" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.109" end="00:43:27.410" style="s2">outside the box and listening to people</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.790" end="00:43:29.480" style="s2">who&#39;ve already started thinking outside</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.410" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">the box because otherwise we ain&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.480" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.420" end="00:43:36.569" style="s2">it&#39;s a tragedy podcast like this don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.799" end="00:43:47.220" style="s2">disagree okay maybe I should rephrase</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.930" end="00:43:49.980" style="s2">that I agree</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.510" end="00:44:11.789" style="s2">realms that people are just unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.519" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">it that&#39;s right would you both consider</p>

<p begin="00:45:17.250" end="00:45:22.289" style="s2">time to independently assess and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.490" end="00:45:23.819" style="s2">honestly may well not get to it because</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.289" end="00:45:25.079" style="s2">there are so many things drawing our</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.819" end="00:45:28.619" style="s2">attention like what was it Banat</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.079" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">bayonets peanuts bayonets good okay I</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.619" end="00:45:31.799" style="s2">must not see experts and leaders the way</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.799" end="00:45:35.160" style="s2">I saw how she tried to explain it with</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.809" end="00:45:36.839" style="s2">the quote but wasn&#39;t she describing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.160" end="00:45:40.680" style="s2">freedom itself what purpose does a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.839" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">leader serve to you so I wonder which</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.680" end="00:45:44.140" style="s2">quote you&#39;re talking about is the quote</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:48.460" style="s2">from Trump or the quote from dust</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.140" end="00:45:51.610" style="s2">have ski I don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.460" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">yeah but I will say the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.610" end="00:46:03.430" style="s2">leadership is you know it&#39;s not we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:05.800" style="s2">a a simulacrum of leadership and it has</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.430" end="00:46:07.600" style="s2">confused us all because we have lost the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.800" end="00:46:11.050" style="s2">sense for what it&#39;s actually like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.600" end="00:46:14.130" style="s2">have a leader and so therefore we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.050" end="00:46:19.780" style="s2">know what it makes us capable of and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.130" end="00:46:22.180" style="s2">think probably people who have faced you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.780" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve been in a foxhole then</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.180" end="00:46:26.740" style="s2">you understand this intuitively if</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in a serious crisis you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.740" end="00:46:32.740" style="s2">understand it intuitively if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.750" end="00:46:35.080" style="s2">lived decades in America with the kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.740" end="00:46:37.060" style="s2">of nebulous Evan flow politics that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.080" end="00:46:40.900" style="s2">really isn&#39;t about you it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.060" end="00:46:43.120" style="s2">thin cover for a kind of corruption that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.900" end="00:46:46.090" style="s2">just you know has become so every day we</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.120" end="00:46:49.060" style="s2">don&#39;t even see it then you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.090" end="00:46:50.830" style="s2">what you&#39;re missing but you will if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.060" end="00:46:56.440" style="s2">can figure out how to bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.830" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">leadership back into existence do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.440" end="00:46:59.260" style="s2">think people in America today are</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:00.970" style="s2">working in the right direction to solve</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.260" end="00:47:09.640" style="s2">the issue of police brutality and racial</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:13.570" style="s2">profiling right now today no 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.640" end="00:47:15.940" style="s2">ago I would have said I thought so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.570" end="00:47:19.900" style="s2">thought we were we were moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.940" end="00:47:22.810" style="s2">right direction five years ago not so</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.900" end="00:47:26.950" style="s2">not so sure you know something is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.810" end="00:47:30.850" style="s2">shifting and it&#39;s becoming harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.950" end="00:47:32.530" style="s2">the right thing I think I mean I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.850" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">think the problems with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.530" end="00:47:38.350" style="s2">things there&#39;s a kind of reformer</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:40.690" style="s2">mentality and the point is actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.350" end="00:47:42.730" style="s2">we&#39;re so far off the mark that anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.690" end="00:47:44.170" style="s2">that falls under the term reform isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.730" end="00:47:46.780" style="s2">going to be sufficient so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.170" end="00:47:50.350" style="s2">mean by a reformer mentality that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.780" end="00:47:52.570" style="s2">know there&#39;s all of this verbage about</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.350" end="00:47:54.040" style="s2">here&#39;s the the plan what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.570" end="00:47:57.160" style="s2">do to address it and none of these plans</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.040" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">are ever very good and my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.160" end="00:47:59.740" style="s2">actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:02.680" style="s2">these things aren&#39;t a matter of tacking</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.740" end="00:48:03.940" style="s2">some new thing that corrects the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.680" end="00:48:07.600" style="s2">on to the old thing that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.940" end="00:48:10.090" style="s2">emphasized it&#39;s more like what</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.600" end="00:48:13.960" style="s2">assumption did we get wrong why does the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.090" end="00:48:16.810" style="s2">system work like this right and those</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.960" end="00:48:19.750" style="s2">things more often are a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.810" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">thinking very carefully and discovering</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.750" end="00:48:26.200" style="s2">the counterintuitive thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:28.300" style="s2">overlook the first time rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.200" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">more architecture designed to address</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.300" end="00:48:33.790" style="s2">the goddamn thing for once and for all</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">right so anyway my point would be reform</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.790" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">ISM to me is kind of uninteresting the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:41.770" style="s2">problem is the alternative to reform ISM</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.840" style="s2">is awful often understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.770" end="00:48:45.790" style="s2">something like revolution and that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.840" end="00:48:48.070" style="s2">absolutely cannot afford revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.790" end="00:48:50.500" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been saying is we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.070" end="00:48:51.970" style="s2">revolutionary change without revolution</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.500" end="00:48:57.310" style="s2">we need something that is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.970" end="00:49:00.550" style="s2">enlightened and brings us the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.310" end="00:49:02.560" style="s2">upgrade without the violence that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.550" end="00:49:06.580" style="s2">accompanies it and this is readily</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.560" end="00:49:07.810" style="s2">possible but it doesn&#39;t come from a sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.580" end="00:49:09.340" style="s2">of piecemeal approach this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.810" end="00:49:12.130" style="s2">things that absolutely drove me crazy</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.340" end="00:49:15.250" style="s2">about the primaries was this obsession</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.130" end="00:49:17.110" style="s2">over policy details like these people</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.250" end="00:49:19.180" style="s2">were supposed to be encyclopedic Lee</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.110" end="00:49:20.500" style="s2">aware of all of the nuances of policy</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.180" end="00:49:21.670" style="s2">and budget and all of this in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.500" end="00:49:23.140" style="s2">spell out exactly what they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.670" end="00:49:25.540" style="s2">do as president even though that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.140" end="00:49:28.090" style="s2">what presidents do and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.540" end="00:49:29.860" style="s2">just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a circus right</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.090" end="00:49:31.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not how it goes what you really</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.860" end="00:49:34.300" style="s2">want is somebody in the office who</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.960" end="00:49:35.950" style="s2">gathers the right people and can have</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.300" end="00:49:38.950" style="s2">the frank conversation where you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.950" end="00:49:39.580" style="s2">actually navigate your way to what did</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.950" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">we miss</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.580" end="00:49:44.170" style="s2">right yeah so before you said all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:46.840" style="s2">that I was thinking that there are sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.170" end="00:49:48.040" style="s2">of three categories of approach and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.840" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">one that you&#39;re calling the reformer</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.040" end="00:49:55.210" style="s2">approach is add more stuff to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.510" end="00:49:57.160" style="s2">architecture and see if that fixes the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.210" end="00:49:59.590" style="s2">problem and of course when it guarantees</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.160" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">is more bureaucracy more bureaucrats</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.590" end="00:50:04.630" style="s2">more middlemen and middle management and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">therefore will at the very least cause</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.630" end="00:50:10.210" style="s2">bloat and then at the opposite end</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:11.830" style="s2">excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.210" end="00:50:13.620" style="s2">you have you have revolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.830" end="00:50:16.150" style="s2">and this is you know this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.620" end="00:50:19.960" style="s2">revolution is sometimes necessary all</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.150" end="00:50:22.810" style="s2">right but the way that the anarchists as</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.960" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">you described in the last hour would</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.810" end="00:50:27.820" style="s2">have us do it just even burn it all down</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:29.410" style="s2">burn the whole thing down and let&#39;s hope</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.820" end="00:50:32.110" style="s2">that we get a great-looking Phoenix out</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.410" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">of the ashes not gonna happen all right</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.110" end="00:50:35.860" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">intermediate it&#39;s not an intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.860" end="00:50:39.550" style="s2">thing but there is an approach that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:41.140" style="s2">involves looking at what we have looking</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.550" end="00:50:42.730" style="s2">at this architecture and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.140" end="00:50:44.200" style="s2">saying let&#39;s put some more stuff up here</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.730" end="00:50:45.790" style="s2">or just let&#39;s destroy the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.200" end="00:50:48.040" style="s2">let&#39;s look at this architecture and look</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.790" end="00:50:50.290" style="s2">at the decision trees and go okay well</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.040" end="00:50:52.180" style="s2">that thing isn&#39;t working let&#39;s see if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.290" end="00:50:53.590" style="s2">can undo that back to there oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.180" end="00:50:54.700" style="s2">still not working back back back and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.590" end="00:50:56.440" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re gonna have to take out</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:50:57.970" style="s2">whole branches all right I&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.440" end="00:50:59.860" style="s2">branches of a tree or you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.970" end="00:51:00.790" style="s2">this is a systemic thing it&#39;s the forest</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.860" end="00:51:03.610" style="s2">so sometimes you&#39;ll have to take out</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:05.500" style="s2">whole trees but that doesn&#39;t mean burn</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.610" end="00:51:07.630" style="s2">the whole damn forest down and it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.500" end="00:51:10.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean add stuff on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.630" end="00:51:12.460" style="s2">trees it means let&#39;s selectively prune</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.120" end="00:51:15.420" style="s2">the things that we&#39;ve got and create</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.460" end="00:51:18.970" style="s2">better systems within a foundation that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.420" end="00:51:22.420" style="s2">you know are founded the foundation for</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.970" end="00:51:25.030" style="s2">instance this country is solid it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.420" end="00:51:26.500" style="s2">archaic in places it couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.030" end="00:51:28.750" style="s2">have predicted some of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.500" end="00:51:32.260" style="s2">dealing with now foundation our</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.750" end="00:51:35.230" style="s2">foundation is solid yep it&#39;s it strikes</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.260" end="00:51:37.900" style="s2">me that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s buckminster</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.230" end="00:51:39.190" style="s2">fuller&#39;s ephemeralization yeah learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.900" end="00:51:40.990" style="s2">to do more and more with less and less</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.190" end="00:51:44.170" style="s2">until eventually you can do everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.990" end="00:51:45.400" style="s2">with nothing and of course that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.170" end="00:51:47.650" style="s2">be taken literally but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.400" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">process is you want a more and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.650" end="00:51:50.710" style="s2">elegant system that is light</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:54.370" style="s2">light-handed</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.710" end="00:51:56.140" style="s2">that can do fantastic things and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.370" end="00:52:02.070" style="s2">know we see elements of this right we</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.140" end="00:52:06.180" style="s2">saw Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX put astronauts</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.070" end="00:52:10.390" style="s2">back into orbit under an American power</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.180" end="00:52:12.310" style="s2">once again and was fantastic right we</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.390" end="00:52:14.620" style="s2">see glimmers of this and then we see the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.310" end="00:52:16.570" style="s2">same people we see Elon also playing</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.620" end="00:52:19.800" style="s2">with the solution to the traffic problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.570" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">is a system of underground tubes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.800" end="00:52:27.020" style="s2">like you know he&#39;s got both impulses but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:28.610" style="s2">but anyway the point is people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.020" end="00:52:31.310" style="s2">thinking and you know you gotta give you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.610" end="00:52:33.140" style="s2">a loan credit for having the vision to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.310" end="00:52:34.700" style="s2">imagine that civilization could look</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.140" end="00:52:36.350" style="s2">like something different rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.700" end="00:52:39.190" style="s2">looking like an improved version of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.350" end="00:52:39.190" style="s2">saying yep</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.590" end="00:52:43.850" style="s2">Heather what is your favorite joke of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.690" end="00:52:45.910" style="s2">brats Brett what is your favorite joke</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.850" end="00:52:49.220" style="s2">of Brett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.910" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">I feel like this question came across</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.220" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">before we didn&#39;t get to it and instead</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:54.500" style="s2">of thinking about it I haven&#39;t and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:55.940" style="s2">think I don&#39;t I don&#39;t file things that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.500" end="00:52:57.230" style="s2">way I don&#39;t think you like my jokes</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.940" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.230" end="00:53:03.230" style="s2">it&#39;s actually that&#39;s really not true and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:05.990" style="s2">you know it I do but when I&#39;m asked</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.230" end="00:53:08.030" style="s2">almost any what&#39;s your favorite I freeze</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.990" end="00:53:10.190" style="s2">and I can&#39;t I can&#39;t remember even what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.030" end="00:53:12.110" style="s2">on the list I can&#39;t do it so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.190" end="00:53:16.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think you&#39;re funny</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.110" end="00:53:18.260" style="s2">love it&#39;s a little like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.070" end="00:53:21.290" style="s2">you have this thing but um the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.260" end="00:53:23.300" style="s2">mundane arithmetic becomes difficult at</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.290" end="00:53:24.920" style="s2">the chalkboard for me I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.300" end="00:53:27.140" style="s2">that is yeah I don&#39;t have that problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.920" end="00:53:28.550" style="s2">but but I see how it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.140" end="00:53:30.590" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s it&#39;s just not the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.550" end="00:53:32.270" style="s2">frame of mind I guess but yeah um okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.590" end="00:53:34.310" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know what my favorite joke is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.270" end="00:53:38.180" style="s2">but I do have a joke I&#39;ve been unable to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.310" end="00:53:40.100" style="s2">tell until now so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.180" end="00:53:42.230" style="s2">joke that you tell but it&#39;s one that I</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.230" end="00:53:46.580" style="s2">ability to deliver because I really</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.820" end="00:53:51.830" style="s2">thought it was high quality there was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.580" end="00:53:54.130" style="s2">point when John McCain a figure for whom</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.830" end="00:53:56.420" style="s2">I had a lot of respect but I understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.130" end="00:53:58.250" style="s2">there are some people who have you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.420" end="00:54:01.369" style="s2">regard him as a war criminal oh no I</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.250" end="00:54:05.000" style="s2">don&#39;t but anyway John McCain was dying</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.369" end="00:54:08.030" style="s2">of a brain tumor and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.000" end="00:54:10.520" style="s2">question about Trump attending his</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.030" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">memorial and John McCain had said that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.520" end="00:54:18.320" style="s2">he didn&#39;t want it and I very much felt</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:20.840" style="s2">like tweeting at him I wouldn&#39;t pick a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.320" end="00:54:24.290" style="s2">fight with him at this point but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.840" end="00:54:26.330" style="s2">your funeral but I couldn&#39;t I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.290" end="00:54:29.000" style="s2">would have been such bad taste and my</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.330" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">feeling is it&#39;s still too soon but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.000" end="00:54:32.690" style="s2">asked the questions so this is on you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.440" style="s2">yeah no this is this is we can blame</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.690" end="00:54:40.170" style="s2">Elliott yeah thanks Elliott</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.440" end="00:54:43.609" style="s2">yeah now I should say I also the day</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.170" end="00:54:47.640" style="s2">before your near-fatal boat accident huh</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.609" end="00:54:49.890" style="s2">and we a lot because March 2016 we were</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.640" end="00:54:53.190" style="s2">at this crater that we had hiked up</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.890" end="00:54:58.230" style="s2">looking at this sort of active active</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.190" end="00:55:01.400" style="s2">volcano and Isabella Isabella and there</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.230" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">was one of these smoke pots and I told</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.400" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">the students that they should go down</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:09.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s new land that has emerged from</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:11.339" style="s2">the magma they should go down and claim</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.540" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">it and it would be their fumarole which</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.339" end="00:55:14.609" style="s2">I thought was a terrible joke but what</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">were they gonna do they were on the rim</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.609" end="00:55:21.750" style="s2">of this crater they had nowhere to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:24.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve repeated it here yes well there</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.750" end="00:55:26.220" style="s2">you go there it is you mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.540" end="00:55:27.990" style="s2">racial outreach session as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.220" end="00:55:29.460" style="s2">lower the tensions but then mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.990" end="00:55:31.050" style="s2">that it failed at Evergreen wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.460" end="00:55:34.950" style="s2">fail anywhere because the premise is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.050" end="00:55:39.540" style="s2">lie isn&#39;t this more about feral kids mmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.950" end="00:55:43.470" style="s2">no you know I&#39;m just gonna riff here for</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.540" end="00:55:45.780" style="s2">a second the the fact about addiction</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.470" end="00:55:47.069" style="s2">all right this is not a directly about</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.780" end="00:55:48.420" style="s2">addiction but the fact about addiction</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.069" end="00:55:51.510" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve learned that actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.420" end="00:55:54.210" style="s2">addiction whatever it is emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.510" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">light of boredom and nothing productive</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.210" end="00:56:00.810" style="s2">to do and the people who have productive</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.550" end="00:56:02.670" style="s2">things to do often will avail themselves</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.810" end="00:56:04.650" style="s2">of those opportunities and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.670" end="00:56:08.310" style="s2">something similar is going on here there</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.650" end="00:56:10.829" style="s2">were some baddies a couple in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.310" end="00:56:12.690" style="s2">protests who at Evergreen yeah turn the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.829" end="00:56:14.130" style="s2">world upside down and I&#39;m I have no</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.690" end="00:56:16.020" style="s2">doubt that we are seeing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.130" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">happen on the streets of major American</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.020" end="00:56:18.869" style="s2">cities now where some people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:21.859" style="s2">actually are just itching for a fight</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.869" end="00:56:25.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s what they&#39;re good at are</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.859" end="00:56:27.480" style="s2">creating these conditions but if you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.170" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">I mean for God&#39;s sake look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.480" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">these videos of the moments when the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">protesters and the cops are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:35.520" style="s2">figure out how to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.170" end="00:56:37.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not even frankly the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.520" end="00:56:40.740" style="s2">species right the weird thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.890" end="00:56:43.170" style="s2">learned it occurred to me before the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.740" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">Evergreen crisis that nobody in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.170" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">circle knows any police officers they</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:51.550" style="s2">kind of don&#39;t circulate amongst us</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:53.710" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.550" end="00:56:55.240" style="s2">figure out how they&#39;re just not at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.710" end="00:56:57.790" style="s2">same barbecue so you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.240" end="00:57:00.220" style="s2">mechanism to learn how to talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.790" end="00:57:01.950" style="s2">but the fact is if you if you cross that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.220" end="00:57:05.230" style="s2">bridge which I&#39;ve done many times</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.950" end="00:57:07.630" style="s2">intentionally there is a way and these</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.230" end="00:57:09.370" style="s2">these protestors are discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.630" end="00:57:11.770" style="s2">there are human beings on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.370" end="00:57:13.660" style="s2">and the police are discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.770" end="00:57:18.430" style="s2">these punk kids aren&#39;t necessarily all</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.660" end="00:57:21.430" style="s2">punk kids and something wants to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.430" end="00:57:23.530" style="s2">from that and it gets broken down for</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.430" end="00:57:25.720" style="s2">the stupidest reason which is that any</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.530" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">one person who wants to sabotage it has</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.720" end="00:57:30.550" style="s2">the ability to do so right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:32.590" style="s2">have that but my point is are there</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.550" end="00:57:33.610" style="s2">feral kids yeah there are a few of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.590" end="00:57:36.460" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think they would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.610" end="00:57:38.560" style="s2">dominating this in any way if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.460" end="00:57:40.360" style="s2">coherent framework can you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.560" end="00:57:42.510" style="s2">list of people that we named if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.360" end="00:57:46.900" style="s2">brought them together I mean frankly</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.510" end="00:57:49.570" style="s2">Jonathan mcworter and and Glenn Lowry</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.900" end="00:57:52.180" style="s2">together on the Glenn show like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.570" end="00:57:53.560" style="s2">non-stop fascinating these guys do not</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:55.030" style="s2">agree with each other they don&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.560" end="00:57:56.980" style="s2">from the same perspective they both</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.030" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">regard each other is highly decent and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.980" end="00:58:01.450" style="s2">the conversation reveals things</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:03.460" style="s2">constantly now imagine that you take the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.450" end="00:58:06.130" style="s2">Glenn flow show and you add all of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.460" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">other people to that same stage and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.130" end="00:58:10.270" style="s2">you just put good questions difficult</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:12.280" style="s2">questions on the table people who care</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.270" end="00:58:14.140" style="s2">about this would be fascinated by it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.280" end="00:58:16.030" style="s2">they would be drawn in by the decency of</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.140" end="00:58:18.550" style="s2">the people in the discussion I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.030" end="00:58:20.320" style="s2">think there&#39;s any way it fails I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.550" end="00:58:22.390" style="s2">and what failed at Evergreen was that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.320" end="00:58:24.010" style="s2">evergreen didn&#39;t have the decency or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.390" end="00:58:25.420" style="s2">imagination to let it take place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.010" end="00:58:27.840" style="s2">not like we tried it and it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.420" end="00:58:30.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like they said now that&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.840" end="00:58:32.620" style="s2">guess I I read the question a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.580" end="00:58:34.870" style="s2">differently a racial outreach session</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.620" end="00:58:36.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not what you just described doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.870" end="00:58:38.020" style="s2">sound to me like a racial outreach</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.280" end="00:58:40.510" style="s2">session I think what this person is</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.020" end="00:58:43.780" style="s2">asking is you know get get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.510" end="00:58:46.060" style="s2">the protesters together to to engage</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.780" end="00:58:47.860" style="s2">their their grievances perhaps with</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.060" end="00:58:50.290" style="s2">policemen now this is something that for</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.860" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">instance I think that John Wood jr. has</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.290" end="00:58:56.170" style="s2">been been working on with with better</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:57.340" style="s2">angels and I think there&#39;s an I forget</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.170" end="00:58:58.840" style="s2">now if he&#39;s now with a different</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.340" end="00:59:00.100" style="s2">organization apologies John if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.840" end="00:59:01.240" style="s2">watching or if there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.100" end="00:59:05.530" style="s2">organization that&#39;s also do</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.240" end="00:59:08.470" style="s2">similar work I&#39;m sure there are that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.530" end="00:59:11.590" style="s2">can be effective putting people who in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.470" end="00:59:13.119" style="s2">advance say absolutely I identify as</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.590" end="00:59:17.080" style="s2">being someone who doesn&#39;t like those</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.119" end="00:59:20.050" style="s2">sorts of people and allow them to simmer</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.080" end="00:59:21.670" style="s2">down and just calm down and be together</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.050" end="00:59:25.210" style="s2">listening to each other for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.670" end="00:59:28.660" style="s2">people start to listen yep and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.210" end="00:59:31.030" style="s2">Chloe Valerie one of our favorites</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.660" end="00:59:34.330" style="s2">proposing something I think is quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.030" end="00:59:38.290" style="s2">brilliant if she wants to hold basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.330" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">a boy I think it would be trivializing</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.290" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">him to call it a dance party but a dance</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:43.840" style="s2">gathering in which the music is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:45.360" style="s2">carefully curated and she&#39;d be such the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.840" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">person to do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.360" end="00:59:50.050" style="s2">um now I would say she gave an</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.640" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">abbreviation for the place she was</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.050" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">thinking of doing this and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:55.869" style="s2">tell whether it was indoors or outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:57.610" style="s2">Chloe it needs to be outdoors for viral</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.869" end="01:00:00.040" style="s2">reasons but if you can do it outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.610" end="01:00:02.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a great idea she&#39;s talking in New</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.040" end="01:00:05.890" style="s2">York that&#39;s where she is yep and I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.740" end="01:00:10.210" style="s2">you know it could be contagious in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.890" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">best sense but there&#39;s lots of energy</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.210" end="01:00:16.270" style="s2">and creativity this again the irony is</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:19.210" style="s2">this is the deepest bench we have we</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.270" end="01:00:21.430" style="s2">have brilliant creative fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.210" end="01:00:24.460" style="s2">highly decent people and we have a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.430" end="01:00:29.109" style="s2">of them on this topic so what the hell</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.460" end="01:00:30.520" style="s2">are we doing next question thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.109" end="01:00:32.080" style="s2">doing this podcast would you two be</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.520" end="01:00:34.119" style="s2">willing to take psychedelic mushrooms</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.080" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris for</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.119" end="01:00:41.980" style="s2">the good of humanity yeah I&#39;d be willing</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:47.590" style="s2">to do that for the good of us yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.980" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">mean sure sure I have a feeling Sam and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.590" end="01:00:53.980" style="s2">I would end up yeah even a difficult</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:55.540" style="s2">conversation I can I could have fun</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.980" end="01:00:59.020" style="s2">talking to each other while you and Sam</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.540" end="01:01:00.609" style="s2">did whatever you were it might become a</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.020" end="01:01:03.490" style="s2">problem for each other but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.609" end="01:01:06.369" style="s2">you might yeah yeah but anyway yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.490" end="01:01:10.359" style="s2">sure you&#39;d approach friends oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.369" end="01:01:14.339" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I mean you know all jokes</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.359" end="01:01:18.920" style="s2">aside magic mushrooms are fun</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.339" end="01:01:21.390" style="s2">but they&#39;re also an amazing tool for</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.920" end="01:01:24.299" style="s2">mind broadening you know there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.390" end="01:01:26.609" style="s2">mystical about that and they basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.299" end="01:01:29.579" style="s2">break normal thought patterns without so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.609" end="01:01:31.799" style="s2">thoroughly disrupting thinking that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.579" end="01:01:33.930" style="s2">you can&#39;t be productive at it so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.799" end="01:01:36.420" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an important tool and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.930" end="01:01:41.219" style="s2">whatever the context was for the good of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.420" end="01:01:43.259" style="s2">humanity sure yeah are either of you</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.219" end="01:01:45.390" style="s2">aware of Gilbert Lang&#39;s association</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.259" end="01:01:46.949" style="s2">induction hypothesis what is our chance</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.390" end="01:01:49.439" style="s2">to solving this pandemic if our</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.949" end="01:01:52.499" style="s2">fundamental bilayer pump cell theory has</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.439" end="01:01:53.999" style="s2">been experimentally disproven I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.499" end="01:01:55.170" style="s2">that&#39;s two different questions but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.999" end="01:01:57.359" style="s2">honestly don&#39;t know enough about either</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.170" end="01:02:02.459" style="s2">of them to be totally sure yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.359" end="01:02:04.859" style="s2">look I love a good deeply heterodox</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.459" end="01:02:07.519" style="s2">hypothesis in biology and a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.859" end="01:02:09.869" style="s2">I mean most of them are wrong but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.519" end="01:02:11.309" style="s2">frequency with which we see something</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.869" end="01:02:13.829" style="s2">fundamental about what we believe</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.309" end="01:02:16.410" style="s2">severely disrupted by what we then learn</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.829" end="01:02:17.729" style="s2">is pretty high and so I don&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.410" end="01:02:20.459" style="s2">one particular but you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.729" end="01:02:21.959" style="s2">the bilayer pump cell theory now not the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.459" end="01:02:23.099" style="s2">Gilbert links Association induction</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.959" end="01:02:24.689" style="s2">hypothesis or do you think it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.099" end="01:02:28.559" style="s2">thing I wish I knew</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.689" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">yeah but you know I will say as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.559" end="01:02:33.509" style="s2">talked about before we have a problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.920" end="01:02:35.309" style="s2">where there&#39;s certain things that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.509" end="01:02:36.479" style="s2">can diagram very well and there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.309" end="01:02:39.089" style="s2">certain things that are impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.479" end="01:02:41.549" style="s2">diagram and so are you thinking like you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.089" end="01:02:43.979" style="s2">call up the image of the of the bilayer</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.549" end="01:02:45.569" style="s2">pop at the cell membrane right everyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.979" end="01:02:47.759" style="s2">can who&#39;s too spent any time with those</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.569" end="01:02:49.769" style="s2">textbooks right I mean look even just</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.759" end="01:02:52.469" style="s2">the definition of enzyme right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.769" end="01:02:54.749" style="s2">right enzyme is a catalyst really I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.469" end="01:02:56.429" style="s2">yes technically sure but really no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.749" end="01:02:59.939" style="s2">a goddamn machine is what it is right</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.429" end="01:03:03.140" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s like a factory but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.939" end="01:03:05.910" style="s2">thing is those of us who grew up with</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.140" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">diagrams of an enzyme as a static entity</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.910" end="01:03:10.619" style="s2">that you know took a triangle like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:12.329" style="s2">object and a square like object and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.619" end="01:03:14.249" style="s2">oriented them in such a way that they</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.329" end="01:03:16.289" style="s2">clump together so the two sides fit</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.249" end="01:03:18.630" style="s2">those of us who had that thing have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.289" end="01:03:20.670" style="s2">kind of dim view of what an enzyme</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.630" end="01:03:23.099" style="s2">really is and those of us who had the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.670" end="01:03:25.670" style="s2">animation in which you know the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.099" end="01:03:30.020" style="s2">replication complex is taking</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.670" end="01:03:31.430" style="s2">units and you know like that thing we</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.020" end="01:03:33.349" style="s2">have a much better sense of what it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.430" end="01:03:35.569" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s a lot of places</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.349" end="01:03:38.180" style="s2">where every biologist on earth is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.569" end="01:03:41.299" style="s2">synchronized into dim-witted thinking by</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.180" end="01:03:42.980" style="s2">some bad drawing that caught on and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.299" end="01:03:44.839" style="s2">sooner we free ourselves from those</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.980" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">things the better off we&#39;ll be there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.839" end="01:03:48.380" style="s2">some really good animations to that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:49.849" style="s2">have pointed me to and that you then</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.380" end="01:03:52.730" style="s2">used when you were teaching intro bio</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.849" end="01:03:54.200" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure you know just even absent</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.730" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">everything else that you did just</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.200" end="01:03:59.420" style="s2">handing the students those tools the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:01.910" style="s2">animation tools of the the tools of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.420" end="01:04:03.710" style="s2">molecular biology animated in the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.910" end="01:04:07.549" style="s2">that we currently imagined it to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.710" end="01:04:09.319" style="s2">operating is staggering I mean just even</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.549" end="01:04:11.150" style="s2">the one we could probably show it at</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.319" end="01:04:14.500" style="s2">some point but the one of the motor</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.150" end="01:04:16.930" style="s2">protein marching the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.500" end="01:04:20.950" style="s2">neurotransmitters down the axon of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.930" end="01:04:24.140" style="s2">of the neuron right like yeah I mean a</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.950" end="01:04:26.750" style="s2">you have to look it&#39;s adorable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.140" end="01:04:28.970" style="s2">amazing right it&#39;s just it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.750" end="01:04:30.410" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s fits so well with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.970" end="01:04:31.819" style="s2">mushroom question too because once</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.410" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen that that&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.819" end="01:04:38.900" style="s2">in your cells it just a whole different</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:40.490" style="s2">universe right okay let&#39;s answer one</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.900" end="01:04:42.049" style="s2">more question and then apologies as</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.490" end="01:04:43.430" style="s2">always for not getting to all of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.049" end="01:04:48.230" style="s2">questions so many of which are really</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.430" end="01:04:50.000" style="s2">really high-quality Linda asks when</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.230" end="01:04:51.079" style="s2">asked about meditation you responded</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.000" end="01:04:52.790" style="s2">that you do not formally meditate</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.079" end="01:04:53.990" style="s2">yourself but that you embark on doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.790" end="01:04:56.030" style="s2">things that produce some analogous</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.990" end="01:04:59.049" style="s2">effects could you and Heather elaborate</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.030" end="01:05:04.099" style="s2">and what some of these things are may I</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.049" end="01:05:06.770" style="s2">start by saying that I did I was lucky</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.099" end="01:05:09.530" style="s2">enough to be invited as a senior in high</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.770" end="01:05:12.020" style="s2">school to participate in a what was</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.530" end="01:05:15.260" style="s2">called a Buddhist artists retreat and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.020" end="01:05:17.329" style="s2">was sort of in 1987 that was led by tech</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.260" end="01:05:19.940" style="s2">not Han who was then not very well known</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.329" end="01:05:26.420" style="s2">but who was has now become fairly well</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.940" end="01:05:30.260" style="s2">known as a as a Buddhist expat of Tibet</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.420" end="01:05:32.230" style="s2">and I was there it was in it was an oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.260" end="01:05:36.020" style="s2">hi in California at the Ojai Foundation</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.230" end="01:05:38.030" style="s2">with a lot of Beat poets and various</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.020" end="01:05:40.760" style="s2">other artists and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.030" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">took not hon led us in three sitting and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.760" end="01:05:47.030" style="s2">one walking meditation everyday and</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:49.910" style="s2">other times we you know we cooked and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.030" end="01:05:51.559" style="s2">kept the place clean and we wandered the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.910" end="01:05:54.680" style="s2">natural lands and we did whatever our</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.559" end="01:05:57.109" style="s2">art was which for me was writing and</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.680" end="01:05:59.569" style="s2">also I was doing some 2d and beginning</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.109" end="01:06:01.040" style="s2">to do a little bit of ceramics and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.569" end="01:06:03.650" style="s2">will say that while I did not keep up</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.040" end="01:06:06.589" style="s2">the tradition of meditating much beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.650" end="01:06:09.140" style="s2">those two two and a half weeks or so</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.589" end="01:06:11.630" style="s2">that that I was there with that amazing</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.140" end="01:06:13.210" style="s2">group of people you know decades younger</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.630" end="01:06:17.359" style="s2">than anyone else who was in attendance</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.210" end="01:06:19.819" style="s2">that many pieces of it are exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:24.280" style="s2">I go to write the the being in nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.819" end="01:06:26.900" style="s2">being alone walking in solitude writing</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.280" end="01:06:30.290" style="s2">finding finding the truth and beauty in</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.900" end="01:06:33.349" style="s2">art and in creation and then also in</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.290" end="01:06:35.420" style="s2">reference to the earlier questions there</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.349" end="01:06:36.020" style="s2">is value in hallucinogens than</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.420" end="01:06:42.640" style="s2">entheogens</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.020" end="01:06:44.420" style="s2">as well yeah so I I play Mario Kart</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.640" end="01:06:45.559" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t even know what Mario</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.420" end="01:06:49.040" style="s2">Kart is but I know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.559" end="01:06:51.579" style="s2">something called that so I don&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.040" end="01:06:53.599" style="s2">all back I don&#39;t find your jokes funny</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.579" end="01:06:55.819" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.599" end="01:06:57.650" style="s2">no you know actually this is an</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.819" end="01:07:01.010" style="s2">interesting one I think I do a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.650" end="01:07:04.010" style="s2">stuff that puts me in this frame of mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.010" end="01:07:06.589" style="s2">it&#39;s not of one type the thing I miss</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.010" end="01:07:08.180" style="s2">our old house the one we were forced to</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.589" end="01:07:09.589" style="s2">move from when we came to Portland and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.180" end="01:07:13.790" style="s2">in general I&#39;m very glad that we moved</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.589" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">to Portland but we had a second building</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.790" end="01:07:19.180" style="s2">in which we had put in a basically a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:25.240" style="s2">tinkering space in a pottery studio and</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.180" end="01:07:28.280" style="s2">tinkering for me is so it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.240" end="01:07:31.309" style="s2">meditative it has that component but it</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.280" end="01:07:34.040" style="s2">also just sort of trains the mind kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.309" end="01:07:36.230" style="s2">of thing yeah and I miss it in our place</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.040" end="01:07:37.730" style="s2">here well it has that potential we just</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.230" end="01:07:39.260" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten there yet and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.730" end="01:07:40.369" style="s2">I&#39;m suffering a little bit from its</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.260" end="01:07:43.069" style="s2">absence and I&#39;m probably getting</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.369" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">stupider which I would like to stop</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.069" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">doing soon there&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:50.300" style="s2">both of us seek and have sought and have</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:52.580" style="s2">inspired and our children is</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.300" end="01:07:54.560" style="s2">well I have short-handed it to speed</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.580" end="01:07:56.570" style="s2">that I just love the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.560" end="01:07:59.960" style="s2">physical speed and we find it on bikes</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.570" end="01:08:02.390" style="s2">and you this year just barely began to</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.960" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">introduce our children to it on skis and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.390" end="01:08:06.350" style="s2">then the lockdown happened and I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:10.700" style="s2">you got out with him twice and I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.350" end="01:08:14.290" style="s2">yet gotten out with with you you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.700" end="01:08:19.490" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly it&#39;s mostly bikes for us but</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.290" end="01:08:24.160" style="s2">any ability to go really fast under your</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.490" end="01:08:26.780" style="s2">own power is ecstatic in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.160" end="01:08:28.490" style="s2">produces some of the same effects to use</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.780" end="01:08:31.190" style="s2">some sort of Jamie wheels languaging</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.490" end="01:08:33.859" style="s2">around seeking X tasks rather than</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.190" end="01:08:36.920" style="s2">catharsis through you know some people</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.859" end="01:08:39.530" style="s2">get it through meditation solitude quiet</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.920" end="01:08:42.020" style="s2">depths and some people through you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.530" end="01:08:44.690" style="s2">extreme sports and you know there&#39;s room</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.020" end="01:08:46.609" style="s2">to be had for experiencing this getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.690" end="01:08:49.930" style="s2">the kind of meditative effects in both</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.609" end="01:08:52.670" style="s2">ways usually not simultaneously yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.930" end="01:08:55.670" style="s2">would also add this woman I feel a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.670" end="01:08:57.770" style="s2">little weird about but I&#39;m love the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.670" end="01:08:59.420" style="s2">bicycles I&#39;m a huge fan and I like</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.770" end="01:09:01.549" style="s2">skiing quite a bit and it was cool to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.420" end="01:09:04.730" style="s2">get back to it but there&#39;s this other</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.549" end="01:09:06.109" style="s2">thing that we have started to do which</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.730" end="01:09:08.540" style="s2">has a terrible name and it needs a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.109" end="01:09:10.790" style="s2">better one but electric unicycle an</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.540" end="01:09:12.319" style="s2">electric unicycle is not honest in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.790" end="01:09:13.850" style="s2">same way that a bicycle is you know I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.319" end="01:09:15.740" style="s2">bicycle you put in every bit of energy</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.850" end="01:09:18.230" style="s2">to climb the hill and then you get the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.740" end="01:09:19.700" style="s2">reward going down the electric unicycle</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.230" end="01:09:23.240" style="s2">is something you plug in it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.700" end="01:09:25.819" style="s2">battery one wheel in a little case and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.240" end="01:09:27.830" style="s2">two pedals that you stand on but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.819" end="01:09:29.240" style="s2">little bit like you know you don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.830" end="01:09:30.859" style="s2">in the energy to go sailing</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.240" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">all right the energy comes from the wind</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.859" end="01:09:35.720" style="s2">but you take advantage of the energy and</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:38.270" style="s2">it&#39;s very natural and in some ways as</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.720" end="01:09:40.609" style="s2">synthetic is electric unicycle is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.270" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">very quiet it&#39;s very natural and you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.609" end="01:09:45.859" style="s2">whizz through the night if you want my</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:47.900" style="s2">kids and I broke curfew the other night</p>

<p begin="01:09:50.810" end="01:09:57.140" style="s2">authority problem I guess but so let me</p>
