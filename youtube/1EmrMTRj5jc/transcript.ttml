<p begin="00:01:15.580" end="00:01:20.619" style="s2">temperament well the first thing you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.700" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">obviously that you have to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.619" end="00:01:24.100" style="s2">understand your temperament to some</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:27.940" style="s2">degree and so the best way to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.100" end="00:01:29.530" style="s2">that is to get yourself assessed using a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.940" end="00:01:31.540" style="s2">good big five instrument there&#39;s many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.530" end="00:01:33.159" style="s2">them online we&#39;re going to be setting up</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.540" end="00:01:37.869" style="s2">a website within the next month that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.159" end="00:01:40.540" style="s2">will enable people to do use a tool that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.869" end="00:01:41.890" style="s2">a student of mine call Andy young who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.540" end="00:01:43.960" style="s2">now a professor at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.890" end="00:01:46.270" style="s2">Minnesota and I and some other</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.960" end="00:01:48.580" style="s2">co-authors developed back in in I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.270" end="00:01:50.140" style="s2">it was 2007 called the big five aspect</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.580" end="00:01:52.060" style="s2">scale and it breaks the big five down</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.140" end="00:01:54.280" style="s2">into ten aspects and we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.060" end="00:01:55.990" style="s2">version of that online I hope by the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.280" end="00:01:59.679" style="s2">of July that&#39;s the plan that will enable</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.990" end="00:02:01.509" style="s2">people to get a read of their</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.679" end="00:02:03.700" style="s2">temperament that will tell them how</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.509" end="00:02:05.649" style="s2">extroverted they are how high they are a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.700" end="00:02:07.690" style="s2">negative emotion or neuroticism how</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.649" end="00:02:09.610" style="s2">agreeable how conscientious and how open</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.690" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">but it&#39;ll break each of those traits</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.610" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">down into two aspects so extraversion</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:17.549" style="s2">breaks into enthusiasm and assertiveness</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:20.500" style="s2">neuroticism breaks into withdrawal and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.549" end="00:02:22.019" style="s2">volatility agreeableness breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.500" end="00:02:24.070" style="s2">into politeness and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.019" end="00:02:26.410" style="s2">conscientiousness into orderliness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.070" end="00:02:27.459" style="s2">industrious and openness into openness</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.410" end="00:02:30.070" style="s2">proper which is something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.459" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">creativity and interest in ideas and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.070" end="00:02:33.970" style="s2">the first thing you have to know is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:35.470" style="s2">your temperament is the second thing you</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.970" end="00:02:37.510" style="s2">should probably know and we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.470" end="00:02:39.459" style="s2">add this functionality to the system at</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.510" end="00:02:42.519" style="s2">some point is what your intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.459" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">level is what your IQ is because the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.519" end="00:02:48.100" style="s2">higher your IQ the better suited you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">for jobs whose demands change rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.100" end="00:02:53.410" style="s2">and most so those are complex jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:55.660" style="s2">simple jobs are the jobs where you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:57.070" style="s2">learn something and then you can run it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.660" end="00:02:58.750" style="s2">as an algorithm you can just repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.070" end="00:03:02.290" style="s2">over and over and those jobs of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.750" end="00:03:04.450" style="s2">are becoming more and more scarce so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.290" end="00:03:05.560" style="s2">need to know what your temperament is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.450" end="00:03:07.900" style="s2">and then you need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.560" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">temperamental demands of the job</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.900" end="00:03:13.269" style="s2">now most jobs are mastered with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">combination of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.269" end="00:03:19.420" style="s2">conscientiousness but the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">temperamental factors play a moderating</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.420" end="00:03:25.600" style="s2">role so for example extroverted people</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:26.560" style="s2">tend to be entertainer types and highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:28.989" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.560" end="00:03:31.900" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re interested for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.989" end="00:03:33.160" style="s2">in if you&#39;re extroverted then a career</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.900" end="00:03:35.020" style="s2">in sales is something that you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.160" end="00:03:36.730" style="s2">consider a career that involves a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.020" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">public communication and interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.730" end="00:03:39.340" style="s2">with groups whereas you&#39;re an introvert</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:42.340" style="s2">you&#39;re going to work you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.340" end="00:03:45.400" style="s2">want to work a lot more you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.340" end="00:03:47.830" style="s2">be suited to work honest in a solitary</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.400" end="00:03:50.140" style="s2">manner a lot more if you&#39;re agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.830" end="00:03:51.849" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be suited for taking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.140" end="00:03:55.390" style="s2">care of people if you&#39;re disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.849" end="00:03:58.360" style="s2">then you&#39;re a tough bargainer and a hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.390" end="00:04:01.209" style="s2">ago she ater and and litigators for</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.360" end="00:04:04.780" style="s2">example lawyers are often low in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.209" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2">agreeableness so if you&#39;re conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.780" end="00:04:08.170" style="s2">well that tends to be a very good trait</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.940" end="00:04:11.049" style="s2">for any kind of managerial and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.170" end="00:04:13.450" style="s2">administrative job and for for for</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.049" end="00:04:15.010" style="s2">simpler jobs as well it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.450" end="00:04:19.090" style="s2">predictor of military prowess for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.010" end="00:04:20.680" style="s2">example if you&#39;re high in openness then</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.090" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna want a creative career and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.680" end="00:04:24.850" style="s2">that might make you an entrepreneur or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:27.070" style="s2">musician or an artist about or something</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">like that that&#39;s often very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.070" end="00:04:31.510" style="s2">difficult to monetize but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:32.919" style="s2">funny things about openness is that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.510" end="00:04:34.900" style="s2">you&#39;re high in openness it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.919" end="00:04:37.030" style="s2">helpful at the bottom of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.900" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">because you&#39;re basically expected at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.030" end="00:04:41.080" style="s2">bottom of most hierarchies to act more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:42.669" style="s2">or less like a functionary but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.080" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">becomes of critical importance at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.669" end="00:04:46.570" style="s2">top of hierarchy so it&#39;s a personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.340" style="s2">trait whose utility can really kick in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.570" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">in the later stages of your career</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.340" end="00:04:53.140" style="s2">because in really complex positions</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:54.700" style="s2">where things are changing dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.140" end="00:04:57.789" style="s2">you need to have a high intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.700" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">you also need to be creative so how can</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.789" end="00:05:00.669" style="s2">you determine if a job is a good fit or</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">a terrible mistake</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.669" end="00:05:06.610" style="s2">ha well I would say you can tell if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:09.700" style="s2">a terrible mistake if you dread going</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:11.410" style="s2">and also if you&#39;re working hard and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.700" end="00:05:13.270" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re supposed to and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.410" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">not being rewarded for it or and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.270" end="00:05:22.410" style="s2">no chance for advancement so that those</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.460" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">are good reasons to to leave so alright</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.410" end="00:05:26.590" style="s2">truck plain says just wanted to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:28.690" style="s2">that you&#39;re the first person to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.590" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">make me read books I have a background</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.690" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">in math and engineering lots of formulas</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:33.820" style="s2">and equations keep up your work well</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">good work truck playing there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.820" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">real utility in reading books and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">glad that you found the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:42.139" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that you figured out why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">necessary to do that so that&#39;s that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.139" end="00:05:48.229" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m very happy to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:49.669" style="s2">Oliver Connor says it&#39;s definitely worth</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.229" end="00:05:51.530" style="s2">doing the humanities it gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.669" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">skill set you can apply anywhere that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.530" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">actually worth elaborating on a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.090" end="00:05:57.860" style="s2">bit because I do believe that classical</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.440" style="s2">humanities education is at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.860" end="00:06:02.780" style="s2">the proper university curriculum and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.440" end="00:06:04.190" style="s2">might say well what&#39;s the utility for</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.780" end="00:06:05.570" style="s2">example in studying philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.190" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">literature but that&#39;s not exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.570" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">right way to look at it the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:14.030" style="s2">humanities education at least in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">principle is that it teaches you first</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.030" end="00:06:17.810" style="s2">of all how to be civilized and educated</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:20.120" style="s2">so that you become aware of the major</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.810" end="00:06:22.520" style="s2">cultural works that every educated</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.120" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">person needs to be aware of in order to</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.669" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">positions almost always involves the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.270" end="00:06:53.180" style="s2">identification of problems and their</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:55.430" style="s2">articulations so that you can frame the</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.430" end="00:06:59.419" style="s2">potential set of solutions and then the</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.990" end="00:07:31.070" style="s2">what that means yeah I can I can</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">means well look at at a lower stage of</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.960" end="00:07:49.010" style="s2">game you&#39;re going to determine morality</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:07:57.979" style="s2">that you start to understand that well</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.389" end="00:08:01.880" style="s2">the rules were actually a human creation</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.979" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">in in their original form and that what</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.880" end="00:08:06.199" style="s2">that means is that when it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:08.030" style="s2">the rules can be adjusted think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.199" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">the Harry Potter series I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.030" end="00:08:12.889" style="s2">the things that characterizes Harry and</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.889" end="00:08:17.060" style="s2">is a really good example of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.539" end="00:08:18.710" style="s2">they&#39;re sufficiently disciplined I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.060" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">she happens to be really disciplined and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.710" end="00:08:24.740" style="s2">are perfectly capable of following the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.419" style="s2">rules but also make exceptions when</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.740" end="00:08:28.340" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary and it&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.419" end="00:08:29.960" style="s2">they can step beyond the rules when that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.340" end="00:08:32.419" style="s2">becomes necessary that actually makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.960" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">them the heroes of the adventure because</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.419" end="00:08:37.159" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:39.050" style="s2">situation where you can always act</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.159" end="00:08:40.789" style="s2">perfectly only by following the rules</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.050" end="00:08:42.529" style="s2">because it&#39;s very difficult to delineate</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.789" end="00:08:44.120" style="s2">out a rule set that&#39;s sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.529" end="00:08:47.270" style="s2">comprehensive so it&#39;ll cover every</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.120" end="00:08:50.690" style="s2">eventuality so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.270" end="00:08:53.180" style="s2">upshot on that women have a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.690" end="00:08:55.220" style="s2">prefer bad men higher in dark triad</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:56.870" style="s2">traits how come the Bible describes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.220" end="00:08:58.940" style="s2">mode of being as associated with nice</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.870" end="00:09:01.730" style="s2">guy traits which contradict that okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.940" end="00:09:03.649" style="s2">well I take issue with both elements of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.730" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">that actually I don&#39;t believe that women</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.649" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">do have a tendency to prefer bad men</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:12.339" style="s2">higher in dark triad traits they may</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">have a tendency to be more erratically</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.339" end="00:09:18.380" style="s2">attracted to men who are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">manifesting dominance and aggression I</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.380" end="00:09:22.040" style="s2">think the evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">relatively clear and I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.040" end="00:09:26.120" style="s2">Bible at all just describes a mode of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:30.410" style="s2">being as associated with nice guy traits</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.120" end="00:09:33.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that may be how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.410" end="00:09:36.589" style="s2">classically taught for example because</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.130" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">Christ is often presented especially and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.589" end="00:09:40.660" style="s2">more simple-minded</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">vary variants and I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.660" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">pejorative about that precisely as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:47.510" style="s2">ultimate in nice guys but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">that that&#39;s true at all that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.510" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">reasonable characterization at all if</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:53.690" style="s2">you read the Gospel accounts because he</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">was someone who was certainly capable of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.690" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">saying very very harsh things to people</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">and was also identified very strongly as</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.279" end="00:10:02.510" style="s2">a figure who was capable of using</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.170" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">judgment and distinguishing between what</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.510" end="00:10:06.110" style="s2">was positive and what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.630" end="00:10:08.790" style="s2">and that capacity for judgment is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.110" end="00:10:11.010" style="s2">something quite different than then then</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.790" end="00:10:12.510" style="s2">the mere nice-guy compassion that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.010" end="00:10:16.680" style="s2">be associated with high levels of trade</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.510" end="00:10:19.500" style="s2">agreeableness so I think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">idea that the ideal that&#39;s put forward</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.500" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">in the biblical writings is something</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">like be harmless I think that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">miss reading of the text and I also</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.570" style="s2">think that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:33.660" style="s2">harmless and good are not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.570" end="00:10:35.520" style="s2">at all in fact I think one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.660" end="00:10:37.320" style="s2">ways of characterizing like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.520" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">higher-order morality and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.320" end="00:10:41.940" style="s2">something that Nietzsche talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:43.590" style="s2">fair bit is that and Jung as well with</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.940" end="00:10:46.500" style="s2">regards to the idea of integration of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.590" end="00:10:48.930" style="s2">the shadow is that someone whose morale</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.500" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">has the capability for violence and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.930" end="00:10:52.860" style="s2">capability for aggression built in and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:54.990" style="s2">at hand but is also someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.860" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">perfectly capable of controlling that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.990" end="00:10:58.920" style="s2">the civilized manner</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.630" style="s2">and I think that you know I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.920" end="00:11:05.280" style="s2">off-the-cuff here obviously but I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.630" end="00:11:08.400" style="s2">that the the the attraction that some</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.280" end="00:11:11.460" style="s2">women have for the for the sort of men</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.400" end="00:11:14.330" style="s2">who are more likely to misbehave to act</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.460" end="00:11:18.360" style="s2">in a delinquent manner and so forth is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.330" end="00:11:19.860" style="s2">partly their desire to be associated</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.360" end="00:11:22.260" style="s2">with men who have the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.860" end="00:11:24.450" style="s2">aggression now the best of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.260" end="00:11:26.580" style="s2">worlds is when that capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.450" end="00:11:29.640" style="s2">aggression is civilized and held under</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.580" end="00:11:32.010" style="s2">control but so I would say that one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.640" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">the things that men should do as they</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.010" end="00:11:36.960" style="s2">mature is transform themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:39.150" style="s2">monsters but also become civilized at</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.960" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">the same time and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:44.310" style="s2">you see in stories like Beauty and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">Beast where the the the ideal man starts</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.310" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">out as a beast and ends up civilized he</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t start out as a milksop wimp sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:53.490" style="s2">of character who you know who poses no</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:54.930" style="s2">threat to anyone and then becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:56.430" style="s2">hero that isn&#39;t how it works although</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.930" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">there are stories of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.430" end="00:12:03.210" style="s2">development so which is the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">accessible of Carl Jung&#39;s books oh well</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.210" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say any of them are</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:08.220" style="s2">particularly accessible although modern</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:09.930" style="s2">man in search of the soul is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.220" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">good one to start with that&#39;s modern</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.930" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">managed search of a soul I think modern</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:18.840" style="s2">man in search of his soul anyways</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:20.550" style="s2">it&#39;s modern man in search of a soul I</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.840" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">believe it&#39;s short and it&#39;s to the point</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.550" end="00:12:25.050" style="s2">and and so that&#39;s a good introduction</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">which has been the most impactful to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.050" end="00:12:33.060" style="s2">probably I on a IOM which is the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">volume the second volume of vol 9 of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.060" end="00:12:37.920" style="s2">collected works which is an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.620" end="00:12:40.980" style="s2">amazing terrifying book which describes</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.920" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">it actually it actually it contains some</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.980" end="00:12:44.430" style="s2">of Young&#39;s writings on the psychology of</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.430" end="00:12:49.490" style="s2">interesting because he regarded</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.630" end="00:12:52.590" style="s2">astrology as a millennia long as</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.600" end="00:12:59.010" style="s2">and spent a lot of time in analyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.090" end="00:13:00.510" style="s2">content of that you might think about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.010" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">as a dream that was projected out into</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.510" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">the cosmos so what are your personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">strategies for consuming the news hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:11.970" style="s2">well you know it&#39;s funny for years I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t launched television news for</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.970" end="00:13:14.370" style="s2">example and I don&#39;t read newspapers very</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.330" style="s2">often either</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.370" end="00:13:20.250" style="s2">I actually limit my exposure to the news</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.330" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">I read The Economist I used to read</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.250" end="00:13:26.820" style="s2">Harper&#39;s Magazine I used to read The</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">Atlantic Monthly as well I thought they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.820" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">were good periodicals although I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">both of them have collapsed quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:35.400" style="s2">precipitously in recent years Harper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">maybe not so much how do I walk the line</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.400" end="00:13:38.490" style="s2">between wanting to be informed while</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">avoiding the danger of cluttering your</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.490" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">mind well The Economist helps with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.490" style="s2">I think it&#39;s actually going downhill to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:46.530" style="s2">some degree over recent years as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.490" end="00:13:48.270" style="s2">but I definitely tell my clinical</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.530" end="00:13:49.350" style="s2">clients very frequently especially if</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.270" end="00:13:51.270" style="s2">they&#39;re depressed and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.350" end="00:13:55.080" style="s2">overwhelmed just to limit their exposure</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.270" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">to to daily news particularly because if</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.080" end="00:13:58.140" style="s2">something is only relevant the day that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:13:59.850" style="s2">it&#39;s published you could make the case</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.140" end="00:14:00.900" style="s2">that it&#39;s not relevant at all which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.850" end="00:14:02.400" style="s2">part of the reason why I like The</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.900" end="00:14:04.230" style="s2">Economist because it only comes out</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.400" end="00:14:06.600" style="s2">every week ER or two weeks depending on</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.230" end="00:14:08.370" style="s2">your subscription and so it can only</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.600" end="00:14:10.650" style="s2">cover things that have enough importance</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.370" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">to to be relevant over a timeframe that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.650" end="00:14:15.540" style="s2">exceeds a day so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:20.730" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve got in</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.540" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">the live stream here how do we revive</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.730" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">interest in the good mother archetype</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:30.150" style="s2">well that&#39;s a good question I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:33.420" style="s2">a good question in part because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.150" end="00:14:35.490" style="s2">really obvious to me that young women on</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.420" end="00:14:37.230" style="s2">their society are told the truth about</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.490" end="00:14:41.250" style="s2">what their lives are likely to be like</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.230" end="00:14:45.200" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.250" end="00:14:48.750" style="s2">taught both explicitly and implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.200" end="00:14:52.010" style="s2">that their primary interest will be in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:54.270" style="s2">the pursuit of a dynamic career and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.010" end="00:14:57.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some real problems with that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.270" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">first is that the proportion of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.480" end="00:15:02.520" style="s2">who will have a dynamic career in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">technical sense is actually quite low</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.520" end="00:15:08.220" style="s2">because most people have jobs and not</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:11.280" style="s2">careers and even in those jobs that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.220" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">might be regarded as careers much of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.280" end="00:15:16.140" style="s2">work that&#39;s done is job like I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">reason that people pay you to have a job</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.140" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">is often because you&#39;re required to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:25.410" style="s2">things that you wouldn&#39;t do if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:29.730" style="s2">weren&#39;t being paid and so we we</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.410" end="00:15:32.730" style="s2">glamorize the role of career and confuse</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.730" end="00:15:34.470" style="s2">jobs with careers and assume that most</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.730" end="00:15:36.140" style="s2">people are going to end up with high end</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.470" end="00:15:40.020" style="s2">careers and then we also assume that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.140" end="00:15:42.600" style="s2">most people even those who are qualified</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.020" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">to have high end careers are actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.600" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">the sort of people who would like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:48.570" style="s2">have high end careers if they could and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:50.550" style="s2">that&#39;s also often not true so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.570" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">example I&#39;ve worked very intensely with</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.550" end="00:15:56.490" style="s2">a large population of female lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.860" end="00:15:59.220" style="s2">usually see usually partners at large</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.490" end="00:16:01.589" style="s2">law firms very very successful women</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.220" end="00:16:04.980" style="s2">usually very attractive very intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.589" end="00:16:07.589" style="s2">extraordinarily conscientious and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.980" end="00:16:09.210" style="s2">sort of people who were outstanding in</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.589" end="00:16:11.130" style="s2">high school and then outstanding as</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.210" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">undergraduates and then aced law school</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.130" end="00:16:15.630" style="s2">and then did their articling perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.520" style="s2">and then became associates and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.630" end="00:16:18.839" style="s2">eventually entered the partner stream in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.520" end="00:16:21.870" style="s2">a large law firm and then became</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.839" end="00:16:24.390" style="s2">partners and a huge proportion of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.870" end="00:16:26.970" style="s2">wake up around 30 somewhere between 30</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.390" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">and 32 and notice they&#39;re 65 our day</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.970" end="00:16:30.120" style="s2">and the incredibly competitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:32.459" style="s2">environment that they happen to be in</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.120" end="00:16:34.319" style="s2">and the fact that the demands of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.459" end="00:16:35.639" style="s2">career are only going to accelerate as</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.319" end="00:16:37.439" style="s2">they move forward I mean they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.639" end="00:16:39.720" style="s2">to make a lot of money but the demands</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.439" end="00:16:41.899" style="s2">on their time of their career only going</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.720" end="00:16:45.029" style="s2">to accelerate as they move forward and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.899" end="00:16:47.069" style="s2">decide quite rapidly that that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.029" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">not what they want and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.069" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">that is they also would like to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:51.810" style="s2">life they&#39;d like to have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">that they could attend to and they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.810" end="00:16:56.069" style="s2">like to have children and the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:16:59.189" style="s2">the simple truth of the matter is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.069" end="00:17:01.500" style="s2">that it&#39;s very very difficult to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.189" end="00:17:03.209" style="s2">truly high end career and have an</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.500" end="00:17:04.980" style="s2">important relationship and have children</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.209" end="00:17:06.419" style="s2">especially if there are two of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.980" end="00:17:09.150" style="s2">trying to pursue that at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.419" end="00:17:10.620" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult and it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.150" end="00:17:12.600" style="s2">to have a high end career period and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.620" end="00:17:14.669" style="s2">it&#39;s also difficult to have a fully</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.600" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">functional family trying to combine</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.669" end="00:17:18.900" style="s2">those sorts of things makes people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:20.909" style="s2">are I mean I&#39;ve seen people do it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.900" end="00:17:22.740" style="s2">man they they push themselves right to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.909" end="00:17:25.110" style="s2">their limits and they usually have</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.740" end="00:17:27.720" style="s2">limits that exceed the limits of typical</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.110" end="00:17:30.299" style="s2">people so one of the things we can do</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.720" end="00:17:32.520" style="s2">for example to revive interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.299" end="00:17:33.990" style="s2">good mother archetype is to stop telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.520" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">lies to young women about what their</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.990" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">life is likely to be like because my</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.669" style="s2">experience has been and you might think</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:41.370" style="s2">I&#39;m old-fashioned although I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.669" end="00:17:42.929" style="s2">really think I am by the way I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.370" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">actually quite current and I pay a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.929" end="00:17:46.370" style="s2">of attention to what&#39;s going on around</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:50.419" style="s2">me and my experience has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.370" end="00:17:53.190" style="s2">overwhelmingly that high-caliber women</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.419" end="00:17:54.900" style="s2">decide in their 30s that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.190" end="00:17:56.789" style="s2">and family is the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">in their life and I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.789" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">that the fact that major law firms for</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.059" style="s2">example have a really difficult time</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.650" end="00:18:04.260" style="s2">holding on to their high-performing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.059" end="00:18:05.850" style="s2">women even though they bend over</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.260" end="00:18:07.830" style="s2">backwards to do that is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.850" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">indication of exactly that and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.830" end="00:18:11.340" style="s2">notion that it&#39;s a glass ceiling in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">sense that are stopping women from</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.340" end="00:18:15.510" style="s2">advancing up the corporate ladder I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.130" style="s2">believe to be a truly erroneous as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.510" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">as dangerous and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.130" end="00:18:23.370" style="s2">real any really any evidence to support</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2">that so all right Fraser burns says</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.370" end="00:18:29.370" style="s2">highly creative stupendously low in</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.260" end="00:18:31.799" style="s2">conscientiousness am I doomed no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.370" end="00:18:34.110" style="s2">not doomed and I think that openness and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.799" end="00:18:35.040" style="s2">conscientiousness are often at odds with</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.110" end="00:18:37.890" style="s2">one another it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.040" end="00:18:40.440" style="s2">obvious to me how someone can easily be</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.890" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">highly creative and orderly for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.440" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">because to be creative means to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:49.590" style="s2">some disorder in the intermediary stages</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:52.800" style="s2">of being a creative person I would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.590" end="00:18:54.810" style="s2">also that many creative enterprises are</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.800" end="00:18:56.700" style="s2">not the sort of thing that anybody who</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.410" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">would ever pursue like the lifestyle of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.750" end="00:19:05.160" style="s2">a musician for example I would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.900" style="s2">though that if you&#39;re low in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.160" end="00:19:08.550" style="s2">conscientiousness and really high and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.900" end="00:19:10.590" style="s2">openness high in creativity is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.550" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have you&#39;re going to be</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:16.110" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.340" end="00:19:17.640" style="s2">implementing them you won&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.110" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">follow-through and you may have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.640" end="00:19:21.750" style="s2">really learn to discipline yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:23.670" style="s2">I would say the simplest way to start</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.750" end="00:19:25.350" style="s2">disciplining yourself is to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.670" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">something like Google Calendar to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.350" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">establish a schedule and and stick to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">the damn thing like train yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:34.740" style="s2">get up at the same time train yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:37.170" style="s2">to eat at the same time train yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.740" end="00:19:39.150" style="s2">to follow a schedule so that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.170" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">undertake the tasks that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.150" end="00:19:44.580" style="s2">undertake each week on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">but but you can leave in that a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.580" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">bit so that it doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:49.170" style="s2">intolerable by using the schedule to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">design days that you would want to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.170" end="00:19:52.860" style="s2">instead of just days that you should</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">have because you&#39;ll doesn&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.860" end="00:19:57.720" style="s2">tyrant the proper use of a schedule</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:19:59.580" style="s2">enables you to have the maximum amount</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.720" end="00:20:01.560" style="s2">of freedom while also maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.580" end="00:20:04.350" style="s2">responsibilities necessary to stop your</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.560" end="00:20:07.050" style="s2">life from augering into the ground so if</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.350" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">you&#39;re high and openness and and in all</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.050" end="00:20:10.470" style="s2">likelihood you&#39;re fairly intelligent if</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">that happens to be the case and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.470" end="00:20:13.470" style="s2">low in conscientiousness you might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:15.000" style="s2">able to get the best of both worlds by</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.470" end="00:20:17.130" style="s2">learning to discipline yourself but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.000" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">going to be a step-by-step process and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.130" end="00:20:20.970" style="s2">would also say do something like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:23.070" style="s2">Future authoring program from self</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.970" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">authoring calm and even if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.070" end="00:20:27.060" style="s2">badly because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2">will help you discipline yourself is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.060" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">have a plan and a plan is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:32.610" style="s2">something that all of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.110" end="00:20:34.260" style="s2">listening should know is like I really</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:37.590" style="s2">recommend doing that future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.260" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">program because you you will not get</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.590" end="00:20:42.780" style="s2">what you want unless you figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:44.670" style="s2">it is you won&#39;t be of as much to use to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.780" end="00:20:46.710" style="s2">yourself and to the broader world unless</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.670" end="00:20:47.980" style="s2">you develop a vision and implement it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.710" end="00:20:50.049" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.980" end="00:20:53.020" style="s2">the best way to do that is to do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.049" end="00:20:54.490" style="s2">seriously and and one of the best ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.020" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">to do something seriously is to write</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.490" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">about it so my goal is to be married and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:02.950" style="s2">on my way to starting a family within</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.600" style="s2">five years is this a legitimate goal to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.950" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">have for myself well absolutely I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.600" end="00:21:09.730" style="s2">absolutely all of these things can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:13.929" style="s2">made conscious I mean you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.730" end="00:21:16.570" style="s2">this romantic belief I suppose that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.929" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">you open yourself up to opportunity then</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.570" end="00:21:20.020" style="s2">it will ferret you out and your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">will come true but that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.020" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">naive way of looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.990" style="s2">it&#39;s much more likely to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:28.120" style="s2">that if you aim at something and and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.990" end="00:21:30.700" style="s2">aim carefully and thoughtfully that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.120" end="00:21:33.100" style="s2">you&#39;re that you will orient yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.700" end="00:21:35.020" style="s2">a manner that makes you aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.100" end="00:21:36.549" style="s2">opportunities that will arise that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.020" end="00:21:38.140" style="s2">put you in that direction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.549" end="00:21:40.210" style="s2">actually how your perceptual systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.140" end="00:21:42.130" style="s2">work and so part of the reason that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.210" end="00:21:45.460" style="s2">so useful to orient yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.130" end="00:21:47.830" style="s2">regards to a specific aim is that your</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.460" end="00:21:49.870" style="s2">perceptual systems then turn on to tell</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.830" end="00:21:52.330" style="s2">you what&#39;s going to facilitate your</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.870" end="00:21:54.940" style="s2">movement forward and also what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.330" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">to get in the way now you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.940" end="00:21:58.779" style="s2">be too single-minded about it because</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">you can get obsessive and you also want</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.779" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">to maintain enough flexibility in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">aim so that you can change them when</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:08.470" style="s2">necessary but there&#39;s absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:10.929" style="s2">wrong with deciding not only you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.470" end="00:22:12.490" style="s2">over what period of or during what</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.929" end="00:22:14.169" style="s2">timeframe you might want to get married</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.490" end="00:22:15.730" style="s2">and when you won&#39;t might want to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.169" end="00:22:18.010" style="s2">children but what kind of partner you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.730" end="00:22:19.390" style="s2">want to have and what what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.010" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">interests you would like to share with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.390" end="00:22:23.110" style="s2">them and to really specify your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.549" style="s2">because it&#39;s much more likely that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.110" end="00:22:26.440" style="s2">going to be turn out in a positive</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.549" end="00:22:28.299" style="s2">manner for you and everybody else if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.440" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">put some intelligent thought into it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.299" end="00:22:31.570" style="s2">just like it&#39;s the case that almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:36.750" style="s2">everything is likely to turn out better</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.570" end="00:22:38.679" style="s2">if you if you do that do you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.750" end="00:22:41.380" style="s2">homeschooling with the state public</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.679" end="00:22:42.220" style="s2">schools are currently in no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.380" end="00:22:43.990" style="s2">suggest it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.220" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">I think homeschooling is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.990" end="00:22:50.440" style="s2">difficult thing to pull off properly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">I think that there I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.440" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">number of people who would do it badly</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:56.500" style="s2">far exceeds the number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">would do it well having said that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.500" end="00:22:58.780" style="s2">not like I think it&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.360" end="00:23:00.790" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.780" end="00:23:02.590" style="s2">like I think that there isn&#39;t increasing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.790" end="00:23:04.150" style="s2">reason for parents to consider that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.590" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">because I do actually think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.150" end="00:23:07.660" style="s2">increasing reason for parents to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:09.430" style="s2">consider that because the postmodern new</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.660" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">Marxists have got their claws into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.430" end="00:23:12.790" style="s2">education system and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:14.680" style="s2">doing everything they can and you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.790" end="00:23:17.560" style="s2">certainly see that in in Canada in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.680" end="00:23:19.660" style="s2">Ontario where the Elementary Teachers</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.560" end="00:23:22.300" style="s2">Federation of Ontario has published</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.660" end="00:23:24.430" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.300" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">I think it&#39;s guideline curriculum it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.430" end="00:23:29.020" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:31.480" style="s2">blueprint for transforming kids into</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.020" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">social justice oriented individuals from</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.480" end="00:23:34.690" style="s2">kindergarten through grade 8 so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.130" end="00:23:39.730" style="s2">surprising that people want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.690" end="00:23:41.500" style="s2">so but I think that parental rights</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.730" end="00:23:43.240" style="s2">trump state rights in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.500" end="00:23:45.190" style="s2">children and it has to be that way even</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.240" end="00:23:48.130" style="s2">though there&#39;s lots of bad parents</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.190" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">the thing about bad parents is that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.130" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">state as parent is worse it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">there are no bad parents but to assume</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.380" style="s2">that the state is going to be a better</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">parent on average than parents who</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.380" end="00:24:02.020" style="s2">actually know if their children is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:03.790" style="s2">very bad idea so why is Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.790" end="00:24:08.910" style="s2">better than all of my favorite YouTube</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.160" end="00:24:34.540" style="s2">adapter but I think that that changes</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.440" end="00:24:36.040" style="s2">the category of camera to video camera</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.540" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">and then there&#39;s tax implications or</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.040" end="00:24:40.180" style="s2">something like that so I have the high</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.500" end="00:24:43.540" style="s2">quality camera and I have to put up with</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.180" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2">the fact that the battery dies so how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.540" end="00:24:49.320" style="s2">I plan to buffer myself from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:51.640" style="s2">deteriorating side effect of success</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.320" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.640" end="00:24:56.530" style="s2">um I can tell you bunch of answers to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:25:00.040" style="s2">that I mean the first is is that I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.530" end="00:25:02.410" style="s2">a sensible family a son and the daughter</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.040" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">and and soon to be a son-in-law and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.410" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">daughter-in-law as well who I like and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:09.220" style="s2">who like me and we get along really well</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">and they&#39;re really sensible people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.220" end="00:25:12.550" style="s2">so they help keep me my feet nailed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.550" end="00:25:16.270" style="s2">so does my wife because my wife is also</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">an extremely sensible person and someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.270" end="00:25:21.250" style="s2">I really deeply trust and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:23.230" style="s2">fortunate in that I have parents who who</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.250" end="00:25:27.490" style="s2">play that role with me as well and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.230" end="00:25:30.690" style="s2">sister and brother-in-law and and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.490" end="00:25:36.490" style="s2">brother as well who help me</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.690" end="00:25:39.460" style="s2">stay attuned to the potential dangers</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.490" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">that this widespread public exposure</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:45.130" style="s2">might otherwise produce but so but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:47.380" style="s2">other issue so there&#39;s that I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.130" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">advisors let&#39;s say who are on my side</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.380" end="00:25:51.550" style="s2">who tell me the truth and and we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.590" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing all the time to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.550" end="00:25:55.660" style="s2">that it&#39;s staying more or less on track</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.590" end="00:25:57.970" style="s2">the other thing too is though you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.660" end="00:26:02.620" style="s2">I&#39;m not exactly a young man anymore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.970" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">55 and I think a lot of the detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.620" end="00:26:08.170" style="s2">elements of widespread public exposure</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:10.030" style="s2">are things that would have been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.170" end="00:26:11.530" style="s2">more harmful or that are a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.030" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">harmful to people when they&#39;re younger</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.530" end="00:26:14.830" style="s2">there&#39;s just a lot of things about being</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:17.500" style="s2">in the public eye that don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.830" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">same cachet to me that they might have</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:21.640" style="s2">when I was a younger person or that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:23.260" style="s2">would have to a younger person and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.640" end="00:26:25.090" style="s2">guess I would also say that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.260" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">really believe that I&#39;m the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:30.520" style="s2">person to let and I&#39;m not trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">myself on a higher moral plane or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.520" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">anything with this comment but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:35.740" style="s2">think I&#39;m the kind of person to let the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:39.070" style="s2">sort of thing that&#39;s happened over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.740" end="00:26:41.050" style="s2">last year or so really go to my head and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.070" end="00:26:42.910" style="s2">I think part of the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.050" end="00:26:44.680" style="s2">that I have a fairly pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.910" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">depressive temperament and so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.680" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">see the negative side of myself with</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:53.410" style="s2">with plenty painful clarity and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:55.660" style="s2">more concerned about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.410" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">making a catastrophic mistake as I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.660" end="00:27:02.260" style="s2">present my publicly than I am in what</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:04.510" style="s2">clambering up some power ladder I</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.260" end="00:27:06.370" style="s2">suppose and elevating myself to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.510" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">position at the top I&#39;m just not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.370" end="00:27:12.490" style="s2">interested in that and so I think and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:17.410" style="s2">I&#39;m also I think fairly aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.490" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">dangers of of well let&#39;s say Fame to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.410" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">degree that that&#39;s what&#39;s occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.690" end="00:27:27.210" style="s2">I know the downside of that and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.770" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2">something that I&#39;m interested in and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.210" end="00:27:31.260" style="s2">actually I know it&#39;s a strange thing but</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:35.010" style="s2">to think about but I&#39;m actually also</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.260" end="00:27:37.260" style="s2">rather private person and and although</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.010" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">I&#39;m I can&#39;t keep my mouth shut obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.260" end="00:27:41.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m very talkative that&#39;s from being</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.140" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">very high in openness even more than</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.730" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">being high in extraversion I think and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:53.340" style="s2">but there isn&#39;t anything that comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.730" end="00:27:54.660" style="s2">along with the dark side of Fame let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.340" end="00:27:57.000" style="s2">say that I would find particularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.660" end="00:27:59.700" style="s2">attractive you know I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.000" end="00:28:02.520" style="s2">interested in partying endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.700" end="00:28:04.620" style="s2">although I had my time doing that when I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.520" end="00:28:08.610" style="s2">was young I&#39;m certainly not interested</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.620" end="00:28:13.530" style="s2">in whatever additional attractiveness to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.610" end="00:28:15.540" style="s2">two females that my more well-known the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.530" end="00:28:17.310" style="s2">fact that I&#39;m more my well-known might</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.540" end="00:28:19.470" style="s2">provide to me that that just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.310" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">interest me at all I&#39;m very happy in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.470" end="00:28:26.910" style="s2">marriage and also very aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">catastrophes that lie in directions of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.910" end="00:28:33.330" style="s2">that sort of temptation so but but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:37.170" style="s2">also I think of all those explanations</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.330" end="00:28:39.510" style="s2">the one that&#39;s most relevant is my see I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.170" end="00:28:41.370" style="s2">know that I&#39;m walking a tightrope in</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.510" end="00:28:43.050" style="s2">some sense and that it would be very</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.370" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">easy for me to make the kind of error</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.050" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">that would st. me and I&#39;m I know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:50.130" style="s2">there are many people who don&#39;t approve</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.140" style="s2">of what I&#39;m doing who would be very</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.130" end="00:28:55.890" style="s2">happy about that and so I think also</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.140" end="00:28:59.340" style="s2">living in a somewhat constant state of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.890" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">existential terror about the probability</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.340" end="00:29:04.950" style="s2">that this house of cards could collapse</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:10.020" style="s2">is also something that keeps me oriented</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.950" end="00:29:11.310" style="s2">in that humble direction and dwelling on</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.020" end="00:29:12.390" style="s2">this a little bit but really is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.310" end="00:29:15.900" style="s2">interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.390" end="00:29:18.930" style="s2">I am also I believe I also have trained</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.900" end="00:29:20.610" style="s2">myself so that I orient myself mostly to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.930" end="00:29:22.200" style="s2">considering what I&#39;m doing wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.610" end="00:29:26.100" style="s2">what I could be doing better than what</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.200" end="00:29:28.860" style="s2">I&#39;m doing right and so I&#39;m always on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.100" end="00:29:31.740" style="s2">lookout in all of the presentations I</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.860" end="00:29:33.060" style="s2">make for where I didn&#39;t say things as</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.740" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">clearly as I might have and where I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.060" end="00:29:36.040" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:40.090" style="s2">prove my delivery and so concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.040" end="00:29:43.210" style="s2">on where what I have yet to attain is</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.090" end="00:29:45.550" style="s2">also a good way of keeping whatever ego</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.210" end="00:29:48.040" style="s2">boost there might be in more widespread</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.550" end="00:29:50.200" style="s2">public recognition under control</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.040" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">having said that I&#39;m very it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.200" end="00:29:54.310" style="s2">I&#39;m ungrateful for the fact that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:57.550" style="s2">this has happened it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.310" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">amazing thrill I mean things happen to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.550" end="00:30:01.210" style="s2">me all the time that are that are so</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">overwhelmingly positive that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.210" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">believe it so last night for example I</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:06.610" style="s2">went to this restaurant called The Keg</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:08.050" style="s2">and I go there because I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.610" end="00:30:09.340" style="s2">food allergies and they&#39;re actually very</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.050" end="00:30:13.270" style="s2">careful with people who have food</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.340" end="00:30:15.190" style="s2">allergies and the waiter showed us to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.270" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">the table and he knew who I was and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.190" end="00:30:19.870" style="s2">said that he had been watching my videos</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:21.340" style="s2">and that he had had four promotions I</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.870" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">think that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing he said</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.340" end="00:30:25.480" style="s2">yeah four promotions in the last four</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:27.190" style="s2">months at the cake and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.480" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">that was that he had been watching my</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.190" end="00:30:30.730" style="s2">lectures and decided that he was going</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:33.550" style="s2">to adopt a more responsible attitude as</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.730" end="00:30:35.920" style="s2">an employee and also didn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.550" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">pushing the development of his career at</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.920" end="00:30:39.880" style="s2">this at this restaurant and that worked</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:43.720" style="s2">out brilliantly and like it was so</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.880" end="00:30:45.490" style="s2">positive because you know I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.720" end="00:30:47.740" style="s2">about it as a true victory on his part</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.490" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">because he took the situation that he</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.740" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">was actually in so a real situation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.200" end="00:30:54.790" style="s2">decided that he was going to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.650" style="s2">the opportunity that was there for him</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.790" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">and you know there was nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.650" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">that that&#39;s negative it&#39;s all positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:03.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s a personal story and he shared</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2">it with me and I had some small role in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.430" end="00:31:07.060" style="s2">bringing that about and like that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:08.560" style="s2">an absolute thrill as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.060" end="00:31:11.320" style="s2">concerned like every time someone writes</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.560" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">me and says I&#39;ve been watching your</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.320" end="00:31:15.610" style="s2">videos and I just decided to sort out my</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.630" end="00:31:17.140" style="s2">life and to aim higher and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.610" end="00:31:19.900" style="s2">working it&#39;s just like it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.140" end="00:31:21.910" style="s2">thrill for me to be able to provide that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.900" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">service for hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.910" end="00:31:27.490" style="s2">people it&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.990" end="00:31:29.290" style="s2">unbelievable privilege and I hope I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.490" end="00:31:32.350" style="s2">figure out how to do it better and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.290" end="00:31:33.640" style="s2">better as I get more and more practiced</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.350" end="00:31:35.380" style="s2">at it I mean that&#39;s really the aim and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.640" end="00:31:37.210" style="s2">with my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.380" end="00:31:39.100" style="s2">Daniel Higgins for example I have two</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.210" end="00:31:42.910" style="s2">business partner Daniel Higginson and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.100" end="00:31:45.700" style="s2">Robert Peel Peale was my graduate</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.910" end="00:31:46.840" style="s2">advisor at McGill and Daniel Higgins was</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.700" end="00:31:48.790" style="s2">one of my graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.840" end="00:31:50.740" style="s2">at Harvard and we&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.790" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">making psychological interventions</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.740" end="00:31:54.160" style="s2">accessible to people for about 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.690" end="00:31:56.710" style="s2">so they helped me develop the self</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.160" end="00:32:00.520" style="s2">authoring suite for example we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.710" end="00:32:02.830" style="s2">whole host of psychological tools in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.520" end="00:32:04.420" style="s2">development including future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.830" end="00:32:06.310" style="s2">program for high school students that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.420" end="00:32:08.770" style="s2">want to bring to the broader general</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.310" end="00:32:12.850" style="s2">public and so this public exposure also</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.770" end="00:32:14.950" style="s2">gives me the opportunity to to make what</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.850" end="00:32:16.630" style="s2">I know as a clinical psychologist and as</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.950" end="00:32:18.310" style="s2">someone with some specialization in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:20.440" style="s2">technology especially through my</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.310" end="00:32:24.160" style="s2">partnerships make that accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:25.660" style="s2">perhaps millions of people I mean god</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.160" end="00:32:30.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s just an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.660" end="00:32:33.280" style="s2">opportunity and so someone asks how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.760" end="00:32:35.560" style="s2">you find the self authoring</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.280" end="00:32:39.820" style="s2">autobiography outline well you go to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.560" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">self are 3com it&#39;s available there let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.820" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.549" end="00:32:49.850" style="s2">someone Annette Adler says I have also</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.109" end="00:32:52.190" style="s2">done better in a lot of things due to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.850" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">your kicks in the ass yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.190" end="00:32:55.549" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:32:58.840" style="s2">Annette I&#39;m thrilled to hear that see</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.549" end="00:33:01.359" style="s2">part of it you see the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.840" end="00:33:03.859" style="s2">disciplining someone let&#39;s say is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.359" end="00:33:05.690" style="s2">when you and I see this very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.859" end="00:33:08.419" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking to young people is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.690" end="00:33:13.669" style="s2">I&#39;m really on the side of the person</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.419" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">that wants to do something positive with</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.669" end="00:33:16.519" style="s2">their life to make their own life better</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:17.809" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s where you should</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.519" end="00:33:20.359" style="s2">start you should start by making</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.809" end="00:33:22.249" style="s2">maximizing the quality of your own life</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.359" end="00:33:23.869" style="s2">that&#39;s not a selfish thing or if it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.249" end="00:33:25.669" style="s2">it&#39;s the right kind of selfishness and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.869" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">that you should figure out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.669" end="00:33:28.669" style="s2">that in a way that&#39;s of benefit to your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">friends and your family and your</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.669" end="00:33:32.090" style="s2">community and you should take that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:33.950" style="s2">deadly seriously and the reason you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.090" end="00:33:36.909" style="s2">should do that is because that just</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.950" end="00:33:39.350" style="s2">makes life better for everyone and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.909" end="00:33:41.359" style="s2">reduces a fair bit of the misery that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.350" end="00:33:43.399" style="s2">would otherwise be part and parcel life</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.359" end="00:33:44.690" style="s2">and it makes everything function</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.399" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">smoothly and one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.690" end="00:33:47.989" style="s2">really curious about is what the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:49.700" style="s2">would be like if everybody decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.989" end="00:33:51.590" style="s2">that because human beings are really</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.700" end="00:33:53.570" style="s2">remarkable creatures and we hobble</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.590" end="00:33:56.149" style="s2">ourselves very badly with deception and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.570" end="00:33:58.549" style="s2">resentment and revenge and the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.149" end="00:34:02.059" style="s2">make things worse and arrogance and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.549" end="00:34:04.549" style="s2">those all those sins let&#39;s say that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.059" end="00:34:06.440" style="s2">that make us deviate from our true path</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.549" end="00:34:09.589" style="s2">and our true path should be something</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.440" end="00:34:12.020" style="s2">like imagine the noblest aim that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.589" end="00:34:14.179" style="s2">can conceptualize and then sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.020" end="00:34:16.790" style="s2">your life to attempting to attain it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.179" end="00:34:19.460" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in that that isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.790" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">for everyone and so apart from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.460" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">that it requires a lot of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.829" style="s2">I just can&#39;t see why everyone wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:26.690" style="s2">do that and when I&#39;m talking to young</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.829" end="00:34:28.250" style="s2">people and you know shaking my finger</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.690" end="00:34:30.109" style="s2">and saying you know grow the hell up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.250" end="00:34:32.030" style="s2">get mature and take on some</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.109" end="00:34:36.049" style="s2">responsibility I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">because I&#39;m an enemy of the person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.049" end="00:34:39.379" style="s2">saying it because I&#39;m the best friend of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:42.409" style="s2">the part of them that would really like</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.379" end="00:34:44.329" style="s2">to walk in the light and and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.409" end="00:34:46.339" style="s2">invitation to walk in the light and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.329" end="00:34:48.740" style="s2">it would be remarkable this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.339" end="00:34:50.629" style="s2">need to do as far as I&#39;m concerned not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.740" end="00:34:52.429" style="s2">only in the West but in the world at</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.629" end="00:34:56.809" style="s2">large but maybe in the West first is we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.429" end="00:34:57.810" style="s2">have to consciously decide that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.809" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">going to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.810" end="00:35:01.800" style="s2">we can as individuals to walk in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">light and to regard that as a noble and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.800" end="00:35:06.840" style="s2">heroic endeavor and to make that first</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">and foremost in our lives and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.840" end="00:35:10.620" style="s2">what we should be educating young people</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:12.330" style="s2">to do and they can do that and so I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.620" end="00:35:14.250" style="s2">dozens of people writing to me and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.330" end="00:35:15.570" style="s2">talking to me all the time who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.250" end="00:35:16.860" style="s2">saying the same thing they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.570" end="00:35:19.290" style="s2">look I&#39;ve really been trying to get my</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.860" end="00:35:22.140" style="s2">act together over the last six months</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:23.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying not to lie which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.140" end="00:35:25.110" style="s2">slightly different than trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.490" end="00:35:27.060" style="s2">the truth right it&#39;s a more humble goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.110" end="00:35:28.140" style="s2">to not lie because you can tell when</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.060" end="00:35:30.300" style="s2">you&#39;re lying but you can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.140" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">tell when you&#39;re telling the truth and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.300" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">I mean coming up with a plan and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">trying to discipline myself and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:37.650" style="s2">been cleaning up my room which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:39.810" style="s2">nice humble act that involves</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.650" end="00:35:41.130" style="s2">transforming chaos into order and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.810" end="00:35:42.840" style="s2">write and say god things are just</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.130" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">working out way better for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.840" end="00:35:47.010" style="s2">whoa</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">do it man that&#39;s just you you keep that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.010" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">up for 15 years and you&#39;ll be unbeatable</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we should be convincing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:55.050" style="s2">young people to be is to be unbeatable</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:57.120" style="s2">and not because that&#39;s what they should</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.050" end="00:35:59.220" style="s2">do or because they&#39;re bad if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.120" end="00:36:02.300" style="s2">but because there&#39;s nothing better you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.220" end="00:36:05.400" style="s2">can possibly do with your limited and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.300" end="00:36:07.860" style="s2">your limited and suffering bound life</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.400" end="00:36:09.450" style="s2">than to aim high and and sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.860" end="00:36:13.380" style="s2">yourself to the attainment of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.450" end="00:36:15.210" style="s2">goals so that&#39;s uh being a highly</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.380" end="00:36:16.740" style="s2">creative woman I find myself fearful</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.210" end="00:36:19.110" style="s2">that having kids will be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.740" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">suicide hindering my endeavors but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.110" end="00:36:23.150" style="s2">also don&#39;t want to have an unfulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.430" end="00:36:26.310" style="s2">life can I have a full life without kids</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.150" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">well yes I I suspect you can although</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.310" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">it&#39;s risky Maddy because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.190" style="s2">important for people to have kids</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:34.980" style="s2">because the thing is is that you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.190" end="00:36:36.540" style="s2">older than 40 and our culture is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.980" end="00:36:39.450" style="s2">dopey in that regards it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.540" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">underdeveloped we live as if we live as</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.450" end="00:36:43.740" style="s2">if we we only exist when we&#39;re young and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t it&#39;s like what are you gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.740" end="00:36:50.010" style="s2">from the ages of say 45 to 90 or 95 you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:51.330" style="s2">need a family around you you need to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.010" end="00:36:53.880" style="s2">your children girl you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.330" end="00:36:55.710" style="s2">grandchildren it&#39;s a major part maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.880" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">the most important part of the last half</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.710" end="00:37:00.930" style="s2">of life now you said being a highly</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:02.280" style="s2">creative woman I find myself fearful</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.930" end="00:37:03.960" style="s2">that having kids will be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.280" end="00:37:05.250" style="s2">suicide well that&#39;s the part of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.960" end="00:37:07.230" style="s2">question that I would really address</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.250" end="00:37:09.990" style="s2">because I would say well don&#39;t let them</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.230" end="00:37:11.130" style="s2">be spiritual suicide you know it may be</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.990" end="00:37:13.230" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.130" end="00:37:15.780" style="s2">amount of time that you need to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.230" end="00:37:18.360" style="s2">away from the kids then this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.780" end="00:37:20.070" style="s2">for parents in general so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.360" end="00:37:22.440" style="s2">pursue your own creative endeavors its</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.070" end="00:37:25.110" style="s2">children do not have to devour your life</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.440" end="00:37:27.210" style="s2">in fact if you let them devour your life</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.110" end="00:37:29.430" style="s2">then you&#39;ll hate them and you mistreat</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.210" end="00:37:31.290" style="s2">them and so what you want to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.430" end="00:37:33.240" style="s2">set yourself up so that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.290" end="00:37:34.710" style="s2">children and have a life and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.240" end="00:37:37.050" style="s2">better for the children and it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.710" end="00:37:39.540" style="s2">for you like children can be taught</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.050" end="00:37:41.400" style="s2">encouraged to spend a fair bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.540" end="00:37:43.770" style="s2">not when they&#39;re infants obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.400" end="00:37:45.960" style="s2">to spend a fair bit of time amusing</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.770" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">themselves that&#39;s especially the case if</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.960" end="00:37:50.070" style="s2">you have more than one child because</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:51.540" style="s2">they&#39;ll mutually amuse one another it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.070" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">actually easier in some ways to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.540" end="00:37:55.080" style="s2">more than one child because with one</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:37:57.450" style="s2">child you&#39;re constantly amusing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.080" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">child but with two or three then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.450" end="00:38:00.780" style="s2">off in their little you know Club</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:03.030" style="s2">especially if you can stop them from</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.780" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">developing sibling rivalry that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.030" end="00:38:07.410" style="s2">intense and they can monitor themselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:09.060" style="s2">so the trick is if you&#39;re a highly</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.410" end="00:38:10.290" style="s2">creative woman this be disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.060" end="00:38:12.390" style="s2">enough so that you can carve yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.290" end="00:38:14.130" style="s2">out your own space so that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.390" end="00:38:16.080" style="s2">come to resent your children and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.130" end="00:38:18.750" style="s2">afraid of that you&#39;re afraid that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.080" end="00:38:20.550" style="s2">looks like you&#39;re afraid that if you if</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.750" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">you give yourself two children there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.550" end="00:38:24.450" style="s2">be nothing left for you and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:25.740" style="s2">that can happen if you have children who</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.450" end="00:38:27.000" style="s2">have terrible health problems for</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.740" end="00:38:28.650" style="s2">example but you can&#39;t protect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.000" end="00:38:31.980" style="s2">against those eventualities in life</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.650" end="00:38:34.020" style="s2">anyways but I would say your best bet is</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.980" end="00:38:36.600" style="s2">to be a more selfish mother and believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.020" end="00:38:38.340" style="s2">me I&#39;ve had more clients who were ruined</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.600" end="00:38:39.630" style="s2">by mothers who were too unselfish than</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.630" end="00:38:44.910" style="s2">mothers who were too selfish so you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:46.890" style="s2">to be there when the kids need you but</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.910" end="00:38:52.700" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t be there any more than is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.890" end="00:38:52.700" style="s2">necessary so let&#39;s see</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.859" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">the same reason I&#39;m a full time pro</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.759" end="00:39:13.650" style="s2">well that&#39;s the look that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.690" end="00:39:16.190" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.650" end="00:39:18.150" style="s2">don&#39;t be thinking that you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.150" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">children the thing about modern people</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:24.059" style="s2">is that they&#39;re terrified of children</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:26.460" style="s2">they and this because they think they</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.059" end="00:39:28.380" style="s2">regard children as if they&#39;re miniature</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.460" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">tyrants and they can be of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:34.650" style="s2">because anyone will tyrannize over you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:37.140" style="s2">if you allow them to perhaps not anyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.650" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">but virtually anyone why not regulate</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.140" end="00:39:41.490" style="s2">your children&#39;s behavior I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:43.019" style="s2">chapter in my new book called don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.490" end="00:39:44.789" style="s2">your children do anything that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.019" end="00:39:47.910" style="s2">dislike them and that&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.789" end="00:39:49.529" style="s2">serious advice is like if you allow your</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.910" end="00:39:51.509" style="s2">children to conduct themselves around</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.529" end="00:39:53.099" style="s2">you in a manner that makes you dislike</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.509" end="00:39:55.259" style="s2">them if you&#39;re being honest if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.099" end="00:39:56.789" style="s2">paying attention to the shadow side of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.259" end="00:40:00.930" style="s2">yourself that can be aggressive and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.789" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">destructive then then you&#39;re if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.930" end="00:40:04.259" style="s2">allow your children to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:06.630" style="s2">make you dislike them then they&#39;re going</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.630" end="00:40:10.650" style="s2">mess up your life but you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.279" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">do that you&#39;re actually you actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.650" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">have a tremendous amount of control over</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:16.829" style="s2">the quality of your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.900" style="s2">your children and also the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.829" end="00:40:21.989" style="s2">which you choose to just disperse your</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.900" end="00:40:25.769" style="s2">time and I mean you&#39;re you&#39;ve got if</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.989" end="00:40:29.099" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to think it through and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.769" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">be clear you can be in charge of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.099" end="00:40:33.239" style="s2">household the children don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:35.700" style="s2">in charge and it&#39;s not good for them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.239" end="00:40:37.319" style="s2">be in charge anyways so people are</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.700" end="00:40:38.549" style="s2">afraid of children and it&#39;s too bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.319" end="00:40:41.549" style="s2">because children are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.549" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">wonderful I mean you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.549" end="00:40:45.089" style="s2">with them and they get tired and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:46.890" style="s2">get hungry and they get hot and and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.089" end="00:40:49.049" style="s2">don&#39;t have an attention span that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.890" end="00:40:52.499" style="s2">long as an adult who has a long</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.049" end="00:40:54.390" style="s2">attention span but they&#39;re great company</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.499" end="00:40:56.910" style="s2">and they&#39;re unbelievably comical and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.390" end="00:40:58.859" style="s2">they love you and like they give back</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.910" end="00:41:00.329" style="s2">far more than they take if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.859" end="00:41:04.619" style="s2">ounce of sense when you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.329" end="00:41:08.009" style="s2">them so yeah so so don&#39;t be afraid of</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:03.720" style="s2">of Foucault less of Derrida but enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.310" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">to get a pretty good sense of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.720" end="00:46:08.339" style="s2">on about like Foucault is readable but</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:10.829" style="s2">more or less obvious as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.339" end="00:46:12.390" style="s2">concerned and so he&#39;s a third-rate</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.330" end="00:52:09.780" style="s2">well the artists articulate the the</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.780" end="00:52:15.090" style="s2">articulate the unknown and so the role</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.900" end="00:52:18.630" style="s2">of artists in a healthy culture is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.090" end="00:52:20.930" style="s2">bring to public awareness elements of</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.620" end="00:52:34.680" style="s2">that maybe we can&#39;t even see the</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.080" end="00:52:42.510" style="s2">we&#39;re distant from the artists are right</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.420" end="00:52:46.170" style="s2">on the edge and they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.170" end="00:52:50.460" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re moving the culture</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.460" end="00:52:55.110" style="s2">guess they&#39;re moving the culture forward</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.400" end="00:52:57.500" style="s2">into the unknown and they do that by</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.110" end="00:53:00.870" style="s2">translating what is as of yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.500" end="00:53:03.960" style="s2">unimaginable but sensed into what is at</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.870" end="00:53:06.570" style="s2">least imaginable and represented</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.960" end="00:53:08.940" style="s2">represented in image and and drama and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.570" end="00:53:11.160" style="s2">literature and that&#39;s the precursor to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.940" end="00:53:13.470" style="s2">its full formulation in articulated</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.160" end="00:53:15.270" style="s2">philosophy and thought and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.470" end="00:53:17.220" style="s2">artists do their problem solvers their</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.270" end="00:53:19.620" style="s2">problem detectors and problem solvers</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.220" end="00:53:21.030" style="s2">that&#39;s what true artists do and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.620" end="00:53:22.920" style="s2">always trying to solve problems like if</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.030" end="00:53:25.350" style="s2">you there&#39;s a great documentary that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.920" end="00:53:26.910" style="s2">made about Picasso for example painting</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.350" end="00:53:29.070" style="s2">and unfortunately I can&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.910" end="00:53:30.750" style="s2">name of it I think it was made in 1957</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.070" end="00:53:33.720" style="s2">it&#39;s available on YouTube and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.750" end="00:53:37.710" style="s2">black and white and Picasso is filmed</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.720" end="00:53:38.940" style="s2">making a painting on a on a window so</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.710" end="00:53:41.070" style="s2">that you can see exactly what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.940" end="00:53:41.809" style="s2">and you can watch him work with ideas he</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.070" end="00:53:43.999" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.809" end="00:53:46.039" style="s2">paint something in in any erases that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.999" end="00:53:47.449" style="s2">you know he paints over it then he</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.039" end="00:53:49.819" style="s2">paints again and he paints over it he</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.449" end="00:53:51.499" style="s2">moves the figures around on the canvas</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.819" end="00:53:54.619" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a windowpane as I said and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.499" end="00:53:57.319" style="s2">you can see them working out visual you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.619" end="00:53:59.449" style="s2">can see them working out problems and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.319" end="00:54:02.269" style="s2">solutions to problems using using his</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.449" end="00:54:03.979" style="s2">visual imagination and the artistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.269" end="00:54:05.719" style="s2">product the painting is is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.979" end="00:54:08.329" style="s2">consequence of that rather than the aim</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.719" end="00:54:10.009" style="s2">of it the aim is to formulate the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.329" end="00:54:13.789" style="s2">problems and to work out the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.009" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">and the artistic product the painting is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.789" end="00:54:18.829" style="s2">the byproduct of that not the aim and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:20.539" style="s2">artists move us forward into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.829" end="00:54:22.519" style="s2">and you can see them doing that in</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.539" end="00:54:24.859" style="s2">cities because it&#39;s the open people the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.519" end="00:54:27.499" style="s2">artists who go into parts of the cities</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.859" end="00:54:29.689" style="s2">that are have degenerated to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.499" end="00:54:32.029" style="s2">back into chaos and then revitalize them</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.689" end="00:54:34.299" style="s2">and they civilize them and then the less</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.029" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">artistic people who who are more</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.299" end="00:54:38.239" style="s2">conventional move in and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:39.650" style="s2">when you get gentrification and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.239" end="00:54:41.239" style="s2">sort of thing and that usually chases</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.650" end="00:54:41.660" style="s2">the artists out and they go somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.239" end="00:54:43.069" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.660" end="00:54:45.529" style="s2">cheap and interesting and start the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.069" end="00:54:48.529" style="s2">renewal process again so the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.529" end="00:54:50.809" style="s2">artists and it&#39;s a hard thing to balance</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.529" end="00:54:52.789" style="s2">property in our culture is that artists</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.809" end="00:54:55.279" style="s2">are unbelievably productive economically</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.789" end="00:54:57.559" style="s2">but it&#39;s very very hard for them to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.279" end="00:54:58.910" style="s2">monetize their productivity so even</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.559" end="00:55:01.880" style="s2">though what they produce can be of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.910" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">incalculable value it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.880" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">for them to get any of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.509" style="s2">value that they&#39;re produced actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:10.939" style="s2">directed towards them it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.509" end="00:55:12.769" style="s2">problem in and it&#39;s a major problem with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.939" end="00:55:13.249" style="s2">trade openness as a mode of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.769" end="00:55:17.150" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.249" end="00:55:18.979" style="s2">so it&#39;s post modernism as destructive in</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.150" end="00:55:21.559" style="s2">this realm as it is in politics</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.979" end="00:55:23.599" style="s2">post-modernism is perhaps equally</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.559" end="00:55:25.549" style="s2">destructive in all realms as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.599" end="00:55:27.319" style="s2">can tell especially when it&#39;s a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.549" end="00:55:28.939" style="s2">with new Marxism and those two things</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.319" end="00:55:30.769" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason they should go</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.939" end="00:55:33.469" style="s2">hand-in-hand you know because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.769" end="00:55:35.929" style="s2">a post modernist there&#39;s absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.469" end="00:55:38.269" style="s2">reason stemming from your own philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.929" end="00:55:40.130" style="s2">that you should allow yourself with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.269" end="00:55:41.779" style="s2">new Marxist political outlook and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.130" end="00:55:45.229" style="s2">fact that those two things are found</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.779" end="00:55:48.289" style="s2">together almost inevitably indicates to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.229" end="00:55:50.630" style="s2">me that post-modernism is the handmaiden</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.289" end="00:55:51.529" style="s2">of the neo-marxists rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.630" end="00:55:53.989" style="s2">other way around</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.529" end="00:55:55.400" style="s2">so in fact post-modernism is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.989" end="00:55:58.789" style="s2">intellectual front that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.400" end="00:56:00.470" style="s2">Marxists we&#39;re or a dog to hide from</p>

<p begin="01:01:49.070" end="01:01:54.920" style="s2">happy about it and part of the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.810" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">for that involves some of the elements</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.920" end="01:01:58.700" style="s2">of our earlier discussion people were</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.670" style="s2">saying well how do you plan to keep your</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.700" end="01:02:04.890" style="s2">feet on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.670" end="01:02:09.390" style="s2">say given your new phone public profile</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.890" end="01:02:11.880" style="s2">and I see the the mean culture as part</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.390" end="01:02:14.609" style="s2">of the corrective I mean there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.880" end="01:02:17.339" style="s2">role for satire and irony and all of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.609" end="01:02:20.069" style="s2">elements of comedy to to act as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.339" end="01:02:22.140" style="s2">corrective and I mean I&#39;d been fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.069" end="01:02:24.750" style="s2">because most of the memes that have been</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.140" end="01:02:28.190" style="s2">directed my way have been done with good</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.750" end="01:02:31.970" style="s2">humor I&#39;m lucky because for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.190" end="01:02:35.400" style="s2">the ratio of positive attention I</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.970" end="01:02:38.819" style="s2">received from the general public let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.400" end="01:02:41.400" style="s2">say is compared to the ratio to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.819" end="01:02:43.170" style="s2">amount of negative reactions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.400" end="01:02:45.059" style="s2">receiving is very disproportionate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.170" end="01:02:46.740" style="s2">receiving almost all positive reactions</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.059" end="01:02:48.119" style="s2">so you know I&#39;m in the fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.740" end="01:02:51.450" style="s2">position of being able to laugh along</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.119" end="01:02:53.099" style="s2">with it but I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.450" end="01:02:55.460" style="s2">any reason to assume that irony and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.099" end="01:02:57.720" style="s2">satire have to become cruel and scoffing</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.460" end="01:02:59.450" style="s2">they they can be done with a light touch</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.720" end="01:03:04.109" style="s2">and they can be done in a manner that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.450" end="01:03:08.760" style="s2">keeps everybody awake and make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.109" end="01:03:15.390" style="s2">no one is above both criticism and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.760" end="01:03:17.130" style="s2">and humor that they&#39;re now that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.390" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">thing can become cynical very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.130" end="01:03:21.480" style="s2">but it degenerates as soon as it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:23.250" style="s2">cynical you see this with satirical</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.480" end="01:03:25.079" style="s2">shows you know like I really like The</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.250" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">Simpsons the first 13 seasons in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.079" end="01:03:29.970" style="s2">particular and like it it was one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:32.220" style="s2">very rare true satires on American</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.970" end="01:03:36.710" style="s2">television and it never degenerated into</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.220" end="01:03:39.180" style="s2">cynicism in part because although it</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.710" end="01:03:41.880" style="s2">comedic ly critiqued almost every</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:44.040" style="s2">element of American life it was also it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.880" end="01:03:46.559" style="s2">also had a set of messages that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.040" end="01:03:48.660" style="s2">very positive so for example the Simpson</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.559" end="01:03:50.790" style="s2">family was an extraordinarily coherent</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.660" end="01:03:52.710" style="s2">nuclear family unit and for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.790" end="01:03:54.780" style="s2">homers faults might have been and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.710" end="01:03:58.140" style="s2">were myriad he was always there as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.780" end="01:04:00.869" style="s2">reliable and trustworthy father to his</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.140" end="01:04:02.849" style="s2">family despite his you know somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.869" end="01:04:04.920" style="s2">limited abilities both ethically and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.849" end="01:04:07.349" style="s2">intellectually he was there when it</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.920" end="01:04:09.270" style="s2">counted and that stopped that show from</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.349" end="01:04:10.619" style="s2">degenerating into cynicism and I also</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.270" end="01:04:12.839" style="s2">think the same about the Trailer Park</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.619" end="01:04:14.339" style="s2">Boys which is a show that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.839" end="01:04:17.069" style="s2">have a fair bit of partiality for</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.339" end="01:04:19.979" style="s2">despite its its endless profanity and</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.069" end="01:04:21.829" style="s2">and an absurdity it has the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.979" end="01:04:24.660" style="s2">underlying structure is that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.829" end="01:04:26.519" style="s2">characters are bound together by genuine</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.660" end="01:04:29.339" style="s2">affection and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.519" end="01:04:32.219" style="s2">that that that makes the satirical</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.339" end="01:04:36.680" style="s2">message both positive and deeply</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.219" end="01:04:36.680" style="s2">acceptable as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.660" end="01:04:45.710" style="s2">I know lots of laughs Jordan watches</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.089" end="01:04:47.510" style="s2">trailer park boys I don&#39;t just watch it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.710" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">I really like it I really get a kick out</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.510" end="01:04:50.839" style="s2">of it I don&#39;t know how many of you are</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">Trailer Park Boys aficionado is probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.839" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">not that many because it is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:57.799" style="s2">rough show but the conky episode that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:04:59.780" style="s2">going to be one of them the high that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.799" end="01:05:01.819" style="s2">one of the highest that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.780" end="01:05:03.230" style="s2">highest reach of Canadian comedy as far</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.819" end="01:05:05.150" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned that episode just</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.230" end="01:05:10.250" style="s2">absolutely floored me it was so it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.150" end="01:05:13.390" style="s2">so surreal and so absurd that all right</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.250" end="01:05:13.390" style="s2">let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.470" end="01:05:26.810" style="s2">what&#39;re is your advice for someone who</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.170" end="01:05:28.250" style="s2">lives with chronic pain wow that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.810" end="01:05:30.020" style="s2">tough one how can I discipline myself</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.250" end="01:05:31.670" style="s2">mentally in order to be productive when</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.020" end="01:05:36.980" style="s2">I feel awful all the time</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.670" end="01:05:39.079" style="s2">what coping mechanism posed by shivers</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.980" end="01:05:41.300" style="s2">is like if you&#39;re suffering chronic pain</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.079" end="01:05:43.430" style="s2">one of the things you can do is try not</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.300" end="01:05:46.099" style="s2">to judge yourself too harshly man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.430" end="01:05:47.540" style="s2">really rough and why don&#39;t you start by</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.099" end="01:05:49.010" style="s2">assuming that if you&#39;re having a hard</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.540" end="01:05:50.810" style="s2">time disciplining yourself that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.010" end="01:05:53.150" style="s2">actually a consequence of the chronic</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.810" end="01:05:54.589" style="s2">pain rather than a moral fault you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.150" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">like I&#39;ve dealt with lots of people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.589" end="01:05:59.300" style="s2">have had terrible chronic health</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:06:02.089" style="s2">problems and you know you you you you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.300" end="01:06:05.750" style="s2">want to push yourself because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.089" end="01:06:08.780" style="s2">want to end up in a situation where the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.750" end="01:06:11.089" style="s2">disease condition is taking more away</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.780" end="01:06:13.160" style="s2">from you than it absolutely has to so</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.089" end="01:06:15.140" style="s2">you attempt to impose minimal</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.160" end="01:06:17.420" style="s2">disciplinary structures on yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.140" end="01:06:19.460" style="s2">to push the illness back as much as you</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.420" end="01:06:23.210" style="s2">can but if you&#39;re in chronic pain I</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.460" end="01:06:25.400" style="s2">would say you need to find someone that</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.210" end="01:06:28.040" style="s2">you can trust to talk to so that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.400" end="01:06:29.690" style="s2">can help you plan and you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.040" end="01:06:31.579" style="s2">able to delineate out what your</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.690" end="01:06:33.550" style="s2">limitations are in a manner that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.579" end="01:06:37.490" style="s2">can understand so that you can jointly</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.550" end="01:06:39.079" style="s2">focus on how to make productive use and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.490" end="01:06:42.020" style="s2">high-quality use of the time that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.079" end="01:06:43.640" style="s2">can actually spend outside of merely</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.020" end="01:06:45.890" style="s2">suffering the other thing that I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.640" end="01:06:48.800" style="s2">ask you about is are you sure that your</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.890" end="01:06:51.230" style="s2">medication regime regimen is adjusted</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.800" end="01:06:54.910" style="s2">optimally because antidepressants for</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.230" end="01:06:57.010" style="s2">example can be very effective long-term</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.910" end="01:07:00.710" style="s2">medication for chronic pain especially</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.010" end="01:07:02.359" style="s2">drugs like celexa which so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.710" end="01:07:04.040" style="s2">if you use an antidepressant in your</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.359" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">attempts to manage your chronic pain but</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.040" end="01:07:06.770" style="s2">that&#39;s something I would definitely</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:09.440" style="s2">recommend and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.770" end="01:07:10.970" style="s2">pharmaceutical treatment and you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:12.410" style="s2">you may have run the gamut already I</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.970" end="01:07:14.300" style="s2">know lots of people who have chronic</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.410" end="01:07:18.020" style="s2">pain have done that but and also</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.300" end="01:07:19.550" style="s2">stimulants like the ADHD medications can</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.020" end="01:07:23.300" style="s2">also be helpful in the management of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.550" end="01:07:25.579" style="s2">pain because stimulant medication has an</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.300" end="01:07:27.260" style="s2">analgesic properties so you might want</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.579" end="01:07:29.540" style="s2">to consult a number of specialists about</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.260" end="01:07:31.640" style="s2">your medication regimen to see that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.540" end="01:07:32.829" style="s2">you&#39;re medicated to the optimal degree</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.640" end="01:07:36.099" style="s2">but I would definitely recommend</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.829" end="01:07:37.630" style="s2">antidepressants and also fine and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.099" end="01:07:40.299" style="s2">talking to someone find someone you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.630" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">trust so that you can talk to them about</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.299" end="01:07:44.140" style="s2">your genuine limitations and how you</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:46.599" style="s2">might transcend them and and also see if</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.140" end="01:07:49.420" style="s2">you cannot torture yourself with guilt</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.599" end="01:07:51.369" style="s2">because you aren&#39;t able to live the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.420" end="01:07:52.809" style="s2">productive life that someone who&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.369" end="01:07:56.950" style="s2">of chronic pain might I mean it can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.809" end="01:07:58.660" style="s2">unbelievably debilitating so mostly well</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.950" end="01:08:03.489" style="s2">so I&#39;m very sorry to hear that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.660" end="01:08:06.609" style="s2">plaguing you and and when you say how</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.489" end="01:08:09.219" style="s2">can I discipline myself I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.609" end="01:08:10.869" style="s2">afraid I&#39;ve lost the question you you</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.219" end="01:08:12.039" style="s2">said how can I discipline myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.869" end="01:08:14.410" style="s2">something like how can I discipline</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.039" end="01:08:21.009" style="s2">myself when I&#39;m in in chronic pain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.410" end="01:08:23.920" style="s2">like well I think the more appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.009" end="01:08:25.659" style="s2">question might be how can you ensure you</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.920" end="01:08:27.759" style="s2">that you treat yourself with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.659" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">appropriate compassion if you happen to</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.759" end="01:08:32.020" style="s2">be living with severe chronic pain and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:36.690" style="s2">maybe the disciplinary element should be</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.020" end="01:08:36.690" style="s2">secondary it&#39;s something like that so</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.960" end="01:08:45.770" style="s2">I&#39;m getting tired guys so I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.940" end="01:08:47.779" style="s2">gonna stop at nine I&#39;m gonna stop at</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.770" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">9:30 because I&#39;m gonna start becoming</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.779" end="01:08:51.380" style="s2">incoherent if I don&#39;t so just to give</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:54.589" style="s2">you a warning we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.380" end="01:08:56.930" style="s2">run this for 15 more minutes so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.589" end="01:08:59.810" style="s2">joining the military a respectable path</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.930" end="01:09:01.609" style="s2">for my life well I would say it would</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.810" end="01:09:04.520" style="s2">likely depend on how you conduct</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.609" end="01:09:06.469" style="s2">yourself as a soldier it and also what</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.520" end="01:09:08.630" style="s2">your alternatives are but I wouldn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.469" end="01:09:10.190" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say yes without reservation</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.630" end="01:09:11.810" style="s2">but I certainly wouldn&#39;t say no without</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.190" end="01:09:14.839" style="s2">reservation I think joining the military</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.810" end="01:09:16.460" style="s2">can be a respectable pathway for your</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.839" end="01:09:21.049" style="s2">life I mean it&#39;s obviously a complex</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.460" end="01:09:23.509" style="s2">pathway but it&#39;s it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.049" end="01:09:25.040" style="s2">military isn&#39;t a necessity and so if</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.509" end="01:09:27.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something in you that tilts you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.040" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">in that direction then perhaps that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.980" end="01:09:37.089" style="s2">courage in you talking that&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:37.089" style="s2">possible so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.760" end="01:09:49.340" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to the pigeonhole thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.890" end="01:09:51.200" style="s2">here becoming a truthful person involves</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.340" end="01:09:52.940" style="s2">dealing with the guilt of past lies is</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.200" end="01:09:54.830" style="s2">it better to come clean about old lies</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.940" end="01:09:56.720" style="s2">even if they will ruin lives or forgive</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.830" end="01:10:00.380" style="s2">yourself and focus on living truthfully</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.720" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">in the present and future that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.380" end="01:10:10.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:11.060" style="s2">say that there there are telling the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.730" end="01:10:15.290" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.060" end="01:10:17.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean saying everything about</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.290" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">everything all the time it&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.930" end="01:10:22.130" style="s2">complicated than that first of all you</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:24.140" style="s2">have a right to privacy and second like</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.130" end="01:10:26.540" style="s2">here&#39;s an example this is a tricky one</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.140" end="01:10:29.000" style="s2">but I think it would address your</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.540" end="01:10:30.830" style="s2">question imagine that you&#39;ve had an</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.000" end="01:10:32.450" style="s2">affair you have a happy marriage but you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.830" end="01:10:34.070" style="s2">had an affair and maybe you had an</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.450" end="01:10:35.540" style="s2">affair three years ago and maybe it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.070" end="01:10:36.890" style="s2">you know a couple of weeks or a couple</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.540" end="01:10:39.530" style="s2">of months or maybe it was even only one</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.890" end="01:10:41.060" style="s2">night and it&#39;s driving you crazy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.530" end="01:10:43.880" style="s2">guilty about it and you feel that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.060" end="01:10:46.790" style="s2">should confess and I would say well the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.880" end="01:10:50.630" style="s2">first question is have you learned your</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.790" end="01:10:53.270" style="s2">lesson and the lesson should be you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.630" end="01:10:55.070" style="s2">processed what you&#39;ve done and decrease</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.270" end="01:10:55.520" style="s2">the probability that you will do it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.070" end="01:10:57.740" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.520" end="01:11:00.200" style="s2">to something as closely approximating</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.740" end="01:11:02.450" style="s2">zero as possible and then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.200" end="01:11:05.150" style="s2">ask yourself what makes you think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.450" end="01:11:07.550" style="s2">you have any right to confess because</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.150" end="01:11:09.470" style="s2">then what you would do is take the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.550" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">original transgression which was quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.470" end="01:11:14.600" style="s2">severe and hurt someone very badly by</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.040" end="01:11:15.800" style="s2">revealing it and you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.600" end="01:11:17.660" style="s2">you&#39;ll pat yourself on the back for</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.800" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">being a truthful person about it but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.660" end="01:11:22.970" style="s2">would say you&#39;ve already sacrificed the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:26.090" style="s2">right you have to be truthful about that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.970" end="01:11:28.700" style="s2">and and I know I&#39;m oversimplifying it</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.090" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">because the only way to not oversimplify</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.700" end="01:11:32.090" style="s2">such a thing is to use a real example</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:34.970" style="s2">and not a hypothetical example but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.090" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">think many times the moral thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.970" end="01:11:41.090" style="s2">is to take your guilty secrets to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:42.350" style="s2">grave and maybe you can talk about them</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.090" end="01:11:43.790" style="s2">with a therapist or you can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.350" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">them with someone that you really trust</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.790" end="01:11:49.250" style="s2">who will maintain confidentiality but</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:52.010" style="s2">you don&#39;t come clean about old lives</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.250" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not coming clean about old lies</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.010" end="01:11:56.300" style="s2">generally if that will ruin lives and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:58.400" style="s2">don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.300" end="01:11:59.929" style="s2">forgive yourself precisely and focus on</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:02.329" style="s2">living truthfully in the future you</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.929" end="01:12:04.130" style="s2">focus on living truthfully in the future</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.329" end="01:12:05.780" style="s2">and perhaps you don&#39;t forgive yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.130" end="01:12:07.820" style="s2">exactly that doesn&#39;t mean you pound</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.780" end="01:12:09.619" style="s2">yourself into the ground with guilt but</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.820" end="01:12:11.059" style="s2">if you have done things in the past that</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.619" end="01:12:13.159" style="s2">were reprehensible and that would</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.059" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">destroy lives if we&#39;re brought to light</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.159" end="01:12:19.460" style="s2">then you should I think that generally</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.840" end="01:12:22.250" style="s2">speaking you should do everything you</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.460" end="01:12:24.619" style="s2">can to limit the spread of damage as you</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.250" end="01:12:29.119" style="s2">attempt to move truthfully into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.619" end="01:12:31.130" style="s2">future so you&#39;ve said that a marriage</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.119" end="01:12:33.860" style="s2">must be based on trust and transparency</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.130" end="01:12:35.630" style="s2">and being shackled together how and for</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.860" end="01:12:38.510" style="s2">how long should you get to know someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.630" end="01:12:41.360" style="s2">how to set a foundation oh well you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.510" end="01:12:43.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no simple answer to</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.360" end="01:12:43.630" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.540" end="01:12:58.270" style="s2">I think that you should know someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.570" end="01:13:00.190" style="s2">well enough so that you can so that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.270" end="01:13:03.490" style="s2">know if you can negotiate with them and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.190" end="01:13:05.710" style="s2">so that you have started to formulate a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.490" end="01:13:11.410" style="s2">vision of your joint future that you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.710" end="01:13:15.040" style="s2">both look forward to with enthusiasm and</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.410" end="01:13:16.690" style="s2">confidence so and of course that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.040" end="01:13:19.630" style="s2">to depend to some degree on your level</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.690" end="01:13:23.530" style="s2">of maturity but that means you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.630" end="01:13:25.540" style="s2">considered such things as do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.530" end="01:13:27.220" style="s2">sufficient number of joint interests and</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.540" end="01:13:29.350" style="s2">are you oriented in the same direction</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.220" end="01:13:31.030" style="s2">with regards to how you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.350" end="01:13:33.460" style="s2">handle your joint careers and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.030" end="01:13:34.840" style="s2">possibility of children and the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.460" end="01:13:37.150" style="s2">manner in which you&#39;re going to interact</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.840" end="01:13:41.070" style="s2">with your in-laws and you you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.150" end="01:13:43.720" style="s2">start thinking about you have to start</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.070" end="01:13:45.610" style="s2">considering your life together from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.720" end="01:13:48.490" style="s2">perspective of practicality and</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.610" end="01:13:51.670" style="s2">economics I would say so it can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.490" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">be that massive erotic attraction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.670" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">associated with with love although I</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.400" end="01:13:57.430" style="s2">think that&#39;s extraordinarily important</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:13:58.930" style="s2">and you&#39;re unbelievably fortunate if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.430" end="01:14:00.820" style="s2">have that and you should do everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.930" end="01:14:02.770" style="s2">you can to maintain it which and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.820" end="01:14:06.490" style="s2">takes effort that takes real effort and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.770" end="01:14:08.380" style="s2">will but you need to ally that with with</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.490" end="01:14:10.120" style="s2">maturity and intelligence and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.380" end="01:14:11.950" style="s2">maturity and intelligence is okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.120" end="01:14:13.870" style="s2">going to put our lives together what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.950" end="01:14:15.610" style="s2">that going to look like at the level of</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.610" end="01:14:20.110" style="s2">finances where are we going to live what</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.430" end="01:14:22.390" style="s2">are our joint plans going to be it</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.110" end="01:14:26.580" style="s2">cetera one of the things that my</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.390" end="01:14:30.910" style="s2">business partners and I plan to do in in</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.580" end="01:14:32.680" style="s2">what would you say that in as an analog</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.910" end="01:14:35.290" style="s2">to the self authoring suite is that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.680" end="01:14:37.390" style="s2">want to develop an online program to</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.290" end="01:14:40.330" style="s2">help people negotiate their</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.390" end="01:14:41.710" style="s2">relationships and and so it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.330" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">actually provide an answer to this</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.710" end="01:14:46.180" style="s2">question in a more comprehensive manner</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:48.730" style="s2">is that imagine that if you want to set</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.180" end="01:14:50.890" style="s2">up a household with someone then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.730" end="01:14:52.270" style="s2">a lot of things that you need to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.890" end="01:14:55.270" style="s2">straight and you either do that by</p>

<p begin="01:15:17.020" end="01:15:21.460" style="s2">bills and who&#39;s going to do which part</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.700" end="01:15:22.840" style="s2">of what household chores there are to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.460" end="01:15:26.710" style="s2">and how is that going to be laid out</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.840" end="01:15:28.630" style="s2">fair and so you should get to know you</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.710" end="01:15:31.330" style="s2">should get to know the person that</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.630" end="01:15:33.550" style="s2">you&#39;re with well enough so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.330" end="01:15:36.160" style="s2">start discussing the real practical</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.550" end="01:15:38.860" style="s2">issues of life and determine whether or</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.160" end="01:15:40.480" style="s2">not you&#39;re capable of of negotiating</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.860" end="01:15:42.760" style="s2">that and I don&#39;t think that necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.480" end="01:15:45.400" style="s2">means that you should live together</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.760" end="01:15:47.500" style="s2">because the evidence is actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.400" end="01:15:49.870" style="s2">strong at least the last time I look</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.500" end="01:15:51.970" style="s2">that people who live together are more</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.870" end="01:15:53.680" style="s2">rather than less likely to be divorced</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.970" end="01:15:55.210" style="s2">now that might be that might have</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.680" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">nothing to do with the actual act of</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.210" end="01:15:58.630" style="s2">living together it might be that people</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:00.340" style="s2">who are more likely to get divorced or</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.630" end="01:16:02.140" style="s2">also those who are more likely to merely</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.340" end="01:16:05.080" style="s2">live together but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.140" end="01:16:07.330" style="s2">great solution for reasons I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.080" end="01:16:09.580" style="s2">into now and with regards to being</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.330" end="01:16:11.680" style="s2">shackled together is that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.580" end="01:16:13.510" style="s2">complicated one and and I learned this</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.680" end="01:16:16.990" style="s2">at least in part from reading Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:19.570" style="s2">and the idea there is that unless you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.990" end="01:16:22.090" style="s2">really made a commitment to someone like</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.570" end="01:16:23.800" style="s2">a lifetime commitment and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.090" end="01:16:26.050" style="s2">serious commitment one that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.800" end="01:16:27.940" style="s2">going to back out of you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.050" end="01:16:30.610" style="s2">take the relationship with a seriousness</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.940" end="01:16:32.050" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary to make it of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.610" end="01:16:33.790" style="s2">highest possible quality and</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.050" end="01:16:35.800" style="s2">sustainability across the course of your</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.790" end="01:16:37.120" style="s2">life and it&#39;s really important that it</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.800" end="01:16:39.070" style="s2">is of that high quality and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.120" end="01:16:40.810" style="s2">sustainability because the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.070" end="01:16:43.750" style="s2">especially when it starts to produce</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.810" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">children is a machine let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.750" end="01:16:47.710" style="s2">machine that you jointly operate that</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:49.840" style="s2">adds immensely to the quality of your</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.710" end="01:16:52.870" style="s2">life and the depth of your life I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.840" end="01:16:55.090" style="s2">you you have the rope and strand of your</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.870" end="01:16:57.100" style="s2">life and your partner has the strands</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.090" end="01:16:58.810" style="s2">and the rope of his or her life and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.100" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2">those are tied together to make a</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.810" end="01:17:03.640" style="s2">stronger rope and then that unites you</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:06.250" style="s2">across time and then you undertake</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.640" end="01:17:07.870" style="s2">massive adventures together and some of</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.250" end="01:17:09.790" style="s2">that is the establishment of a household</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.870" end="01:17:11.140" style="s2">and the establishment of joint careers</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.790" end="01:17:12.970" style="s2">and the maintenance of each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.140" end="01:17:14.710" style="s2">mental and physical health and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.970" end="01:17:16.750" style="s2">maintenance of a high quality sexual</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.710" end="01:17:19.710" style="s2">life and all of that very very Chao</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.750" end="01:17:22.690" style="s2">to do all of that and then the joint</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.710" end="01:17:25.300" style="s2">production end and care of children</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.690" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">which which sets you up properly for the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.300" end="01:17:30.430" style="s2">last half of your life so like I&#39;m 55</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:32.470" style="s2">now you know and both my kids just got</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.430" end="01:17:34.240" style="s2">engaged in the last month so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.470" end="01:17:37.600" style="s2">pretty bloody amazing and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.240" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">setting up households and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.600" end="01:17:40.810" style="s2">stepping into adulthood and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:42.970" style="s2">fortunate enough to have them in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.810" end="01:17:45.610" style="s2">city that I live in so hooray for me</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.970" end="01:17:46.990" style="s2">that&#39;s so bloody fortunate that I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.610" end="01:17:50.230" style="s2">hardly believe it I mean we&#39;ve helped</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.990" end="01:17:53.020" style="s2">them out and tried to make it what would</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.230" end="01:17:54.880" style="s2">you say to make the possibility of their</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.020" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">living here be something that&#39;s viable</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.880" end="01:17:57.820" style="s2">but I&#39;m absolutely thrilled that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:17:59.770" style="s2">going to be around and I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.820" end="01:18:01.930" style="s2">forward immensely to having</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.770" end="01:18:04.900" style="s2">grandchildren and like what else are you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.930" end="01:18:06.940" style="s2">gonna do when you&#39;re 55 you know and</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.900" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be 55 it&#39;s good I might</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.940" end="01:18:11.440" style="s2">have 40 more years like what am I gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:12.850" style="s2">do with those years well so I have a</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.440" end="01:18:15.250" style="s2">good marriage thank God for that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.850" end="01:18:17.740" style="s2">that&#39;s partly due to the outstanding</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.250" end="01:18:19.920" style="s2">moral quality of my life my wife who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.740" end="01:18:22.120" style="s2">also extraordinarily attracted to and</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.920" end="01:18:23.710" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve built a life together and</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.120" end="01:18:25.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve had kids together and we&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.710" end="01:18:28.000" style="s2">with our kids and we had plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.710" end="01:18:30.190" style="s2">struggle with our kids because one of</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.000" end="01:18:32.560" style="s2">our children my daughter had serious</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.190" end="01:18:35.380" style="s2">serious health problems which she seems</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.560" end="01:18:38.710" style="s2">to have managed to resolve partly as a</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.380" end="01:18:41.140" style="s2">consequence of her own brilliance but</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.710" end="01:18:43.390" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve set ourselves up now so</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.140" end="01:18:45.580" style="s2">that our children are respectable and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.390" end="01:18:47.860" style="s2">mature young adults so thank God for</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.580" end="01:18:49.930" style="s2">that and they&#39;ve got partners who we</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.860" end="01:18:51.820" style="s2">both really like and they&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.930" end="01:18:53.770" style="s2">children and well hooray</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.820" end="01:18:55.210" style="s2">you know that means that this next part</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.770" end="01:18:57.790" style="s2">of my life is going to be something that</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.210" end="01:19:00.730" style="s2">I could invest into with with a fair bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.790" end="01:19:02.380" style="s2">of hope and and and excitement and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.730" end="01:19:03.820" style="s2">idea of having little kids around again</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.380" end="01:19:05.770" style="s2">is thrilling because I really like</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.820" end="01:19:09.880" style="s2">little kids they&#39;re really really fun</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.770" end="01:19:12.820" style="s2">and so the the shackle together is more</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.880" end="01:19:13.990" style="s2">like it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s such a I may</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.820" end="01:19:15.700" style="s2">have even said that but it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.990" end="01:19:16.990" style="s2">cynical way of looking at it it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.700" end="01:19:20.620" style="s2">like what you&#39;ve produced is an</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.990" end="01:19:23.080" style="s2">unbreakable bond between two beings and</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.620" end="01:19:25.480" style="s2">that that makes both of them both of</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.080" end="01:19:27.160" style="s2">them better in every way if it&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.480" end="01:19:28.829" style="s2">on if it&#39;s a relationship that&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.160" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">on trust and genuine communicate</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.829" end="01:19:32.790" style="s2">that&#39;s very difficult thing to attain</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:34.110" style="s2">because you have to be willing to tell</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.790" end="01:19:36.840" style="s2">the truth and the truth is DARAB</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.110" end="01:19:38.849" style="s2">generally a horrible thing no I mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.840" end="01:19:40.139" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to tell truth when everyone</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.849" end="01:19:41.699" style="s2">wants to hear what you have to say but</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.139" end="01:19:43.619" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.699" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">when no one wants to hear it least of</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.619" end="01:19:49.650" style="s2">all yourself and so marriage gets a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:51.239" style="s2">bad rap in our culture and so does child</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.650" end="01:19:55.530" style="s2">rearing and I think that&#39;s absolute</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.239" end="01:19:57.420" style="s2">catastrophe because really being in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.530" end="01:19:59.639" style="s2">long-term relationship a marriage let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.420" end="01:20:01.949" style="s2">say and having children that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.639" end="01:20:04.559" style="s2">two-thirds of your life even if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.949" end="01:20:06.090" style="s2">highly career oriented person that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.559" end="01:20:09.510" style="s2">thirds of your life and I&#39;m a highly</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.090" end="01:20:11.489" style="s2">career oriented person and my family has</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.510" end="01:20:13.139" style="s2">been unbelievably important to me and</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.489" end="01:20:15.239" style="s2">has also been something that&#39;s enabled</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.139" end="01:20:16.860" style="s2">me to be a very effective in my career</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.239" end="01:20:19.079" style="s2">because it my house has been a sanctuary</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.860" end="01:20:20.790" style="s2">for me and thank God for that especially</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.079" end="01:20:24.929" style="s2">over many times in my life but</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.790" end="01:20:26.760" style="s2">especially over the last year so you</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.929" end="01:20:30.750" style="s2">should you should get to know someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.760" end="01:20:32.630" style="s2">long enough to know that you too can you</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.750" end="01:20:35.130" style="s2">go tell the truth with each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.630" end="01:20:36.869" style="s2">communicate and negotiate because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.130" end="01:20:38.460" style="s2">most important part of a relationship is</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.869" end="01:20:41.670" style="s2">the fact that you can tell each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.460" end="01:20:43.409" style="s2">the truth and negotiate so how does it</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.670" end="01:20:45.420" style="s2">feel to be viewed as a father figure by</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.409" end="01:20:48.750" style="s2">many people who grew up without one well</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.420" end="01:20:51.150" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an unbelievable honor how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.750" end="01:20:53.340" style="s2">that and that is really what I think I</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.150" end="01:20:56.099" style="s2">think it&#39;s a tremendous honor and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.340" end="01:20:58.650" style="s2">doing absolutely everything I can to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.099" end="01:21:00.570" style="s2">worthy of that and I would like to say</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.650" end="01:21:02.460" style="s2">to all the people out there who grew up</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.570" end="01:21:04.650" style="s2">without a father that&#39;s really too bad</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.460" end="01:21:07.320" style="s2">because you need a father there to</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.650" end="01:21:09.960" style="s2">encourage you that&#39;s what father&#39;s do is</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.320" end="01:21:12.530" style="s2">they encourage they help make you</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.960" end="01:21:14.940" style="s2">courageous and if I can help people</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.530" end="01:21:17.099" style="s2">develop the capacity to be courageous</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.940" end="01:21:20.280" style="s2">and to learn to tell the truth and to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.099" end="01:21:22.739" style="s2">responsible then that&#39;s great I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.280" end="01:21:24.570" style="s2">imagine a better outcome for me and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.739" end="01:21:26.760" style="s2">if people are willing to help me play</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.570" end="01:21:29.280" style="s2">that role and to use what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.760" end="01:21:30.420" style="s2">teaching to guide them in that manner</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.280" end="01:21:32.099" style="s2">then hurray</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.420" end="01:21:35.780" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t possibly imagine a better</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.099" end="01:21:35.780" style="s2">outcome than that so</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.790" end="01:21:40.050" style="s2">how do you formulate good questions</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.100" end="01:21:41.880" style="s2">giving that a well given that a well</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.050" end="01:21:43.590" style="s2">oriented question seems often more</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.880" end="01:21:45.150" style="s2">critical than the answer that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.590" end="01:21:47.460" style="s2">question by the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.150" end="01:21:49.950" style="s2">a lot of what you do to formulate good</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.460" end="01:21:52.200" style="s2">questions is listen like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.950" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">engaged in dialogue with someone and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.200" end="01:21:56.790" style="s2">really listen to what they&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:58.770" style="s2">all you have to do is notice when you</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.790" end="01:22:00.900" style="s2">don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.770" end="01:22:02.760" style="s2">then ask them for a clarification and</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.900" end="01:22:07.350" style="s2">that&#39;s the case when you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.760" end="01:22:09.690" style="s2">the factual world as well you know what</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.350" end="01:22:12.570" style="s2">you do to formulate good questions is</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.690" end="01:22:15.330" style="s2">admit your own ignorance to yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.570" end="01:22:17.490" style="s2">then try to articulate that ignorance as</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.330" end="01:22:19.650" style="s2">clearly and simply as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.490" end="01:22:21.180" style="s2">and so I do that all the time when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.650" end="01:22:23.160" style="s2">in my clinical sessions with people</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.180" end="01:22:25.650" style="s2">because they&#39;ll be telling me the story</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.160" end="01:22:27.420" style="s2">of their life years ago perhaps or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.650" end="01:22:29.340" style="s2">events over the last few weeks or</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.420" end="01:22:32.430" style="s2">whatever and they&#39;ll tell me the story</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.340" end="01:22:34.410" style="s2">and I&#39;ll detect elements of it that I</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.430" end="01:22:36.810" style="s2">don&#39;t understand or that are unclear or</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.410" end="01:22:38.430" style="s2">that seem self contradictory and so then</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.810" end="01:22:39.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll just ask it says well I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.430" end="01:22:41.700" style="s2">don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.810" end="01:22:43.350" style="s2">there you said this as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.700" end="01:22:46.710" style="s2">but that wasn&#39;t clear what exactly do</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.350" end="01:22:48.690" style="s2">you mean and so a huge and get them to</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.710" end="01:22:51.000" style="s2">articulate it and maybe I&#39;ll say well</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.690" end="01:22:52.860" style="s2">you said this now but you said this you</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.000" end="01:22:54.780" style="s2">know ten minutes ago and as far as I can</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.860" end="01:22:58.530" style="s2">tell those two things are opposites and</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.780" end="01:23:00.720" style="s2">so how do you how do you bridge the gap</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.530" end="01:23:02.340" style="s2">between those things and but the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.720" end="01:23:04.050" style="s2">critical issue with regards to good</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.340" end="01:23:05.610" style="s2">questions is that you admit to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.050" end="01:23:06.960" style="s2">your own ignorance and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.610" end="01:23:08.820" style="s2">embarrassed about it like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.960" end="01:23:10.500" style="s2">nothing wrong with being ignorant well</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.820" end="01:23:12.990" style="s2">that&#39;s not true it&#39;s a terrible thing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.500" end="01:23:16.380" style="s2">be ignorant but it&#39;s inevitable but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.990" end="01:23:18.930" style="s2">not a moral flaw it&#39;s just unfortunate</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.380" end="01:23:23.070" style="s2">the moral flaw is in refusing to admit</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.930" end="01:23:24.750" style="s2">to it and so you know the students who</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.070" end="01:23:27.000" style="s2">do really well in classes are the ones</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.750" end="01:23:28.230" style="s2">who ask basic questions they put up</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.000" end="01:23:29.820" style="s2">their hand and say look you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.230" end="01:23:31.500" style="s2">everyone else here seems to understand</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.820" end="01:23:34.890" style="s2">this but this is a point that I really</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.500" end="01:23:36.390" style="s2">don&#39;t get and you know rarely a person</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.890" end="01:23:37.680" style="s2">asks a question like that and they</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.390" end="01:23:39.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t been listening and they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.680" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">been paying attention and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.540" end="01:23:44.160" style="s2">being annoying but most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:45.870" style="s2">people who do that have been paying</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.160" end="01:23:47.130" style="s2">attention and they&#39;re asking question</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.870" end="01:23:48.150" style="s2">that everyone else in the room would</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.130" end="01:23:53.699" style="s2">also like to ask</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.150" end="01:23:55.560" style="s2">is embarrassed to do so so all right hmm</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.699" end="01:23:57.270" style="s2">you&#39;ve said that positive emotion comes</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.560" end="01:23:59.130" style="s2">from moving towards a goal but also that</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.270" end="01:24:00.630" style="s2">friends and family are crucial critical</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.130" end="01:24:02.699" style="s2">to a fulfilling life are both of these</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.630" end="01:24:05.550" style="s2">hitting the same neural circuits I would</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.699" end="01:24:07.230" style="s2">say no not precisely the the positive</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.550" end="01:24:08.820" style="s2">emotion that comes from moving towards a</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.230" end="01:24:11.909" style="s2">goal looks to me to be primarily</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.820" end="01:24:13.679" style="s2">dopaminergic and the the positive</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.909" end="01:24:14.760" style="s2">emotion that&#39;s associated with friends</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.679" end="01:24:16.710" style="s2">and family I think is much more</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.760" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">associated with the opiate system and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.710" end="01:24:22.830" style="s2">some of the best work on that was done</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:25.050" style="s2">by yak panksepp J a a K panksepp PA NK s</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.830" end="01:24:27.060" style="s2">EPP and he wrote a book called affective</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.050" end="01:24:29.400" style="s2">neuroscience and a variety of very very</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.060" end="01:24:31.230" style="s2">good scientific papers and laid some of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.400" end="01:24:33.390" style="s2">the initial groundwork for understanding</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.230" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">the relationship between the functioning</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.390" end="01:24:37.590" style="s2">of the endogenous opiates systems and</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:39.179" style="s2">social bonding so no I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.590" end="01:24:42.179" style="s2">they&#39;re the same there they share</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.179" end="01:24:45.179" style="s2">overlap because the opiate circuits can</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.179" end="01:24:48.030" style="s2">activate the dopaminergic circuits but</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.179" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">but there there are definite differences</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.030" end="01:24:52.770" style="s2">in the system that that that seeks out</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.120" end="01:24:54.300" style="s2">goals and that&#39;s the system that</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.770" end="01:24:55.770" style="s2">panksepp actually called the seeking</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.300" end="01:24:58.199" style="s2">system that&#39;s the dopaminergic system</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.770" end="01:25:00.120" style="s2">and the more affiliative systems so</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.199" end="01:25:06.210" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely overlapping but</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.120" end="01:25:07.830" style="s2">separate neural circuits and so not to</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.210" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">take away from your interpretations but</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.830" end="01:25:11.370" style="s2">for a skeptic how do you know that your</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:13.980" style="s2">analysis of biblical stories are true</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.370" end="01:25:15.719" style="s2">well that&#39;s a great question but the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.980" end="01:25:18.750" style="s2">issue there is what what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.719" end="01:25:21.600" style="s2">true I would say they&#39;re functional</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.750" end="01:25:23.159" style="s2">because I&#39;m a pragmatist you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.600" end="01:25:25.560" style="s2">that technically I believe that our</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.159" end="01:25:27.690" style="s2">conceptual structures are tools to help</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.560" end="01:25:30.239" style="s2">us orient ourselves in the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.690" end="01:25:32.280" style="s2">the issue for me is are the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.239" end="01:25:35.520" style="s2">interpretations that I&#39;m making of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.280" end="01:25:37.650" style="s2">biblical stories useful functional tools</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.520" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">for people to use to operate in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.650" end="01:25:42.690" style="s2">world and how can I demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:43.170" style="s2">their canonical interpretations of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.690" end="01:25:46.140" style="s2">Bible</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.170" end="01:25:47.880" style="s2">well I can&#39;t demonstrate that what I can</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.140" end="01:25:49.350" style="s2">say is that people can listen to them</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.880" end="01:25:51.870" style="s2">and make their own judgment about</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.350" end="01:25:53.250" style="s2">whether or not they&#39;re useful and valid</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.870" end="01:25:56.010" style="s2">which i think is a better way of</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.250" end="01:25:58.560" style="s2">thinking about it then then true because</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.010" end="01:26:01.470" style="s2">truth in literature and mythology is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.560" end="01:26:03.300" style="s2">very tricky concept and especially in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.470" end="01:26:06.090" style="s2">like the Bible which as I pointed out in</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.300" end="01:26:08.460" style="s2">the first biblical lecture is the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.090" end="01:26:11.730" style="s2">truly hyperlinked text where every</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.460" end="01:26:14.730" style="s2">almost every verse interacts with almost</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.730" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">every other verse and so it&#39;s an end</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.730" end="01:26:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s endlessly deep and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:21.300" style="s2">endless number in some sense of valid</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.680" end="01:26:27.270" style="s2">interpretations that could come forth</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.300" end="01:26:29.130" style="s2">from it but there&#39;s more to the answer</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.270" end="01:26:31.560" style="s2">to that question but I can&#39;t go into it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.130" end="01:26:32.550" style="s2">for now because I&#39;m what we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.560" end="01:26:37.410" style="s2">out of time and I&#39;m running out of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.550" end="01:26:39.060" style="s2">energy in fact it is 9:30 and so and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.410" end="01:26:40.740" style="s2">and my daughter has just showed up and</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.060" end="01:26:42.570" style="s2">my wife has told me that so I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.740" end="01:26:45.330" style="s2">actually going to take this opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.570" end="01:26:47.670" style="s2">to bow out and to say once again thank</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.330" end="01:26:53.310" style="s2">you this is my wife by the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.670" end="01:26:54.570" style="s2">might as well wear what I was watching</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.310" end="01:26:57.000" style="s2">the video and I thought she was still in</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.570" end="01:26:58.500" style="s2">the room the videos lagged so I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.000" end="01:27:01.260" style="s2">actually interacting with a ghost there</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.500" end="01:27:03.810" style="s2">for a minute um I wanted to thank you</p>
