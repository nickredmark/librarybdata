<p begin="00:02:37.769" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">book and I&#39;m in other things and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.129" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">interested in how my work can connect in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">ways that are productive with people</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:52.799" style="s2">that are interested I guess in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">consciousness for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.799" end="00:02:57.690" style="s2">so I&#39;m interested in building those</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">bridges and Brent is a great facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.690" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">of that so I want to give props to him</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:06.299" style="s2">and also Jeremy Johnson there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:11.129" style="s2">person in this world that whose work I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.299" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">really appreciate I am a talk show host</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.129" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">essentially and I you know my primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:20.909" style="s2">vehicle is the Michael Brooks show a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:23.129" style="s2">of the focus of that show is on</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.909" end="00:03:26.099" style="s2">international relations on trends in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.129" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">global politics I definitely am coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.099" end="00:03:31.889" style="s2">from sort of of Marxist left looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:35.989" style="s2">things trying to look at things in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.889" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">very material and historical way and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.989" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">figure out a better way of going into</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:44.280" style="s2">the future by actually being much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.959" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">grounded in the past so I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.280" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">the work that I try to do is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.819" style="s2">historically oriented particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:52.139" style="s2">longer forms and more deep dives and one</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.819" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">of the ways it actually intersects with</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.139" end="00:03:57.060" style="s2">the books with the of the book is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:03:59.669" style="s2">in feeling like a lot of kind of pop</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.060" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">intellectual culture right now doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.669" end="00:04:04.079" style="s2">have a historical ground and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:07.099" style="s2">start to have a historical grounding of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.079" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">things we can have a much more dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.099" end="00:04:16.620" style="s2">opportunities for building a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">political culture so yeah so Michael</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.620" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">Brooks show is probably the primary I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">mean that&#39;s my show that&#39;s my vehicle so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:24.389" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the best way to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">track what I&#39;m doing but yeah I also do</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.389" end="00:04:28.889" style="s2">the show with Anna for Jacobin and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:32.030" style="s2">could see me in a bunch of other outlets</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.889" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">with with you know and and I think with</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.030" end="00:04:37.110" style="s2">what some some people might think to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">some kind of contradictory impulses but</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:41.969" style="s2">that&#39;s the synthesis like on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:44.099" style="s2">really trying to make a show that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.969" end="00:04:49.739" style="s2">grounded in a certain type of realism</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.099" end="00:04:51.299" style="s2">and attempt to look at the world as sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.739" end="00:04:54.209" style="s2">of clearly and dispassionately as</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.299" end="00:04:57.869" style="s2">possible in some ways taking power</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.209" end="00:05:00.509" style="s2">really seriously and how power works and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.869" end="00:05:05.069" style="s2">then also at the same time thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.509" end="00:05:07.049" style="s2">we need to get that that&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.069" end="00:05:09.179" style="s2">kind of questions that come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.049" end="00:05:13.079" style="s2">I guess spiritual places are relevant as</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.179" end="00:05:16.049" style="s2">well so sort of like yeah I think what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.079" end="00:05:20.909" style="s2">was some person my show was described</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.049" end="00:05:22.559" style="s2">one time as like was like unwell Cal</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.909" end="00:05:26.999" style="s2">Jazeera yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.559" end="00:05:29.069" style="s2">and or which is interesting Alok</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.999" end="00:05:31.499" style="s2">aljazeera I love al-jazeera what they</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.069" end="00:05:35.959" style="s2">are run you know it&#39;s already monarchy</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.499" end="00:05:39.649" style="s2">or you know marks and Machiavelli meets</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.959" end="00:05:43.019" style="s2">you know Howard Stern and mindfulness so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.649" end="00:05:45.089" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a flavor but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.019" end="00:05:46.379" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m interested in these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.089" end="00:05:48.629" style="s2">conversations that I think could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.379" end="00:05:50.819" style="s2">productive bridge-building yeah so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.629" end="00:05:52.619" style="s2">yeah cuz I mean you just had dr. Cornel</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.819" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">West on and he&#39;s a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.619" end="00:05:55.409" style="s2">Christian and you had a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:57.569" style="s2">conversation about the role of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.409" end="00:05:59.249" style="s2">spirituality and in politics and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.569" end="00:06:01.860" style="s2">fact that I think largely it&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.249" end="00:06:03.449" style="s2">and that that&#39;s something that stood out</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.860" end="00:06:05.879" style="s2">to me that makes you kind of a unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.449" end="00:06:08.249" style="s2">figure on the left to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.879" end="00:06:10.439" style="s2">the spiritual elements of politics but</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.249" end="00:06:12.659" style="s2">before we get into that I&#39;d like you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.439" end="00:06:14.789" style="s2">describe the thesis of your book and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.659" end="00:06:18.719" style="s2">kind of the framework of your criticism</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.789" end="00:06:22.529" style="s2">of the IDW look and in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.719" end="00:06:24.029" style="s2">book I mean you know the please you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.529" end="00:06:26.039" style="s2">should definitely go buy the book it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.029" end="00:06:27.449" style="s2">very good book but I&#39;ll do a confession</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.039" end="00:06:33.179" style="s2">that you know anytime you write a book</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.449" end="00:06:35.459" style="s2">and a privilege and frustration you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.179" end="00:06:38.399" style="s2">go either way of doing live content</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.459" end="00:06:40.379" style="s2">multiple times a week is that on one</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.399" end="00:06:42.629" style="s2">hand I mean you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.379" end="00:06:44.669" style="s2">content out there plenty of room to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.629" end="00:06:48.179" style="s2">mistakes and think you could do things</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.669" end="00:06:51.509" style="s2">better but on the other hand it allows</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.179" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">you to evolve day to day you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.509" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">to me I mean this is a cast</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:59.069" style="s2">characters that I guess I was a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:01.949" style="s2">interested in frankly when I started the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.069" end="00:07:04.590" style="s2">book these folks don&#39;t occupy much of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.949" end="00:07:07.349" style="s2">attention right now but the primary</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.590" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">thing that I was interested in and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.349" end="00:07:11.430" style="s2">when I got contracted to do the book was</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:15.030" style="s2">was one that I felt that these guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.430" end="00:07:17.190" style="s2">definitely were selling an eight</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.030" end="00:07:19.889" style="s2">historical worldview and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.190" end="00:07:24.770" style="s2">big theme for me I I think you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.889" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">pray or hope or anything to understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.770" end="00:07:32.900" style="s2">big questions about the economy about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:35.129" style="s2">why things look the way they look today</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.900" end="00:07:36.900" style="s2">without looking at things in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.129" end="00:07:38.879" style="s2">historical process and I and and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.900" end="00:07:40.680" style="s2">reason that I refer to all of these guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.879" end="00:07:42.419" style="s2">is being somewhere on the right in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.680" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">view even though I get that some of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.419" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">are you know Democrats or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">in a broader sense of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">politics what is your kind of frame you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:54.210" style="s2">know for how you what is your starting</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:58.199" style="s2">point for understanding things right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.210" end="00:08:00.870" style="s2">I think broadly a left project looks at</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.199" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">the material and historical forces as to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.870" end="00:08:04.349" style="s2">why we are where we&#39;re at and how those</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:07.650" style="s2">things are operating and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.349" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">various right-wing projects and by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.650" end="00:08:12.210" style="s2">way in my view there&#39;s some projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:15.479" style="s2">that might appeal appears superficially</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.210" end="00:08:17.340" style="s2">very whoa in quote-unquote progressive</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.479" end="00:08:19.409" style="s2">that actually are quite conservative</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.340" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">because what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.409" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">either naturalize things as a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">process or mythologize things so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:30.569" style="s2">know you look at a lot of these folks</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:32.490" style="s2">and my first big kind of collision with</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.569" end="00:08:38.070" style="s2">these guys with sam Harris&#39;s writing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.490" end="00:08:40.020" style="s2">on islam and you know yeah III guess I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.070" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">had objections that people would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.020" end="00:08:45.029" style="s2">expect on some sort of liberal grounds</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">that I think he was you know kind of me</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.029" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">definitely being an asshole about it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:52.620" style="s2">that there was very troubling</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:54.360" style="s2">implications from a policy perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.620" end="00:08:56.190" style="s2">what he was writing and talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.360" end="00:08:58.250" style="s2">he was writing and advocating but even</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.190" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">more broadly was just the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.250" end="00:09:03.390" style="s2">somebody thought that they could take on</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:08.070" style="s2">such an incredibly complicated terrain</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.390" end="00:09:10.920" style="s2">and I mean like really like stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.070" end="00:09:12.960" style="s2">you could spend as a scholar two or</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.920" end="00:09:15.780" style="s2">three years trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.960" end="00:09:19.340" style="s2">happened in Afghanistan from like 86 to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.780" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">93 as a launching point for maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.340" end="00:09:24.390" style="s2">scratching the surface of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:26.730" style="s2">the rise of a group like Isis and really</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.390" end="00:09:30.990" style="s2">thinking that you could skip over so</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.730" end="00:09:34.020" style="s2">much just reality in history and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.990" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">substitute thought experiments and a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.020" end="00:09:40.680" style="s2">opinion polls and and some quotes from</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">some holy books that that just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.680" end="00:09:46.020" style="s2">offended me intellectually and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.290" end="00:09:47.640" style="s2">that like and then Jordan Peterson came</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.020" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">along and and I think the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.640" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">caught me with Peterson was that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:53.850" style="s2">know and as you said I especially I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:57.840" style="s2">guess for somebody on the left I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.850" end="00:10:00.540" style="s2">allergic to the spiritual stuff for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.840" end="00:10:03.840" style="s2">interest in mythology I thought his</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.540" end="00:10:05.220" style="s2">basic framework was kind of boring and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.840" end="00:10:07.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t think it was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">convincing but I thought what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.860" end="00:10:12.750" style="s2">interesting about him and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:15.450" style="s2">leads to the what made the book more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.750" end="00:10:17.670" style="s2">exciting for me to write was that he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.450" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">speaking to so many serious and urgent</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.670" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">needs and I think he was you know miss</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">diagnosing them I you know again I</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:27.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t find his product the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:29.970" style="s2">chapter on him in the book is the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.180" end="00:10:31.800" style="s2">who didn&#39;t do his homework so that gives</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.970" end="00:10:35.070" style="s2">you a sense of where I&#39;m coming from in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.800" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">terms of of you know my sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.070" end="00:10:38.250" style="s2">impressed I am with his work but he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">talking about serious stuff he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.250" end="00:10:41.370" style="s2">about alienation he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">lack of meaning he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:46.080" style="s2">really really urgent things and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:49.590" style="s2">response from the sort of conventional</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.080" end="00:10:50.910" style="s2">liberal sort of media was just to kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.590" end="00:10:52.020" style="s2">of point out the ways in which he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.910" end="00:10:54.150" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.020" end="00:10:55.830" style="s2">empirically or historically which you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.150" end="00:10:57.960" style="s2">know fair enough he gets a lot wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.830" end="00:11:00.510" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about it you know he</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.960" end="00:11:03.570" style="s2">confuses Marxism with post-modernism in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.510" end="00:11:06.030" style="s2">a way that like honestly like any intro</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.570" end="00:11:09.090" style="s2">to history of philosophy class would</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.030" end="00:11:11.820" style="s2">clear up for you but that wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.090" end="00:11:15.150" style="s2">the point the point was the themes he</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.820" end="00:11:17.780" style="s2">was speaking to and and if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.150" end="00:11:20.730" style="s2">have a way of addressing those needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.780" end="00:11:22.200" style="s2">then you know we would just be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.730" end="00:11:24.180" style="s2">you know failed more</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.200" end="00:11:25.620" style="s2">lasers which is oftentimes so much of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.180" end="00:11:29.250" style="s2">what kind of liberal politics basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.620" end="00:11:31.830" style="s2">is and so I got interested in the book</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.250" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">in terms of okay how can I answer what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.830" end="00:11:36.210" style="s2">think the mistakes these guys are making</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.430" style="s2">in ways that are bigger than them</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.210" end="00:11:40.200" style="s2">because I think that the models that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.430" end="00:11:42.960" style="s2">they&#39;re using that even if they go away</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.200" end="00:11:44.910" style="s2">which they kind of have they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.960" end="00:11:47.940" style="s2">gonna be replicated in other ways this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.910" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">kind of impulse to take big complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.940" end="00:11:54.600" style="s2">problems and reduce them down to simple</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.190" style="s2">stories then I was also but then I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.600" end="00:11:57.450" style="s2">was like yeah I mean clearly I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.190" end="00:12:00.210" style="s2">part of the reason they have so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.450" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">resonance is because people in the sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.210" end="00:12:04.950" style="s2">of pop intellectual culture who</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:06.690" style="s2">represent the quote-unquote left don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.950" end="00:12:07.890" style="s2">have very compelling answers to some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:11.670" style="s2">these things and they have their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.890" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">sort of boring repetitive moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.670" end="00:12:18.830" style="s2">narratives and so I I kind of saw it as</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:21.720" style="s2">an opportunity to address them and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.830" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">create what I think is a much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.720" end="00:12:29.490" style="s2">compelling and dynamic and appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">for being in such a globalized time kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.490" end="00:12:32.610" style="s2">of vision of what the left could be so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.140" end="00:12:36.360" style="s2">that that&#39;s what the book was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.610" end="00:12:41.460" style="s2">do excellent and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.360" end="00:12:42.180" style="s2">thank you yeah well yeah I enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.460" end="00:12:44.190" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.180" end="00:12:45.660" style="s2">and I found that I think I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.190" end="00:12:47.010" style="s2">you in the sense that you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.660" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">get into a group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.010" end="00:12:51.210" style="s2">especially in response to a historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:52.980" style="s2">event which I think that the culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.210" end="00:12:55.050" style="s2">wars and what was happening on campuses</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.980" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">generally was like there was people on</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.050" end="00:12:59.520" style="s2">the Left who were involved in things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">then suddenly this these this activity</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.520" end="00:13:05.070" style="s2">started and it started to kind of split</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:07.950" style="s2">right in in left leftist politics and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.070" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">meta modernism and in other groups of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.950" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">people in this in this world and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:14.700" style="s2">of people went reactionary alongside the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">IDW so one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.700" end="00:13:20.280" style="s2">curious about is now that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">hype I think has passed generally and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.280" end="00:13:24.960" style="s2">now we&#39;re being pressed upon with more</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">existential threats I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.960" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">feeling that politics is is important is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.690" end="00:13:31.590" style="s2">really coming to the fore even for</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:33.870" style="s2">people who thought that maybe they could</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.590" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">be apolitical during this time what</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.870" end="00:13:38.139" style="s2">would you say to people who went</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:40.060" style="s2">reactionary during this phase in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.139" end="00:13:43.029" style="s2">to bring them into what I think you call</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.260" end="00:17:28.820" style="s2">getting into a big debate about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">Soviet Union and what it was and all of</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">the proper reading of Marx is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.420" end="00:17:40.730" style="s2">a fulfillment of an expansion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:43.220" style="s2">democracy project the idea was that just</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.730" end="00:17:45.130" style="s2">as the sort of Divine Right of Kings was</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.220" end="00:17:48.950" style="s2">interrogated in the political realm</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.130" end="00:17:50.630" style="s2">people need a great deal of more agency</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.950" end="00:17:53.270" style="s2">and power over their own economic lives</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.630" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">and and and you know the events of 1917</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.270" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">are extraordinary I mean that level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.940" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">public participation and energy for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:02.210" style="s2">idea that you&#39;re going to get rid of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:03.890" style="s2">feudal system</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.210" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">and also get rid of kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.890" end="00:18:08.090" style="s2">discredited parliamentary you know not</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.800" end="00:18:10.610" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t still have a democracy</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.090" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">but that you would have a substantive</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.610" end="00:18:16.430" style="s2">democracy is is dynamic and important</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:18.110" style="s2">and so the argument of the book is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.430" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">really that the IDW and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.110" end="00:18:22.070" style="s2">right-wing politics represents different</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.970" end="00:18:24.410" style="s2">there and a lot of our world politics</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.070" end="00:18:27.140" style="s2">today represents a conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.410" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">Singapore and hungry and we need more</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.140" end="00:18:32.360" style="s2">Finland and so I I think two people</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:34.730" style="s2">who&#39;ve been really caught in the IDW I</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.360" end="00:18:37.330" style="s2">guess and and kind of reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.730" end="00:18:41.530" style="s2">politics I guess I would say on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.330" end="00:18:45.620" style="s2">that&#39;s made me more inviting is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.530" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">there you can tune into a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.620" end="00:18:50.810" style="s2">world of politics today and find much</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:53.180" style="s2">more dynamic and compelling answers and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.810" end="00:18:55.730" style="s2">maybe some of the things that put you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.180" end="00:18:58.040" style="s2">off to kind of pop liberal discourse</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.730" end="00:19:00.590" style="s2">that that these kind of too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.040" end="00:19:03.290" style="s2">things are not the choice it isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.590" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2">know you don&#39;t have to listen to IDW</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.409" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">is in the 1990s there was a really big</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.620" end="00:21:17.570" style="s2">debate on something called Asian values</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:20.269" style="s2">and these were countries that actually</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:50.539" style="s2">no that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.130" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">we have our own conception of human</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.289" end="00:22:06.350" style="s2">was at Oxford at the time and he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.840" style="s2">you know this is a ludicrous debate</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.350" end="00:22:12.279" style="s2">because the the Western chauvinists are</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.279" end="00:22:19.730" style="s2">again in this a historical flow like</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:21.830" style="s2">from Socrates to Clinton we came up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.730" end="00:22:24.590" style="s2">human rights we came up with democracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.830" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">we nailed it everybody should just copy</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.590" end="00:22:28.140" style="s2">us and then these Asian values leaders</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.800" style="s2">and actually what you can do is you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.590" end="00:22:39.750" style="s2">easily have a reading of Confucianism or</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.800" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">Indian philosophy or African you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.750" end="00:22:44.820" style="s2">that that&#39;s that talked about holding</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.220" end="00:22:55.020" style="s2">human rights so the sort of answer was</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.300" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">a lot of these arguments track today on</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.450" end="00:23:17.340" style="s2">again is a historical and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:19.320" style="s2">in 2020 it&#39;s showing in the 1990s it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.340" end="00:23:21.930" style="s2">triumphant in 2020 it&#39;s very insecure</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.320" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">because China&#39;s rising and this just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.930" end="00:23:25.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit with the world as it works</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:29.400" style="s2">and looks today</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.080" end="00:23:32.160" style="s2">but then on both the populous right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:34.290" style="s2">this neo nationalism where there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:51.060" style="s2">on parts the left that pushed so far</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.040" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">into identitarian politics that from us</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.060" end="00:23:56.340" style="s2">from like standpoint epistemology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">like we can never we can never overlap</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.340" end="00:24:01.260" style="s2">on anything because our experiences are</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:05.460" style="s2">too different so all we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.260" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">sit on platform capitalist platforms of</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.860" end="00:24:20.730" style="s2">so I thought sin was so relevant and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.060" end="00:24:23.160" style="s2">connected it with my own really strong</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:59.429" style="s2">can&#39;t just dismiss that but then on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.659" end="00:25:01.770" style="s2">other hand we actually need to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.429" end="00:25:03.450" style="s2">idea that in fact there are Universal</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.770" end="00:25:05.850" style="s2">commonalities there are similarities</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.610" end="00:25:13.890" style="s2">recognize that is by actually being</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.679" end="00:25:16.590" style="s2">truly global in that sense so that</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:36.299" style="s2">but until somebody asks a question I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.350" end="00:25:37.830" style="s2">wanted to ask you so we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.299" end="00:25:39.960" style="s2">like this kind of universal value which</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.830" end="00:25:41.399" style="s2">of course goes against the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.960" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">post-modernism so you can&#39;t really lump</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.399" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">you into a postmodern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">because we have this idea that but also</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:53.370" style="s2">that this idea of Human Rights shows up</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.410" style="s2">South Africa table and Becky who was</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:38.060" style="s2">talking about that when he was</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.410" end="00:27:39.470" style="s2">organizing in Europe as the information</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.060" end="00:27:41.900" style="s2">minister for the African National</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:46.610" style="s2">really striking being in Ireland because</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.170" end="00:27:48.740" style="s2">he would see you know he would</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.610" end="00:27:51.500" style="s2">he was like yeah we needed everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.740" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">you know help and it was great but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.500" end="00:27:56.270" style="s2">conversation in London was different you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:59.270" style="s2">know in Dublin they had books for me to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.270" end="00:28:01.250" style="s2">read that were relevant for how we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.270" end="00:28:03.020" style="s2">building our own strategies and I and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.250" end="00:28:06.410" style="s2">that to me is is incredibly inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.020" end="00:28:11.330" style="s2">but even beyond that I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.410" end="00:28:12.920" style="s2">could point to you know if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.330" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">we&#39;re in a process of an addition not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.920" end="00:28:18.010" style="s2">subtraction I think people&#39;s ways of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:20.210" style="s2">relating and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.010" end="00:28:21.950" style="s2">existentially and and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.210" end="00:28:25.430" style="s2">individual community could be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.950" end="00:28:27.830" style="s2">so that to me does point to the validity</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.430" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">of being open to spiritual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.830" end="00:28:34.250" style="s2">and how they interact with people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">approach to politics and and and those</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.250" end="00:28:38.330" style="s2">and those quests that we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:40.490" style="s2">about so I I think it&#39;s possible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.330" end="00:28:44.810" style="s2">I I also don&#39;t also will say like I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.490" end="00:28:51.670" style="s2">think post-modernism has become kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.810" end="00:28:54.560" style="s2">a stand-in for you know the the work of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.670" end="00:28:56.810" style="s2">questioning power narratives and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.560" end="00:28:58.280" style="s2">things get naturalized it isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.810" end="00:29:00.340" style="s2">that isn&#39;t the primary home of my</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.280" end="00:29:04.010" style="s2">politics but I could tell you that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.340" end="00:29:05.330" style="s2">know if you had to read Foucault love</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.010" end="00:29:07.160" style="s2">him or hate him or dairy</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.330" end="00:29:09.470" style="s2">whenever in college you pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.160" end="00:29:11.030" style="s2">got that this wasn&#39;t the same as</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.470" end="00:29:13.790" style="s2">somebody going you that&#39;s just like your</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.030" end="00:29:17.810" style="s2">opinion man like it&#39;s very demanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.790" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">stuff so I do want to note that too and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.810" end="00:29:21.860" style="s2">I actually think another thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:24.110" style="s2">being reacted to that I guess in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.860" end="00:29:25.700" style="s2">bunch like Harris really exemplifies</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.110" end="00:29:27.860" style="s2">even though he has this kind of funny</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.700" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">you know he&#39;s a promoter of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.860" end="00:29:35.240" style="s2">but I I think a very like flatland</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:37.690" style="s2">approach to reality that has no</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.240" end="00:29:40.130" style="s2">distinction making when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.690" end="00:29:42.260" style="s2">certainly spirituality and religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.130" end="00:29:44.870" style="s2">right that it&#39;s all just quote/unquote</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.260" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">untrue and that&#39;s all you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.870" end="00:29:49.880" style="s2">and that got to me again just even sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.730" style="s2">of anthropologically I don&#39;t like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.880" end="00:29:56.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know what what does the truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.730" end="00:29:59.660" style="s2">claims of the Bible have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.990" end="00:30:02.630" style="s2">liberation of theology in the Union</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.660" end="00:30:04.910" style="s2">Building in San Bernardino like it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.630" end="00:30:08.060" style="s2">totally irrelevant and it shrinks your</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.910" end="00:30:10.430" style="s2">worldview in in really disastrous ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.060" end="00:30:14.510" style="s2">for you know understanding how things</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.430" end="00:30:15.800" style="s2">work great thank you for the answer</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.510" end="00:30:20.600" style="s2">Peter would you like to and meet</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.800" end="00:30:22.790" style="s2">yourself yeah so let me see how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.600" end="00:30:25.000" style="s2">gonna formulate this a question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.790" end="00:30:28.940" style="s2">around sort of like strategy outreach</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.000" end="00:30:30.590" style="s2">for political ideas and as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.940" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">in the beginning Brent&#39;s always on my</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.590" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">case like Peter you got the more</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">political that more political and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:39.080" style="s2">guess he&#39;s right in this thinking it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:42.250" style="s2">just listening to you speak it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.080" end="00:30:45.470" style="s2">lot of this feels above my paygrade</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.250" end="00:30:47.180" style="s2">right and I know if I did my homework if</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.470" end="00:30:48.740" style="s2">I just sat down and just like read it</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.180" end="00:30:51.140" style="s2">I&#39;m like yeah yeah I could I could rock</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.740" end="00:30:52.790" style="s2">it and just thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.140" end="00:30:55.010" style="s2">resistance I have to even want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.790" end="00:30:56.870" style="s2">in politics it&#39;s like what you said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.010" end="00:30:58.220" style="s2">like there&#39;s like it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.870" end="00:31:00.470" style="s2">trying to manipulate my emotions all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.220" end="00:31:02.750" style="s2">times like this scintillating like on</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.470" end="00:31:03.980" style="s2">the the social justice warriors shaming</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.750" end="00:31:05.930" style="s2">you for being a white male than the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.980" end="00:31:08.180" style="s2">intellectual dork web attacking you for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.930" end="00:31:10.370" style="s2">this or that for not being based enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.180" end="00:31:11.300" style="s2">and I just like okay fuck off you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.370" end="00:31:13.820" style="s2">just do this go away</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.300" end="00:31:15.530" style="s2">like in my stoicism kicks in and my reps</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.820" end="00:31:18.170" style="s2">there and I just wanna case of distance</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:19.190" style="s2">I think in that act it&#39;s like I almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.170" end="00:31:21.050" style="s2">the whole cat</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.190" end="00:31:24.770" style="s2">Corie of politics I push away and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.050" end="00:31:26.780" style="s2">don&#39;t want to engage in it so I guess to</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.770" end="00:31:29.000" style="s2">tease out a question there is how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.780" end="00:31:30.350" style="s2">ethical ego about talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.000" end="00:31:32.090" style="s2">very important issues that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.350" end="00:31:34.100" style="s2">talking about in such a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.090" end="00:31:36.140" style="s2">attractive to people like me and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.100" end="00:31:37.910" style="s2">imagine someone who&#39;s met have a met</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.140" end="00:31:40.250" style="s2">awareness of this a lot of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.910" end="00:31:42.050" style="s2">don&#39;t so I guess what is your current</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.250" end="00:31:44.420" style="s2">strategy or what is a good strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.050" end="00:31:46.550" style="s2">go about that well I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.420" end="00:31:50.090" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s ever-evolving right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.550" end="00:31:52.130" style="s2">and also you don&#39;t know I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.090" end="00:31:54.170" style="s2">the things that&#39;s funny to me about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.130" end="00:31:56.150" style="s2">whole terrain is like you know again I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.170" end="00:31:58.460" style="s2">mean you see this with I guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.150" end="00:32:01.010" style="s2">some of these IDW characters and all day</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.460" end="00:32:02.840" style="s2">like oh like don&#39;t be a snowflake and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.010" end="00:32:04.820" style="s2">meanwhile you know oh my god you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.840" end="00:32:07.100" style="s2">criticize the guy but I liked his books</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.820" end="00:32:09.410" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have like a three weeks mental</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.100" end="00:32:11.990" style="s2">breakdown and you know harass you on</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.410" end="00:32:15.340" style="s2">Twitter so I think we got that I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.990" end="00:32:15.340" style="s2">you actually have to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.700" end="00:32:25.580" style="s2">form and substance right so you know and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.090" end="00:32:28.310" style="s2">and again I don&#39;t really I I find that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:30.650" style="s2">sort of like very basic pop cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.310" end="00:32:32.600" style="s2">politics debate to be incredibly boring</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.650" end="00:32:34.160" style="s2">and there are moments where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.600" end="00:32:37.790" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know what to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.160" end="00:32:41.290" style="s2">like arguing about nonsense and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.790" end="00:32:45.320" style="s2">things that are going to actually drive</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.290" end="00:32:47.870" style="s2">and are driving our world today whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.320" end="00:32:50.150" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about pandemics or 5g or</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.870" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">arms control or you having healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.150" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">like you know there is that phrase of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:56.210" style="s2">like politics is interested in you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:32:59.000" style="s2">regardless of whether you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.210" end="00:33:01.160" style="s2">in it so I think you have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.000" end="00:33:04.780" style="s2">really big distinction there then I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.160" end="00:33:14.680" style="s2">think you know I&#39;d make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.780" end="00:33:14.680" style="s2">between you know a mediocre</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.980" end="00:33:19.430" style="s2">representation of ideas that might have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:22.040" style="s2">some validity and some relevance versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.430" end="00:33:24.860" style="s2">something that is just sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.040" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">hacky and redundant but you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.860" end="00:33:28.520" style="s2">know as far as as far as communicating</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">these ideas it&#39;s very difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.520" end="00:33:32.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve as an example</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve had feedback from some people that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.909" end="00:33:37.080" style="s2">say like oh you got me much more engaged</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.340" end="00:33:41.340" style="s2">in politics in fact you changed my</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.080" end="00:33:43.529" style="s2">politics because the show is</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:45.929" style="s2">intellectually open and whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.529" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">it&#39;s also funny it also has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.929" end="00:33:52.440" style="s2">attitude to it it&#39;s also in entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:53.999" style="s2">I see other people who you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.440" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">know I did some impression of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.999" end="00:33:59.399" style="s2">Peterson like 18 months ago and they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:03.539" style="s2">unable to watch an interview with Cornel</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.399" end="00:34:07.399" style="s2">West they&#39;re so emotionally distraught</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.539" end="00:34:10.589" style="s2">by that and so you know in my own</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.399" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">process it&#39;s a it&#39;s a dialectic you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.589" end="00:34:16.679" style="s2">sometimes I get the feedback feedback</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:18.149" style="s2">around you know sort of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.679" end="00:34:20.309" style="s2">saying and my response is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.149" end="00:34:21.690" style="s2">ironically it&#39;s kind of just like Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.309" end="00:34:24.059" style="s2">dude I don&#39;t know what to say man up</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.690" end="00:34:26.250" style="s2">like read a fucking book like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.059" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2">should not be so like heavy it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.250" end="00:34:32.280" style="s2">be so like emotionally dramatic like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:34.409" style="s2">take some of that stoicism and write out</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.280" end="00:34:36.270" style="s2">a few uncomfortable conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.409" end="00:34:40.379" style="s2">get engaged in this stuff like read the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.270" end="00:34:44.190" style="s2">Financial Times this is real and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.379" end="00:34:45.960" style="s2">know it extremely real and then on you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.190" end="00:34:51.240" style="s2">know on the other hand I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.960" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">cognizant and very aware that so much</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.240" end="00:34:56.520" style="s2">communication from from both honestly</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:34:59.640" style="s2">you know politics that are just not my</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.520" end="00:35:01.829" style="s2">politics but I recognize will get put in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.640" end="00:35:04.109" style="s2">the sort of same basket but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.829" end="00:35:07.109" style="s2">my politics and even people with you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.109" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">know with my politics there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.109" end="00:35:14.819" style="s2">folks that are absolutely brilliant and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:17.280" style="s2">incredible but you know it&#39;s either the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.819" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">you know it requires like a theory like</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.280" end="00:35:22.530" style="s2">a serious theoretical background to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.640" style="s2">engage with or it&#39;s just kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.530" end="00:35:26.460" style="s2">know it just isn&#39;t immediately</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.640" end="00:35:28.650" style="s2">accessible and so I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.460" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">really valid concerns and I&#39;m not always</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.650" end="00:35:35.579" style="s2">sure how to address them I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:37.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to think of one aspect is can</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.579" end="00:35:40.470" style="s2">the stuff be fun and entertaining the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.490" end="00:35:42.599" style="s2">other aspect is what can I learn from</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.470" end="00:35:44.390" style="s2">somebody like Cornel West in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.599" end="00:35:46.279" style="s2">just like the energy of the precinct</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.390" end="00:35:48.559" style="s2">you know he&#39;s like a really big hero of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.279" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">mine although also I do think with some</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.559" end="00:35:52.450" style="s2">of these people whether it&#39;s Mike about</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:55.220" style="s2">Cornell west or Loula or whatever I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.450" end="00:35:56.809" style="s2">you know we can apprentice these people</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.220" end="00:35:58.700" style="s2">but that&#39;s gonna come with age you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.809" end="00:36:03.170" style="s2">like you&#39;re never gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.700" end="00:36:05.749" style="s2">project that kind of like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.170" end="00:36:07.910" style="s2">you there&#39;s so much work that that needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.749" end="00:36:09.349" style="s2">to be done internally and externally but</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.910" end="00:36:11.989" style="s2">you can you know I can model the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.349" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">and then that third you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.989" end="00:36:19.700" style="s2">think I think people I think people I</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">think bringing people in through you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.700" end="00:36:23.779" style="s2">know again I&#39;ll mention Lula you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:24.890" style="s2">think people have gotten a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.779" end="00:36:27.739" style="s2">understanding some things that were</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.890" end="00:36:30.920" style="s2">happening in Brazil through this heroic</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.739" end="00:36:33.920" style="s2">story and you know it&#39;s a story of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.920" end="00:36:37.249" style="s2">person that opens up a big pneumatic</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:39.349" style="s2">range and you know the last thing I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.249" end="00:36:40.700" style="s2">say is I definitely on my show and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.349" end="00:36:43.249" style="s2">definitely what I&#39;m trying to push</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.700" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">people towards are you know people like</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.249" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">Adolf Reid who&#39;s a huge influence on me</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:50.920" style="s2">you have massive respect for it and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:53.509" style="s2">know his writing on essentialism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.920" end="00:36:55.690" style="s2">economics and identitarian politics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.509" end="00:36:56.989" style="s2">like it isn&#39;t even just that it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.690" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">neither</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.989" end="00:37:01.519" style="s2">I guess the SJW stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:04.789" style="s2">responding to or this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.519" end="00:37:07.640" style="s2">embarrassing IDW stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.789" end="00:37:09.140" style="s2">actual politics it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.640" end="00:37:11.509" style="s2">it&#39;s not only as a trend sending that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.140" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">today that&#39;s like a couple of sophomores</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.509" end="00:37:16.130" style="s2">in high school throwing food at each</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:19.819" style="s2">other and I&#39;m recommending that you read</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.130" end="00:37:22.009" style="s2">like a seasoned labor organizer and pen</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.819" end="00:37:25.099" style="s2">professor who has developed a model</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.009" end="00:37:26.690" style="s2">since like the 60s that really makes a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.099" end="00:37:28.519" style="s2">lot of sense and is very historically</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.690" end="00:37:30.799" style="s2">grounded so I think some of it is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.519" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">and and maybe I take some patience but</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.799" end="00:37:34.999" style="s2">some of that stuff is you know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.190" style="s2">stuff is demanding it isn&#39;t just like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.999" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">Twitter argument right let&#39;s require to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.190" end="00:37:44.450" style="s2">read things but it&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">rewarding yeah so like um here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:49.519" style="s2">assessment let me know if you think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">got it correct and I see I see too like</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.519" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">Michael Brooks and I know when I lose in</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.579" style="s2">our kind of mutual hero Cornel West in</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.720" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">the moment but there&#39;s one that like</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.579" end="00:37:58.099" style="s2">right now there&#39;s like your arguments</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:00.349" style="s2">are credibly</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.099" end="00:38:01.759" style="s2">cogent your coherent like this fucking</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.349" end="00:38:03.739" style="s2">tight and you don&#39;t want to fuck with</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.759" end="00:38:06.680" style="s2">you in a debate hit so that&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.739" end="00:38:11.390" style="s2">saw with it was Sargon and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.680" end="00:38:13.099" style="s2">there&#39;s and then there&#39;s there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.390" end="00:38:14.359" style="s2">kind of like that that devilish michael</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.099" end="00:38:15.979" style="s2">brooks come up with like sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.359" end="00:38:17.509" style="s2">comes at the same harris his name comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.979" end="00:38:19.160" style="s2">up you just fucking like go off there</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.509" end="00:38:21.109" style="s2">upon him and i kind of like it too</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.160" end="00:38:24.619" style="s2">because you know he kind of uh annoys me</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.109" end="00:38:26.509" style="s2">a little bit but like you said they said</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.619" end="00:38:28.460" style="s2">there&#39;s like there&#39;s like a bifurcation</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.509" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">because there&#39;s people who like sam</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.460" end="00:38:30.920" style="s2">harris like a pair of social</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:32.329" style="s2">relationship that they had with him and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.920" end="00:38:33.529" style="s2">they could get triggered in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.329" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">way or they might get seduced the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.529" end="00:38:37.069" style="s2">way and I see you just being authentic I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.589" style="s2">just see you being you and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.069" end="00:38:41.930" style="s2">these two personalities but you like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.589" end="00:38:44.630" style="s2">said our mutual hero West like like</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.930" end="00:38:46.579" style="s2">Trump is ideological component brother</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.630" end="00:38:48.349" style="s2">Trump like the guy is like just you feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.579" end="00:38:52.309" style="s2">his ideas are coming from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.349" end="00:38:55.099" style="s2">love and so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.309" end="00:38:56.779" style="s2">question here but like I guess how do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.099" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">be more like West or how do we get guys</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.779" end="00:39:02.329" style="s2">like West to be more influential less</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:06.680" style="s2">this pretty influential but right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.329" end="00:39:08.809" style="s2">I think the the the the tricking what</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.680" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">you&#39;re saying though and again this is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.809" end="00:39:14.150" style="s2">funny thing because I see this both you</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:16.279" style="s2">know certainly in a lot of places on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.150" end="00:39:18.710" style="s2">Left like oh I can&#39;t you be nice you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.279" end="00:39:21.099" style="s2">know or whatever and I see this in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.710" end="00:39:25.519" style="s2">of places on the on the right frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.099" end="00:39:27.619" style="s2">mean Cornel West it isn&#39;t just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.519" end="00:39:29.869" style="s2">Donald Trump is his ideological opponent</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.619" end="00:39:31.969" style="s2">he says he&#39;s a fascist and a gangster</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.869" end="00:39:36.589" style="s2">and a existential threat to humanity I</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.969" end="00:39:39.259" style="s2">mean this guy is so clear and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.589" end="00:39:41.269" style="s2">his spiritual practice of deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.259" end="00:39:44.150" style="s2">recognizing a shared humanity with even</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.269" end="00:39:47.479" style="s2">the worst of us so I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.150" end="00:39:50.029" style="s2">what Cornel West is doing and in my and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.479" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">what I will aspire to do and fall short</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.029" end="00:39:55.099" style="s2">on constantly definitionally is a space</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:39:57.079" style="s2">that is completely missing from these</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.099" end="00:39:59.499" style="s2">conversations and we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.079" end="00:40:04.249" style="s2">a way to build which is on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.499" end="00:40:06.499" style="s2">there is a soft indulgent culture that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.249" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">is not at all exclusive to the left I</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.499" end="00:40:11.660" style="s2">see it in every space where people</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">cannot deal with criticism</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.660" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">they can&#39;t deal with rigor they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:20.650" style="s2">deal with having their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:24.760" style="s2">interrogated and then conversely I</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.650" end="00:40:27.890" style="s2">people completely dehumanize each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.760" end="00:40:31.700" style="s2">to the point where I actually start to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.890" end="00:40:33.740" style="s2">see why the stakes feel so intense</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.700" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">because if you were if we actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.740" end="00:40:39.380" style="s2">culture where we recognize that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:42.350" style="s2">all human beings who have made mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.380" end="00:40:46.060" style="s2">we&#39;ll make mistakes maybe sometimes even</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.060" end="00:40:52.370" style="s2">that there was a process around</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.110" end="00:40:54.230" style="s2">evolution and rebuilding instead of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.370" end="00:40:55.790" style="s2">tearing down and destruction I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.230" end="00:40:59.320" style="s2">people&#39;s anxiety levels will go down a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.790" end="00:41:02.510" style="s2">lot more so I you know I I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.320" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a really hard process and this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.510" end="00:41:05.810" style="s2">something that I&#39;m thinking about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.800" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2">more recently I don&#39;t exactly know how</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.810" end="00:41:13.460" style="s2">to engage with it but I will say I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.650" end="00:41:15.470" style="s2">noticed people people skip the sides of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.460" end="00:41:17.780" style="s2">the equation like some people say like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.470" end="00:41:19.670" style="s2">oh you know Cornel West kills him with</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.780" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">kindness and it&#39;s so great the way he</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.670" end="00:41:23.630" style="s2">called somebody a brother before he like</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.130" style="s2">rips them and it you know and beats the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.630" end="00:41:27.050" style="s2">shit out of them and then spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.130" end="00:41:28.730" style="s2">people are like oh man it&#39;s so great the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.050" end="00:41:30.380" style="s2">way he does that it&#39;s like he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.730" end="00:41:32.600" style="s2">both yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.380" end="00:41:35.150" style="s2">and he&#39;s really doing both and so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.600" end="00:41:38.750" style="s2">think the question is is you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.150" end="00:41:41.870" style="s2">we cultivate a culture that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.750" end="00:41:43.310" style="s2">both and maybe honestly I you know I do</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.870" end="00:41:46.310" style="s2">think some of these social media</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.310" end="00:41:49.310" style="s2">platforms you know not necessarily I</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.310" end="00:41:51.590" style="s2">think obviously being able to do a show</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.310" end="00:41:54.380" style="s2">in these new podcasts and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.590" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">vehicles or whatever is incredibly lucky</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.380" end="00:42:00.620" style="s2">and interesting it has its own problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:02.360" style="s2">but I do think the kind of I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.620" end="00:42:05.330" style="s2">ever think there&#39;s any way of generating</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.360" end="00:42:09.050" style="s2">a healthy Twitter discourse as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.330" end="00:42:11.330" style="s2">example I think it really does lend</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.050" end="00:42:14.510" style="s2">itself to exactly the wrong kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.330" end="00:42:16.730" style="s2">incentive structure so yeah I think you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.510" end="00:42:18.680" style="s2">know look and I can totally say with</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.730" end="00:42:20.840" style="s2">regards to San Harris like I you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.680" end="00:42:23.870" style="s2">and again I find this to be another</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.840" end="00:42:25.339" style="s2">interesting tension I don&#39;t like him</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.870" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.339" end="00:42:32.539" style="s2">I find the world view the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.489" style="s2">you know I think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.539" end="00:42:36.920" style="s2">incredibly mediocre and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.489" end="00:42:40.269" style="s2">attached to like an extraordinary kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.920" end="00:42:43.729" style="s2">of arrogance I don&#39;t like it but I also</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.269" end="00:42:45.769" style="s2">of course I definitely had to ask myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.729" end="00:42:49.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the answers are you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.769" end="00:42:51.859" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know why that pisses me off</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.700" end="00:42:55.130" style="s2">so much at times though you know again</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.859" end="00:42:57.229" style="s2">already I&#39;m sure the way I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.130" end="00:42:58.849" style="s2">these guys today is different than I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.229" end="00:43:01.029" style="s2">talked about them in two years ago maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.849" end="00:43:05.239" style="s2">even a year ago as I&#39;m in my own process</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.029" end="00:43:07.309" style="s2">so I think that if you want that Cornel</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.239" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">West face it&#39;s gonna embrace a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.309" end="00:43:13.190" style="s2">interesting contradiction because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">gonna involve so much more actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.190" end="00:43:18.499" style="s2">tolerance and so much more actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:20.529" style="s2">ability but then and and forgiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.499" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">open this but it&#39;s also going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.529" end="00:43:25.099" style="s2">lot more rigorous I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:27.619" style="s2">things in that interview that was so fun</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.099" end="00:43:30.559" style="s2">that he did was you know he was praising</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.619" end="00:43:32.690" style="s2">my book which was blowing my mind and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.559" end="00:43:34.130" style="s2">had this great line which I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.690" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">how many people caught but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.130" end="00:43:40.190" style="s2">this beautiful slight dig at the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:41.779" style="s2">I&#39;m writing about and that me raised</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.190" end="00:43:43.640" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s a great book he goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.779" end="00:43:47.450" style="s2">you know these aren&#39;t the most profound</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.640" end="00:43:49.249" style="s2">brothers that you talk on beautiful like</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:44.990" style="s2">like the meditation stuff and whatnot</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.240" end="00:45:25.520" style="s2">anticipated and and said a lot so I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:27.470" style="s2">kind of a bridge my question but if I</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.520" end="00:45:29.750" style="s2">may to address Peters question about</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.470" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">politics I just wanted to say like like</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.750" end="00:45:34.700" style="s2">in my view it&#39;s not about knowing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">horse to back because that&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.700" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s about knowing what correct policies</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:43.100" style="s2">to advocate for first and then knowing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:45.500" style="s2">which horse to back to deliver them</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.100" end="00:45:49.430" style="s2">right so in that context like it should</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.500" end="00:45:51.710" style="s2">be clear like Medicare for all is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.430" end="00:45:55.400" style="s2">debatable right because health care is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.710" end="00:45:56.780" style="s2">human right mm um so my question was</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.400" end="00:46:01.430" style="s2">along the lines of you know how we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.780" end="00:46:05.120" style="s2">do better and this session is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.430" end="00:46:06.680" style="s2">step in that direction you know I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.120" end="00:46:08.330" style="s2">to say quickly like I love I love the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.680" end="00:46:10.370" style="s2">comedy stuff too but that&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.330" end="00:46:15.050" style="s2">everybody right the dunking has its</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.370" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">limit um hmm and so sort of by way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.050" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:21.980" style="s2">carlos masa was on the surfs and i i</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.470" style="s2">asked what he thought of the ezra klein</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.980" end="00:46:25.550" style="s2">ben shapiro interview and he said he</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.470" end="00:46:27.590" style="s2">hadn&#39;t seen it but he gave a great</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.550" end="00:46:30.710" style="s2">answer which was you know ben shapiro is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.590" end="00:46:33.050" style="s2">a bad actor and and basically Ezra Klein</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.710" end="00:46:36.410" style="s2">is a naive actor so of course it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.050" end="00:46:39.400" style="s2">fail on those grounds to have any</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.410" end="00:46:42.590" style="s2">traction or to change anybody&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.400" end="00:46:45.110" style="s2">and and and likewise behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.590" end="00:46:46.730" style="s2">with the IDW there&#39;s lots of connections</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.110" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">between people and we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.730" end="00:46:52.490" style="s2">break this down quicker</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:54.260" style="s2">mmm if we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.490" end="00:46:55.730" style="s2">some of the question was you know along</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.260" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">those lines like what can we do to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.730" end="00:47:01.369" style="s2">accelerate the process because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:04.250" style="s2">sort of running out of time with climate</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.369" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">change was the political crisis and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.250" end="00:47:09.830" style="s2">the whole IDW thing you know I say all</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:11.930" style="s2">the time like like look on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.830" end="00:47:14.270" style="s2">maybe it had to happen but it just felt</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.930" end="00:47:17.290" style="s2">like a huge waste of time and a huge</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.270" end="00:47:20.500" style="s2">distraction and and however much</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.290" end="00:47:23.180" style="s2">ostensibly liberal they might identify</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.500" end="00:47:25.849" style="s2">right there they&#39;re kind of pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.180" end="00:47:28.190" style="s2">intellectual discourse helps facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.849" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">more trumpism right even if Ben Shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.190" end="00:47:34.310" style="s2">is anti Trump it facilitates more</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:36.740" style="s2">trumpism so you know that the task is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.310" end="00:47:39.560" style="s2">for for people to dramatically change</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.740" end="00:47:42.080" style="s2">their minds in terms of metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.560" end="00:47:45.320" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s people like Peter</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.080" end="00:47:46.790" style="s2">Dow who&#39;s a great example of that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.320" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">very self-conscious about his</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.790" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">transformation from from from a Hillary</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:56.900" style="s2">Clinton advocate to a big Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:58.940" style="s2">surrogate um and there&#39;s there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.900" end="00:48:02.390" style="s2">other people but it&#39;s rare you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.940" end="00:48:04.550" style="s2">mean and just another little anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.390" end="00:48:06.650" style="s2">about bad actors a friend I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.550" end="00:48:08.060" style="s2">to jump in there&#39;s other people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.650" end="00:48:09.260" style="s2">have questions so maybe yes you got a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:13.190" style="s2">question here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.260" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">wrapping it up yeah Sam Harris is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.190" end="00:48:20.089" style="s2">actor if there&#39;s any salience to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">concept of meta modernism I emailed Sam</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.089" end="00:48:26.030" style="s2">Harris in 2016 from a supportive stance</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:28.520" style="s2">to say hey would this interest you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.030" end="00:48:30.080" style="s2">and he never got back to me Noam Chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.520" end="00:48:32.030" style="s2">got back to me within an hour</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.080" end="00:48:33.890" style="s2">right so it&#39;s and there are people there</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.030" end="00:48:35.300" style="s2">to people who have clashed so my</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.890" end="00:48:38.420" style="s2">question just is what what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.300" end="00:48:40.130" style="s2">better uh to Michael into all of us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.420" end="00:48:43.099" style="s2">Peter you know how can we accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.130" end="00:48:45.140" style="s2">this process I think that the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.099" end="00:48:49.220" style="s2">that I would just move off of briefly</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.140" end="00:48:50.810" style="s2">from that is I read a lot of Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.220" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">when I was younger I was a big ken</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.810" end="00:48:57.980" style="s2">wilber guy and he was helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:49:03.460" style="s2">practice ideas and you know I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.980" end="00:49:03.460" style="s2">my like meditate and then take a run</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.640" end="00:49:10.519" style="s2">ken wilber guy but you know and I did</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.019" end="00:49:12.380" style="s2">but I was studying international</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.519" end="00:49:13.490" style="s2">relations and again it wasn&#39;t that his</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.380" end="00:49:15.019" style="s2">writing on politics</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.490" end="00:49:18.170" style="s2">I certainly disagreed with but it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.019" end="00:49:20.119" style="s2">also just like it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.170" end="00:49:21.950" style="s2">credible like I&#39;m just trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.119" end="00:49:23.869" style="s2">of an analogous field it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.950" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">okay look I know enough that this guy is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.869" end="00:49:29.869" style="s2">not reading the people in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:32.650" style="s2">he&#39;s not reading so I think one thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.869" end="00:49:37.579" style="s2">with with something like meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.650" end="00:49:40.700" style="s2">it&#39;s very helpful to really start now I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.579" end="00:49:43.130" style="s2">look obviously I have my politics so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.700" end="00:49:46.849" style="s2">know who I think the best people are but</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.130" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">in along with with dr. West joke it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.849" end="00:49:51.470" style="s2">like if you want to build a meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:53.240" style="s2">framework you have to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.470" end="00:49:54.500" style="s2">people that you&#39;re plugging into it are</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.240" end="00:49:56.779" style="s2">actually really good at what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.500" end="00:49:57.950" style="s2">doing so I think that if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.779" end="00:50:00.799" style="s2">like okay we&#39;re going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.950" end="00:50:04.250" style="s2">synthesize you know East and West left</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.799" end="00:50:06.619" style="s2">and right and then your examples are</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.250" end="00:50:10.130" style="s2">like oh I you know I&#39;m picking some like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.619" end="00:50:12.680" style="s2">random cult leader from India and some</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.130" end="00:50:16.309" style="s2">like liberal columnist for The New York</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.680" end="00:50:19.640" style="s2">Times and some like you know new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.309" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">guru you&#39;re missing people that might</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.640" end="00:50:24.680" style="s2">represent things from analogous</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:26.089" style="s2">perspectives in all of those spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.680" end="00:50:28.670" style="s2">are a lot more demanding and a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.089" end="00:50:30.349" style="s2">sophisticated and again cuz like I keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.670" end="00:50:32.210" style="s2">thinking of this Adolph read example</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.349" end="00:50:36.230" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many arguments that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.210" end="00:50:37.789" style="s2">see that take place in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.230" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">cultural terrain that I know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.789" end="00:50:42.769" style="s2">like he just covers them better and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.119" end="00:50:45.109" style="s2">not even a question of like yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.769" end="00:50:48.220" style="s2">course you know he would come down on</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.109" end="00:50:51.079" style="s2">one slide or another things but he</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.220" end="00:50:53.210" style="s2">genuinely transcends this debate if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.079" end="00:50:55.279" style="s2">want to take that on then you got to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.210" end="00:50:57.859" style="s2">read stuff that is analogous level to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.279" end="00:51:00.920" style="s2">him to take on so I I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.859" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">accelerating the process is making sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.920" end="00:51:04.700" style="s2">that the sources we have are good and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:06.470" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that I did that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.700" end="00:51:09.769" style="s2">I liked about doing this book too is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.470" end="00:51:11.809" style="s2">just honestly alternative like these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.769" end="00:51:13.519" style="s2">more interesting people to read it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.809" end="00:51:15.529" style="s2">more interesting to read cabral it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.519" end="00:51:18.040" style="s2">more interesting to read Adolf read and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.529" end="00:51:20.630" style="s2">it&#39;s more interesting to read</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.040" end="00:51:25.070" style="s2">you know people that are really engaged</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.630" end="00:51:26.090" style="s2">in this stuff so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.070" end="00:51:27.650" style="s2">where I would start</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.090" end="00:51:33.980" style="s2">but I&#39;ll wrap it up so we can get a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.650" end="00:51:35.510" style="s2">more in great it looks like maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.980" end="00:51:38.870" style="s2">could get in one more question before</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.510" end="00:51:41.750" style="s2">you know guys I actually could I can go</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.870" end="00:51:43.310" style="s2">like another 10 or 15 I did this thing I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.750" end="00:51:46.460" style="s2">have another thing but it&#39;s less tight</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.310" end="00:51:48.950" style="s2">than I thought it was so we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.460" end="00:51:51.260" style="s2">we can go a touch longer okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.950" end="00:51:54.410" style="s2">excellent so yeah we&#39;ll cover one final</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.260" end="00:51:58.670" style="s2">question and we&#39;ll let you answer it to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.410" end="00:51:59.870" style="s2">your leisure let&#39;s see here so Ron we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.670" end="00:52:02.060" style="s2">are getting to your question would you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.870" end="00:52:04.700" style="s2">like thank you and you may have touched</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.060" end="00:52:06.230" style="s2">on this already Michael but I&#39;m pardon</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.700" end="00:52:08.540" style="s2">if there&#39;s a little rambling you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.230" end="00:52:11.120" style="s2">coming in I definitely had resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.540" end="00:52:13.130" style="s2">the idea that Harris and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.120" end="00:52:15.140" style="s2">particularly are on the right so to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.130" end="00:52:17.300" style="s2">speak I know how they look that way</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.140" end="00:52:20.030" style="s2">under maybe our current political</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.300" end="00:52:24.140" style="s2">categories and lenses and and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.030" end="00:52:26.060" style="s2">and I&#39;m very into the meta modern stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.140" end="00:52:27.620" style="s2">I would say just so you know my</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.060" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">perspective and we had a thing on that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.620" end="00:52:31.490" style="s2">just a couple hours ago</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:33.650" style="s2">and I look at someone like Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.490" end="00:52:36.650" style="s2">can&#39;t say about Harris as a meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.650" end="00:52:39.590" style="s2">phenomena in many ways and interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.650" end="00:52:42.530" style="s2">as I&#39;m listening to you today and I find</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.590" end="00:52:43.730" style="s2">I&#39;m having way less resistance to your</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.530" end="00:52:45.620" style="s2">talk that I thought I might have had</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.730" end="00:52:48.920" style="s2">coming in so that&#39;s always a pleasant</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.620" end="00:52:50.570" style="s2">surprise and usually people who identify</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.920" end="00:52:53.540" style="s2">as being in the left eye I sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.570" end="00:52:56.840" style="s2">will find I have a resistance but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.540" end="00:52:58.850" style="s2">finding your your overall approaching</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.840" end="00:53:01.970" style="s2">vibe whether you think this way is meta</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.850" end="00:53:04.790" style="s2">modern to me so I wonder so for my</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.970" end="00:53:06.680" style="s2">strange political ends admittedly I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.790" end="00:53:09.140" style="s2">almost look at someone like Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.680" end="00:53:11.860" style="s2">yourself as both meta modern in many</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.140" end="00:53:14.660" style="s2">ways and different threads of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.860" end="00:53:16.810" style="s2">widely you know viewed and that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.660" end="00:53:19.490" style="s2">need to come together and clash and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.810" end="00:53:21.260" style="s2">tweak and work out stuff so does that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.490" end="00:53:22.820" style="s2">click with you at all that maybe in some</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.260" end="00:53:25.060" style="s2">ways some of these guys that you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.820" end="00:53:27.140" style="s2">the differences with you&#39;re all part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.060" end="00:53:29.570" style="s2">something that a modern national like</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.140" end="00:53:30.890" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging and just needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.570" end="00:53:34.940" style="s2">worked out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.890" end="00:53:40.089" style="s2">stuff needs to be worked out I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.940" end="00:53:43.400" style="s2">guess I look because I I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.089" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">think we&#39;re Jordan Peterson is and a lot</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:14.660" style="s2">Oregon a couple of weeks ago like</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.599" end="00:54:17.150" style="s2">formally you know temporarily has</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.660" end="00:54:19.880" style="s2">suspended democracy and hungry he&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.150" end="00:54:21.170" style="s2">further than and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.880" end="00:54:22.789" style="s2">tendencies this way certainly with</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.170" end="00:54:25.910" style="s2">Boston ro and definitely in some key</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.789" end="00:54:27.829" style="s2">ways with Trump when Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.910" end="00:54:31.010" style="s2">flies there and hangs out with him and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.829" end="00:54:33.819" style="s2">they kind of have a you know complain</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.010" end="00:54:36.890" style="s2">about liberal college professors fest</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.819" end="00:54:39.710" style="s2">the most generous thing I could do is</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.890" end="00:54:41.329" style="s2">that he is not in the world and does not</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.710" end="00:54:46.759" style="s2">understand the dynamics he&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.329" end="00:54:50.690" style="s2">with and III think that that is a really</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.759" end="00:54:54.349" style="s2">big problem so again part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.690" end="00:54:57.980" style="s2">would go to is I I think if we started</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.349" end="00:54:59.750" style="s2">from a very different baseline and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.980" end="00:55:02.000" style="s2">recognize because I certainly like</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.750" end="00:55:03.230" style="s2">Brent&#39;s my perspective is with friend</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.000" end="00:55:04.130" style="s2">like if we&#39;re talking about the United</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.230" end="00:55:07.730" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.130" end="00:55:09.759" style="s2">I guess the policies an agenda that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.730" end="00:55:13.339" style="s2">would be identified as like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.759" end="00:55:15.319" style="s2">quote-unquote left to achieve those</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.339" end="00:55:16.460" style="s2">things like completing the New Deal</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.319" end="00:55:19.009" style="s2">getting everybody health care I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.460" end="00:55:21.710" style="s2">these things aren&#39;t in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.009" end="00:55:24.130" style="s2">global sense would be centrist and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.710" end="00:55:27.849" style="s2">are morally obvious and I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.130" end="00:55:29.960" style="s2">confusing them is really problematic I</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.849" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">think that there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.960" end="00:55:36.920" style="s2">interest me more frankly than Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:38.029" style="s2">but who do speak in similar terrain I</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:39.829" style="s2">mean he&#39;s passed</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.029" end="00:55:41.420" style="s2">if James Hillman was still around I</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.829" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">would be really excited to interview him</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.420" end="00:55:44.630" style="s2">I think his work on article psychology</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.540" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.630" end="00:55:49.160" style="s2">fascinating and it actually can it</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.540" end="00:55:51.740" style="s2">integrated with a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.160" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">critique of psychotherapy sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.740" end="00:55:56.120" style="s2">opposite of Peterson&#39;s which is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.950" end="00:55:58.850" style="s2">psychotherapists are getting tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.120" end="00:56:01.340" style="s2">solving problems that are socially</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.850" end="00:56:03.140" style="s2">generated they mean this in a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.340" end="00:56:05.780" style="s2">sense you know yeah a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.140" end="00:56:07.310" style="s2">really good like yeah course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.780" end="00:56:08.900" style="s2">depression and it was high tea in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.310" end="00:56:12.020" style="s2">culture we&#39;re living in you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.900" end="00:56:14.840" style="s2">you&#39;re there&#39;s a lot to be sort of upset</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.020" end="00:56:17.390" style="s2">about and he managed that with also a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.840" end="00:56:19.180" style="s2">very clear discourse on I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.390" end="00:56:23.330" style="s2">will be called personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.180" end="00:56:25.550" style="s2">ascot at Hren is an ethnographer who has</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.330" end="00:56:27.740" style="s2">actually studied and worked with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.550" end="00:56:31.100" style="s2">United Nations and various other</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.740" end="00:56:32.990" style="s2">agencies terrorism like in a real way</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.100" end="00:56:35.270" style="s2">and has talked from an anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.990" end="00:56:38.630" style="s2">perspective about the loss of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.270" end="00:56:40.250" style="s2">and sacred value drives and how they</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.630" end="00:56:46.790" style="s2">relate to why people join groups like</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.250" end="00:56:49.190" style="s2">this so Peterson not so much and maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.790" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">also I guess I also I think met Amman is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.190" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">important but I also looked at things</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:55.130" style="s2">kind of dialectically so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:56.810" style="s2">there was this vacuum in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.130" end="00:56:58.730" style="s2">that he came in and filled and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.810" end="00:57:03.260" style="s2">necessarily someone had to fill that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.730" end="00:57:05.630" style="s2">wish it was filled better right i but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.260" end="00:57:07.310" style="s2">think that maybe the vibe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.630" end="00:57:09.470" style="s2">getting from me and where I&#39;m much more</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.310" end="00:57:15.320" style="s2">receptive and I hope it comes across is</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.470" end="00:57:18.380" style="s2">that the train he is on in some key</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.320" end="00:57:21.340" style="s2">areas is a totally valid terrain even as</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.380" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">I would have you know a pretty tough</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.340" end="00:57:29.710" style="s2">critique of him but I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.920" end="00:57:33.820" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in meaning purpose</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.710" end="00:57:35.870" style="s2">these types of things I don&#39;t of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.820" end="00:57:37.790" style="s2">we all should be interested in these</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.870" end="00:57:39.800" style="s2">types of things I I hope that answers</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.790" end="00:57:41.870" style="s2">your question somewhat and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.800" end="00:57:42.410" style="s2">totally think that in the you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.870" end="00:57:43.970" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.410" end="00:57:50.270" style="s2">it goes back to what I was saying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.970" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">Brent to of course there can be really</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.270" end="00:57:55.640" style="s2">big there I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:57:57.410" style="s2">everybody has the same perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.640" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">the same politics but I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.410" end="00:58:01.130" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.130" end="00:58:03.950" style="s2">lines of sophistication that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.130" end="00:58:05.750" style="s2">clear first just as like conversely I</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.950" end="00:58:07.250" style="s2">you know I didn&#39;t write a chapter saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.750" end="00:58:09.799" style="s2">that Jordan Peterson doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.250" end="00:58:13.060" style="s2">anything about Jung know I&#39;ll cede that</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.799" end="00:58:17.170" style="s2">to him but he should see politics to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.060" end="00:58:17.170" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:24.349" style="s2">excellent and with that as our learning</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.970" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">final statements you&#39;d like to say</p>
