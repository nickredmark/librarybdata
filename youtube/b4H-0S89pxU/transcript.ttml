<p begin="00:00:11.849" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">a day because of his skin color and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.530" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">immediately the mob set out to destroy</p>

<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">to speak or not on the basis of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:25.980" style="s2">skin color which seems like a</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">and they believe that my words in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">email are transparently racist and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:47.910" style="s2">think we&#39;re caught quite off guard when</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">people who were not at Evergreen read my</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.910" end="00:00:54.539" style="s2">letter and couldn&#39;t find any racism in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">it it all looks like a preview now for</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">weeks the mob</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">harassed and threatened the professor</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">faculty denounced in campus police said</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:05.580" style="s2">and instead urged him to stay off campus</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:07.830" style="s2">entirely eventually he resigned</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">to Professor thanks so much for coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">on I&#39;ve thought of you since all of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">started and I should say at the outset I</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:23.909" style="s2">you weren&#39;t a conservative last I talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">to you I doubt you were now but you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.909" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">one of the people who saw this most</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">clearly earliest so what&#39;s your reaction</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">to watching it happen to millions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">others well I wish we had gotten to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">earlier Tucker you&#39;re right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">same phenomenon that we&#39;ve seen on</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">college campuses maybe most dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">at Evergreen I warned Congress when they</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">had me testified that this was going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">spill out into every other facet of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">civilization and that appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but I do think we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">maybe missing the deeper part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">story people are obviously frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">and angry and they&#39;ve spilled out in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">street but the reason that they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">done that has to do with a political</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">corruption in both of our major parties</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">which has to a large extent frozen the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.619" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">working population out of the prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">that they have generated so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">surprising to see them protest</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">but what is surprising is that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">protest has been hijacked by a fringe</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">ideology from the corner of the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:26.790" style="s2">the fringe ideology in which almost no</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:29.370" style="s2">reasonable person could possibly believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.790" end="00:02:32.310" style="s2">and yet its wielding tremendous power as</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.370" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">we are seeing in every facet of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">lives you make such a deep point that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">want to play a night after night which</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.860" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">is the problems that people are angry</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">about are mostly economic problems and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:46.430" style="s2">problems of political corruption but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">they&#39;ve been reframed as racial problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.430" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">has that reframing been intentional they</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:56.459" style="s2">do you think I think two things have</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:59.160" style="s2">happened one a this fringe ideology has</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.459" end="00:03:02.069" style="s2">discovered that it can hijack that anger</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">and then we are seeing on the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.069" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">side we are seeing powerful political</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">forces embrace this ideology for cynical</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:11.730" style="s2">reasons which is amplifying it and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">cynical reasons basically have to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.730" end="00:03:15.989" style="s2">with the fact that if Americans were</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">angry at the right thing they would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.989" end="00:03:20.100" style="s2">going after political corruption and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">we&#39;re angry at each other because we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">imagine that we are guilty of prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">then we won&#39;t do that so the key</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:29.850" style="s2">question is how can we get leadership at</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">the top that addresses the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.850" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">corruption at its root and if I might I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.670" end="00:03:36.950" style="s2">have unveiled a plan to do that and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">like to run you through it briefly</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">please do so the plan is called Unity</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:48.660" style="s2">2020 and it involves we the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">drafting two people one from center left</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.660" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">and one from center right who have three</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">characteristics they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:56.160" style="s2">courageous they need to be capable and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">they need to be Patriots they would join</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.160" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2">together and they would agree to govern</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">as a team they would discuss every</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:04.950" style="s2">decision and only when they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:06.989" style="s2">reach agreement or when a decision had</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.950" end="00:04:09.810" style="s2">to be made quickly would the president</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">rule after four years the team would</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.810" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">reverse and the president would run as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.190" style="s2">vice president and this would continue</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:16.190" style="s2">until one of them was ineligible</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.700" end="00:04:20.690" style="s2">boy changing the system of government it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.770" end="00:04:21.920" style="s2">seems to me like we&#39;re gonna change the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.690" end="00:04:24.860" style="s2">system of government no matter what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.920" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">do and that might be a better way to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.860" end="00:04:28.430" style="s2">it all you think about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">appreciate your bravery and your clarity</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.430" end="00:04:32.090" style="s2">and I hope you&#39;ll come back because I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:35.960" style="s2">in the face of a moment like this I wish</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.520" end="00:04:40.510" style="s2">we had more time fresher thank you so</p>
