<p begin="00:00:06.220" end="00:00:10.120" style="s2">we&#39;re about to begin if you can hear me</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.430" end="00:00:16.090" style="s2">give me</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.120" end="00:00:18.580" style="s2">thumbs up alright welcome to another</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.090" end="00:00:21.430" style="s2">meeting of the intellectual Explorers</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.580" end="00:00:24.189" style="s2">Club I am Peter the organizer of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.430" end="00:00:26.950" style="s2">group and to give some context to those</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.189" end="00:00:28.390" style="s2">who might not be familiar I started this</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.950" end="00:00:31.390" style="s2">club in Toronto about two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.390" end="00:00:33.640" style="s2">solely as an in-person meet up then I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.390" end="00:00:37.600" style="s2">created a podcast with the same name and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.640" end="00:00:40.899" style="s2">more recently I was inspired to take the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.600" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">in-person meetings online and I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.899" end="00:00:46.660" style="s2">currently dubbing these experiments</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:48.910" style="s2">since making wormholes and I&#39;m inviting</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.660" end="00:00:51.160" style="s2">past podcast guests on to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.910" end="00:00:53.469" style="s2">them so for example last week we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.160" end="00:00:57.460" style="s2">Nancy Strickler from Kickstarter Fame</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.469" end="00:00:59.379" style="s2">today we have Jordan Hall and in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.460" end="00:01:02.999" style="s2">pipeline we have the likes of John Verve</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.379" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">a key Andrew Taggart and guys and sock</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.999" end="00:01:09.820" style="s2">confirmed so I&#39;m pretty much allowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:12.820" style="s2">the facilitator to do whatever he or she</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:15.430" style="s2">wants last week for example the antsy</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.820" end="00:01:18.490" style="s2">did more of a workshop with like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.430" end="00:01:20.410" style="s2">PowerPoint and group exercises but today</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.490" end="00:01:21.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to lean more on sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.410" end="00:01:25.990" style="s2">that collective intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.880" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">group so in a moment I&#39;ll hand it over</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.990" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">to to Jordan he&#39;ll speak more on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:36.280" style="s2">but first I&#39;ll speak a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:39.400" style="s2">it myself let&#39;s see so I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.280" end="00:01:41.730" style="s2">has needless to say he has a great mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.400" end="00:01:43.720" style="s2">and is incredibly intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.730" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">because of this I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.720" end="00:01:51.340" style="s2">understandable to look up to him as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:53.890" style="s2">epistemic authority on game B and as he</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.340" end="00:01:55.450" style="s2">mentioned to me previously he mostly</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.890" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">shows up at least on the Internet in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.450" end="00:02:04.900" style="s2">sort of a broadcasting mode so I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:06.820" style="s2">you know if we hold on too tightly to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.900" end="00:02:09.550" style="s2">this frame of Jordan being the epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.820" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">Authority of game B it might turn this</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.550" end="00:02:14.650" style="s2">session to some kind of Q&amp;A dynamics but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:16.989" style="s2">I want to make it clear that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:21.159" style="s2">particular sense-making session is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.989" end="00:02:23.230" style="s2">about that so that being said I&#39;ll hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.159" end="00:02:24.129" style="s2">it over to the man who needs no</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.230" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.129" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.050" end="00:02:34.600" style="s2">I finally gotten to the point that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:35.770" style="s2">always been going after which is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.600" end="00:02:41.590" style="s2">have to worry about people asking me how</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.770" end="00:02:44.050" style="s2">to introduce myself it&#39;s nice so I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.590" end="00:02:46.180" style="s2">the may be a way to start this is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.050" end="00:02:49.570" style="s2">just have a very simple round everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.180" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">just introduces themselves and we&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.570" end="00:02:54.010" style="s2">think although I would definitely urge a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:55.090" style="s2">high degree of agency in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.010" end="00:02:57.730" style="s2">choosing what seems to be the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.090" end="00:03:01.600" style="s2">answer but I think that a good approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.730" end="00:03:04.210" style="s2">would be to actually focus on how it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.600" end="00:03:06.070" style="s2">that you chose to be in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.210" end="00:03:08.440" style="s2">context to be on this call today what</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.070" end="00:03:11.830" style="s2">aspect of you is what&#39;s actually showing</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.440" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">up here and then if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.830" end="00:03:17.620" style="s2">particular question or curiosity or</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:20.740" style="s2">inquiry in or about the domain of game B</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.620" end="00:03:23.410" style="s2">that is alive then bring that into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.740" end="00:03:25.000" style="s2">center as well and then hopefully we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.410" end="00:03:28.240" style="s2">actually do is we can try to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.000" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">to have a coherent conversation which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.240" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">to say that it will each be listening</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:35.860" style="s2">very closely Twitter in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:39.459" style="s2">wants to be said in the group which</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.860" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">requires a real effective application of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.459" end="00:03:46.390" style="s2">rule Omega which means notice when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:48.160" style="s2">were I suppose saying the language of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.390" end="00:03:49.660" style="s2">ego might be strongly or when your ego</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.160" end="00:03:53.500" style="s2">is speaking or when there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.660" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">sense of performative or controlling</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:57.550" style="s2">speaking coming out of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">notice if you can listen to what other</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.550" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">people are saying in such a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">can hear the thing that is trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:06.220" style="s2">spoken not instead of what&#39;s being said</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">but the deeper basis of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.220" end="00:04:09.670" style="s2">endeavoring to be expressed and then if</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:13.380" style="s2">it is yours and it may very well not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.670" end="00:04:16.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people on this call to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.380" end="00:04:19.480" style="s2">further that then try to find the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.450" end="00:04:20.080" style="s2">way in yourself to further that so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.480" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.080" end="00:04:24.640" style="s2">ideally we will find ourselves noticing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">that there is a single tone a single a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.640" end="00:04:29.890" style="s2">single thing that is being expressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:32.910" style="s2">here and if not perhaps we&#39;ll learn a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.890" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">little bit so I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.910" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">does everybody have the same geometry I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:38.970" style="s2">have or is it just if I just should I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">call everybody&#39;s name a one way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.970" end="00:04:43.259" style="s2">Jordan is to just choose someone when</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:46.919" style="s2">the person goes and that person chooses</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.259" end="00:04:48.569" style="s2">someone else to go like play tag and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.919" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">if everyone just zooms out so they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.569" end="00:04:51.889" style="s2">see like everyone on their screen that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">would be great</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.889" end="00:04:57.690" style="s2">so I will choose one six four seven</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">eight six nine nine one eight two which</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.690" end="00:05:07.289" style="s2">is a assume character from Blade Runner</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:10.139" style="s2">just on my bottom right corner hi this</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.289" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">is Daniel I apologize if there&#39;s ambient</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.139" end="00:05:17.599" style="s2">noise but I just called in because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:19.949" style="s2">five minutes away from a computer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.599" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">I&#39;m lacking a little bit of contact and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.949" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">first person to go but I can try if</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">you&#39;d like we can take you off the hook</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">and punt it to my second-favorite all</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:38.220" style="s2">right that&#39;s probably the bad call nice</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">alright so we were already beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.220" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">so we&#39;ll now go with the entity named</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:47.849" style="s2">Jordan who is not me sorry I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">been able to figure out how to change my</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.849" end="00:05:53.099" style="s2">name mid call to make that easier so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">you&#39;re saying what is the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.099" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">bringing me to this call right now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:06:01.139" style="s2">most so my interest in game B right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:03.509" style="s2">is I feel like in the way that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.139" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">described it I&#39;m sitting in a stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.509" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">where I&#39;m really trying to develop my</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:10.169" style="s2">individual sovereignty right now more</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.740" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">than anything else and I am interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.169" end="00:06:15.719" style="s2">in I don&#39;t know I mean I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">interested in that and I have like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.719" end="00:06:19.259" style="s2">number of pieces of curiosity around</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">what to do when you&#39;re sort of sitting</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.259" end="00:06:22.949" style="s2">at that stage where you don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:27.780" style="s2">you&#39;re really ready to become a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.949" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">driver and the more broad sense I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.780" end="00:06:31.770" style="s2">that&#39;s it was there something else you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:33.300" style="s2">wanted me to add or if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.770" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">particular question about the nature or</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.300" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">essence of game B that felt meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">alive and then and then take the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:41.250" style="s2">person in the chain okay on the way near</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:42.570" style="s2">the tail end you have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.250" end="00:06:43.699" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s already gone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.570" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">actually me buddy</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.699" end="00:06:48.659" style="s2">okay so I am</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:50.849" style="s2">I guess my curiosity is around that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.659" end="00:06:53.399" style="s2">it&#39;s likes okay so if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.849" end="00:06:54.899" style="s2">you&#39;re not in that part of strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.399" end="00:06:57.029" style="s2">individual sovereignity to start</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.460" end="00:07:59.470" style="s2">something that completely dovetailed</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.610" end="00:08:04.510" style="s2">with how I&#39;ve been thinking about myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.470" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">in connectionless societies I moved a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.510" end="00:08:10.630" style="s2">theory and philosophy person which kind</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">the recent years I&#39;ve felt I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:22.570" style="s2">called to this wider kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:24.100" style="s2">thinking this just wasn&#39;t thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.570" end="00:08:26.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t anything I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.100" end="00:08:29.890" style="s2">before now I&#39;m really fascinated by it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.610" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">so yeah everything I just devoured when</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.890" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">I started listening to Jordan halls work</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2">everything resonated so clearly with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:44.860" style="s2">that I just wanted to go deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:47.860" style="s2">deeper so I&#39;ve just fallen deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.860" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">this rabbit hole and because I am an art</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.860" end="00:08:54.010" style="s2">person in this TEDx person I guess I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.390" end="00:10:31.500" style="s2">think I&#39;m not onto a book I read the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">really early on called non zero but not</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:39.450" style="s2">to yourself my question that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">thinking about a couple days now is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.450" end="00:10:47.520" style="s2">do you create a little religion without</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:49.260" style="s2">religion specifically how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.520" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">something with unity but without the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.260" end="00:11:03.110" style="s2">coercion or being told how to think or</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:11:03.110" style="s2">what to do and I am going to pick Isaiah</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.280" end="00:11:11.460" style="s2">hello its Isaiah&#39;s actually with us but</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">it&#39;s okay so yeah I kind of got into</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.460" end="00:11:17.190" style="s2">this space by following the Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">hashtag down to the very end and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.190" end="00:11:23.580" style="s2">really resonated with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">previous stuff I&#39;d studied and it really</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.580" end="00:11:28.140" style="s2">resonates with my current interest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:29.630" style="s2">testimony who lives in Canada I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.140" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">starting I&#39;m learning a lot more about</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:35.460" style="s2">the cultures and philosophy of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.220" end="00:11:37.830" style="s2">indigenous people we&#39;re here and it it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.460" end="00:11:40.950" style="s2">seems to me almost like they were they</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.830" end="00:11:43.190" style="s2">had developed like a proto game B and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.950" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.190" end="00:11:52.110" style="s2">something we can we can learn from that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:56.630" style="s2">to help develop the actual game B yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.110" end="00:11:56.630" style="s2">so that&#39;s I will pass it to Jake</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.149" end="00:12:07.829" style="s2">Thank You Isaac so I&#39;m I&#39;m Jake I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.339" end="00:12:09.809" style="s2">I&#39;m a filmmaker I also do media for an</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.829" end="00:12:13.709" style="s2">academic Institute focused on psychology</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.809" end="00:12:16.110" style="s2">and technology stuff and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.709" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">what brings me to this conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.110" end="00:12:23.160" style="s2">had for a long time a kind of diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:25.970" style="s2">set of interests in politics and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:28.649" style="s2">narrative and epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:32.300" style="s2">meditation an existential risk and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.649" end="00:12:34.649" style="s2">these things were to sort of disparate</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.300" end="00:12:36.449" style="s2">communities that I was involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.649" end="00:12:38.579" style="s2">really didn&#39;t have any dialogue with one</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.449" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">another and I certainly didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.579" end="00:12:45.389" style="s2">to unify them in my own mind but I had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.470" end="00:12:49.019" style="s2">strong intuition that there was some</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.389" end="00:12:51.089" style="s2">kind of relevance of each of these areas</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.019" end="00:12:53.699" style="s2">inquiry to the others</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.089" end="00:12:55.019" style="s2">and when I started stumbling upon this</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.699" end="00:13:00.180" style="s2">kind of a larger conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.019" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">since making it did at least give me a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.180" end="00:13:04.529" style="s2">framework not just for unifying my own</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:07.769" style="s2">interest but for sort of seeing why each</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.529" end="00:13:11.730" style="s2">of those had seemed so kind of vital and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.769" end="00:13:13.709" style="s2">important to me so yeah that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.730" end="00:13:16.350" style="s2">of how I got involved in this I got</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.709" end="00:13:18.179" style="s2">interested in this and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.350" end="00:13:21.990" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of most alive for me with</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.179" end="00:13:23.339" style="s2">respect to game B is you know unlike a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.990" end="00:13:25.019" style="s2">lot of other kind of political</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.339" end="00:13:26.970" style="s2">conversations it place it seems to place</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.019" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">equal emphasis on kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.970" end="00:13:32.370" style="s2">individual sovereignty component and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:34.620" style="s2">self development and that and also this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.370" end="00:13:37.410" style="s2">kind of larger systemic or incentive</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.620" end="00:13:38.730" style="s2">design approach and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.410" end="00:13:40.949" style="s2">I&#39;m most interested and learning about</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.730" end="00:13:43.139" style="s2">is kind of how those two relate to one</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.949" end="00:13:45.209" style="s2">another what&#39;s the proper domain for</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.139" end="00:13:50.089" style="s2">each so that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.209" end="00:13:50.089" style="s2">and I will pass to Zachary</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.529" end="00:13:57.659" style="s2">hey there quite a lot of people from</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.899" end="00:14:01.919" style="s2">Toronto or Ontario so it seems it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.659" end="00:14:08.159" style="s2">um I suppose I&#39;m always up for a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.919" end="00:14:10.699" style="s2">conversation and I came to game B kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.159" end="00:14:12.749" style="s2">of chasing that perpetual pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.699" end="00:14:16.249" style="s2">self-development which includes</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.749" end="00:14:19.579" style="s2">understanding what we would call game a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.249" end="00:14:21.479" style="s2">which is how I kind of came on to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.579" end="00:14:26.309" style="s2">everything that led me to game B a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.479" end="00:14:28.349" style="s2">couple years ago um I&#39;ve wanted to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.309" end="00:14:31.769" style="s2">into the intellectual Explorers Club but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.349" end="00:14:35.659" style="s2">up until think last week I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.769" end="00:14:38.819" style="s2">able to get down there in person and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.659" end="00:14:43.729" style="s2">what interests me about game B is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.819" end="00:14:43.729" style="s2">through the rapid acceleration in</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.789" end="00:14:51.779" style="s2">exchanges I guess mediated through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.449" end="00:14:54.539" style="s2">internet and all this new technology is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.779" end="00:14:57.419" style="s2">that it seems like we have we&#39;re poised</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.539" end="00:15:02.039" style="s2">for a big breakthrough in in something</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.419" end="00:15:04.470" style="s2">new so I&#39;m curious to see how how things</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.039" end="00:15:07.220" style="s2">are developing and what better way than</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.470" end="00:15:10.019" style="s2">to get out and speak with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.220" end="00:15:12.509" style="s2">interested to see how things will will</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.019" end="00:15:15.139" style="s2">turn out and I suppose I&#39;ll pass it over</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.509" end="00:15:15.139" style="s2">to Antoine</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.850" end="00:15:32.319" style="s2">um what brought me looks so a few years</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.850" end="00:15:36.130" style="s2">ago I became interested in what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.319" end="00:15:41.079" style="s2">has termed sovereignty just increasing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.130" end="00:15:47.529" style="s2">uh it&#39;s your own agency and that led me</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.079" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">to find a neuro hacker and or find neuro</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.529" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">hackers website and then Jordans some</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:58.779" style="s2">Jordans work and and what brought me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:02.110" style="s2">this individual discussion is I&#39;ve found</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.840" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">and how to how to be critical of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.530" end="00:19:49.220" style="s2">without falling prey to the the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">of critique to push things away without</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.480" end="00:21:12.630" style="s2">and the question that feels alive in me</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.320" end="00:21:15.050" style="s2">right now is how can I learn to more</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.630" end="00:21:27.140" style="s2">deeply listen and how can I use this</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.450" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">would say it&#39;s day one inspired and for</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.420" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">those of you are not familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:38.150" style="s2">term it&#39;s more of a certain quality of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:42.560" style="s2">intuition that says go here and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.150" end="00:27:44.030" style="s2">question I have is this is just came to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.560" end="00:27:47.150" style="s2">me when I was speaking with Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.030" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">Phil before this call is what&#39;s the role</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.150" end="00:27:56.950" style="s2">of sacrifice and playing game be and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:28:03.970" style="s2">I&#39;ll choose my stoic partner in crime</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.950" end="00:28:06.070" style="s2">Daniel hey my name is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.970" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">I think there are many things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.070" end="00:28:10.660" style="s2">brought me here today but the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:13.230" style="s2">proximal cause is that I&#39;ve noticed as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.660" end="00:28:16.059" style="s2">learn more about existential risk I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.230" end="00:28:17.559" style="s2">start to feel this low level hum of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.059" end="00:28:21.400" style="s2">anxiety just operating in the background</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.559" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">at all times and as I become more aware</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.400" end="00:28:27.010" style="s2">of that sensation I realized that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:30.340" style="s2">not particularly useful on its own but</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.010" end="00:28:31.900" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem it doesn&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.340" end="00:28:35.289" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate to completely dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.900" end="00:28:38.610" style="s2">it either so I wanted to find some way</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.289" end="00:28:41.470" style="s2">to act on that feeling that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.610" end="00:28:42.610" style="s2">potentially productive and and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.470" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">seemed to be a step in the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.610" end="00:28:46.690" style="s2">direction because I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:48.780" style="s2">what to do with that feeling but doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.690" end="00:28:53.260" style="s2">nothing doesn&#39;t seem like a good option</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.780" end="00:28:56.230" style="s2">my question I actually Tim kind of stole</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.260" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">my question more broadly I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.230" end="00:29:01.080" style="s2">a little bit more about how I can start</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:04.570" style="s2">practicing game B in a very practical</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.080" end="00:29:06.669" style="s2">mundane like day-to-day sense such that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:10.360" style="s2">it&#39;s actually rippling out positively</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.669" end="00:29:13.659" style="s2">across time for issues of existential</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.360" end="00:29:16.539" style="s2">risk but one of the main qualifiers is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.659" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">to what extent do does one need to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.539" end="00:29:22.900" style="s2">successful at game a in order to play</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:24.520" style="s2">game beasts successfully and I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.900" end="00:29:30.570" style="s2">will choose Melissa I was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.520" end="00:29:33.610" style="s2">last one hi everyone can you hear me</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.570" end="00:29:36.280" style="s2">yeah okay I apologize for being late</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.610" end="00:29:38.890" style="s2">I was didn&#39;t know where to find the zoom</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.280" end="00:29:41.230" style="s2">link so I&#39;m disappointed that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.890" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">get to hear all of your answers to these</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.230" end="00:29:47.650" style="s2">questions but what partically brings</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:50.260" style="s2">what part of me brings me to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.650" end="00:29:52.059" style="s2">conversation is all of me because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.260" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">been dying to have this conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.059" end="00:29:59.559" style="s2">keep sending videos and podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">everybody and all my all my people and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.559" end="00:30:06.610" style="s2">can&#39;t seem to get anyone to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:08.260" style="s2">me in this way so this is a real gift</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.610" end="00:30:13.380" style="s2">and I appreciate all of you for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.260" end="00:30:13.380" style="s2">and the questions I have are</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.750" end="00:30:22.570" style="s2">what do we do what do we all do together</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.070" end="00:30:22.570" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.380" end="00:30:29.570" style="s2">where did we&#39;re to begin I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.700" end="00:30:29.570" style="s2">already begun but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:41.070" style="s2">but next steps how to connect for actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.890" end="00:30:44.760" style="s2">projects deepen the practices of being</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.070" end="00:30:46.710" style="s2">sovereign and I&#39;d want to get myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.760" end="00:30:50.190" style="s2">around more people and having these</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.710" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2">conversations in order to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.190" end="00:30:59.930" style="s2">taking taking some action so I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:30:59.930" style="s2">about my next steps is how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.060" end="00:31:10.410" style="s2">Peter do you have anything left or is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.830" end="00:31:13.590" style="s2">uh all my court</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:20.100" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s all you great</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.590" end="00:31:22.710" style="s2">so I&#39;m Jordan and I I&#39;m here because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.100" end="00:31:24.630" style="s2">the thing that has begun the process of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.710" end="00:31:26.760" style="s2">happening at least to some extent with</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.630" end="00:31:31.160" style="s2">my participation over the past seven</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.760" end="00:31:33.330" style="s2">years seems to be having more energy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.160" end="00:31:35.700" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.330" end="00:31:38.100" style="s2">Peters language that my that it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.700" end="00:31:41.970" style="s2">be deeply resonate with my de menthe</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.100" end="00:31:44.309" style="s2">so the inquiry that brings you all here</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:47.159" style="s2">is an inquiry that brings me here as</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.309" end="00:31:48.690" style="s2">well so a few things that were coming up</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.159" end="00:31:51.330" style="s2">for me that I noticed as I was listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.690" end="00:31:53.429" style="s2">was some part of me definitely wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.330" end="00:31:56.490" style="s2">just begin the process of answering each</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.429" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">of these questions and of course I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.490" end="00:31:59.970" style="s2">noticed a couple of things one was</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:02.490" style="s2">that&#39;s really not going to be reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.970" end="00:32:04.890" style="s2">in the context of a group of this size</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.490" end="00:32:05.940" style="s2">the number of questions that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.890" end="00:32:07.289" style="s2">next thing was that it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.940" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">even reasonable in general he&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.289" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">not the right approach to take to try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:13.409" style="s2">address the things were the questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.590" end="00:32:16.110" style="s2">they&#39;re actually being asked so then I</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.409" end="00:32:17.880" style="s2">had a an interesting memory of being in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">a conversation somewhat like this and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.880" end="00:32:22.620" style="s2">noticed that I was asked to take a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">perspective to kind of observe what was</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.620" end="00:32:27.900" style="s2">happening and notice was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.820" style="s2">mine inside myself and heard a sense all</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.900" end="00:32:31.230" style="s2">the different things that were coming up</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.820" end="00:32:33.539" style="s2">in me and all the different ways they</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.230" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2">were coming up notice what observations</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.539" end="00:32:37.500" style="s2">happen to be impressing themselves upon</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">the in terms of the group who was</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.500" end="00:32:41.580" style="s2">happening there and then more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:44.039" style="s2">try to sense or notice if there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.580" end="00:32:46.830" style="s2">something that somehow seemed to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.039" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">like be waving at me from the far</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.830" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">distances from the periphery or from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">horizons and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.950" end="00:32:55.380" style="s2">that context one of the things that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.299" end="00:32:57.990" style="s2">quite interesting to me is that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.380" end="00:33:01.590" style="s2">noticed that even as the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.990" end="00:33:04.380" style="s2">seemed to have a life of its own looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.590" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">back each person&#39;s questioned actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.380" end="00:33:08.429" style="s2">seemed to have a piece of it brought</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:09.990" style="s2">forward wishes to said that if each</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.429" end="00:33:11.399" style="s2">person reflected on their own inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.990" end="00:33:12.659" style="s2">they would actually notice that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.399" end="00:33:14.639" style="s2">something in the conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.659" end="00:33:17.299" style="s2">actually meaningfully extending their</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.639" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">own inquiry even if it wasn&#39;t explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.299" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">done so and also that people&#39;s depth of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">inquiry their questions got richer and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:30.179" style="s2">deeper so perhaps that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:31.889" style="s2">is alive for me today is how might that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.179" end="00:33:35.399" style="s2">work and so I would just repeat the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.889" end="00:33:38.760" style="s2">question that was at the title what does</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.399" end="00:33:41.190" style="s2">it mean for us to play a game B what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.760" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">this notion of meaningfulness and how</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.190" end="00:33:47.490" style="s2">does that notion of meaningfulness guide</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:51.179" style="s2">us moment to moment in the context like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.490" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">this one so as things come up if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.179" end="00:33:55.100" style="s2">feel like something is really calling</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:58.289" style="s2">for you to bring it in please do so</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.100" end="00:34:00.809" style="s2">notice what&#39;s happening in your cell</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.289" end="00:34:03.080" style="s2">phone and others and let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.809" end="00:34:03.080" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:11.500" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.700" end="00:35:15.849" style="s2">forgive me are we are we is this the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.769" end="00:35:15.849" style="s2">point where we&#39;re allowed to chime in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:21.840" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t hear you is it muted</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:24.360" style="s2">yeah please do yes you&#39;re quite excited</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.840" end="00:35:26.010" style="s2">so the the the thing that came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.360" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">when you were when you&#39;re speaking was</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.010" end="00:35:32.580" style="s2">that when I was giving my initial answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:34.500" style="s2">I was describing a kind of collection of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.580" end="00:35:37.940" style="s2">interest that I had that seemed to find</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:40.860" style="s2">expression in some kind of larger</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.270" style="s2">communal project the interest that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.860" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">seemed disparate and it kind of unique</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.270" end="00:35:46.619" style="s2">to me and expression in a larger project</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.080" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering if that general</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.619" end="00:35:51.630" style="s2">phenomenon of an individual&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.080" end="00:35:55.110" style="s2">strange concatenation of interests</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.630" end="00:35:57.150" style="s2">finding expression in collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.110" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">projects might be part of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.150" end="00:36:01.350" style="s2">to to play game B or what might be</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.930" end="00:36:29.720" style="s2">I will speak to that and just say that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.289" end="00:36:33.260" style="s2">hope so because it really doesn&#39;t make</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.460" end="00:36:51.170" style="s2">me here is very it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.980" end="00:36:54.559" style="s2">with my life and be more communicative</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.170" end="00:36:57.049" style="s2">in my in the general sense of what that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.559" end="00:37:01.250" style="s2">means professionally but personally it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.049" end="00:37:05.480" style="s2">makes sense to me because I engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.250" end="00:37:08.660" style="s2">so much self work and because that kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.480" end="00:37:11.710" style="s2">of for me generates once you kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.660" end="00:37:17.390" style="s2">that for a while and kind of becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.710" end="00:37:22.760" style="s2">obvious that what you&#39;re doing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.390" end="00:37:27.500" style="s2">needs to kind of you need I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.760" end="00:37:32.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to sound sort of it needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.500" end="00:37:35.000" style="s2">to be beyond just yourself I guess and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.020" end="00:37:37.250" style="s2">that didn&#39;t seem initially like that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.000" end="00:37:41.779" style="s2">ever going to be something that would</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.250" end="00:37:44.210" style="s2">make me interested in the theories and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.779" end="00:37:49.069" style="s2">ideas of people from a completely</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.210" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">different sector in the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.069" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">sort of thing but I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.780" end="00:38:00.420" style="s2">to believe that something I would think</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.190" style="s2">that that would be kind of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.420" end="00:38:05.010" style="s2">saying Drake rings true to me in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.190" end="00:38:07.230" style="s2">sense that like reducing like quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:10.080" style="s2">different people on the surface but</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.230" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something that kind of tethers</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.080" end="00:38:18.540" style="s2">us all together and that would seem like</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">what I would think of is a game here she</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.540" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">type quality</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.050" end="00:38:34.920" style="s2">that for me hearing people speak and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.570" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">it&#39;s resonating with my question about</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.920" end="00:38:38.810" style="s2">how to do this together is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.630" end="00:38:42.330" style="s2">a social aspect so by calling a game B</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.810" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">we&#39;re already identifying social Assoc</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.330" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">ality to it there are three ways of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:53.610" style="s2">dealing with existential risk or despair</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">so one thing here is we&#39;re noting it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.610" end="00:38:58.410" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:39:02.670" style="s2">we&#39;re also noting it&#39;s a game and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.410" end="00:39:05.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not the first in a series of games</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.670" end="00:39:08.300" style="s2">but there is at least one prior to it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.490" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">bring those things together I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.300" end="00:39:13.260" style="s2">that might also speak to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:16.110" style="s2">this what does it take or does one need</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.260" end="00:39:19.170" style="s2">to succeed and game a in order to play</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.110" end="00:39:24.230" style="s2">game B so part of it might be the game</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.170" end="00:39:24.230" style="s2">of transmuting game and to gain these</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.750" end="00:39:36.730" style="s2">sure that you can&#39;t like I think to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.210" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">extent that you can succeed a gaming you</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.730" end="00:39:46.359" style="s2">it seems like you can&#39;t play Gabby then</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:51.430" style="s2">game is built on a sort of disinterest</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.359" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">in yes what seems to me by definition</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.430" end="00:39:57.930" style="s2">the qualities the game be is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:57.930" style="s2">trying to foster</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.520" end="00:40:06.580" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.800" end="00:40:11.810" style="s2">I noticed the question popping up in me</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.869" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">which would be something like what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.810" end="00:40:16.700" style="s2">it mean to succeed in game a and also</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.080" style="s2">noticing that perhaps his objective</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.700" end="00:40:19.460" style="s2">position between the question what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.080" end="00:40:22.330" style="s2">it mean to succeed in gaming what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.460" end="00:40:22.330" style="s2">it mean to play game day</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.859" end="00:40:31.650" style="s2">um I love that question Jordan because</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.769" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">it&#39;s turned something at me because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.650" end="00:40:37.049" style="s2">not successful at game a game a success</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:39.509" style="s2">equals money and power and whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.049" end="00:40:42.959" style="s2">that&#39;s true or that&#39;s just my story I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.509" end="00:40:45.509" style="s2">will do further inquiry on later but</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.959" end="00:40:49.170" style="s2">that what Antoine was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.509" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">success in game B is almost antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.170" end="00:40:54.269" style="s2">to maybe I&#39;m pretty weren&#39;t resolved to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:57.660" style="s2">success in game a I know what puts me in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.269" end="00:41:00.299" style="s2">a place to know how to play game B is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.660" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">exactly what game a does not reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.299" end="00:41:04.410" style="s2">it&#39;s my disability it&#39;s my poverty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.469" style="s2">the stuff that puts the at a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.410" end="00:41:10.229" style="s2">disadvantage in game a it gave me all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.469" end="00:41:12.410" style="s2">the capacity and the space to create</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.229" end="00:41:14.819" style="s2">what I believe is a solution for game B</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.410" end="00:41:17.190" style="s2">which I&#39;m still sitting with and dealing</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.819" end="00:41:19.619" style="s2">with how to do it in a group how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.190" end="00:41:23.400" style="s2">communicate it how to do any of that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.619" end="00:41:26.459" style="s2">that even in this game B space there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.400" end="00:41:28.410" style="s2">lot of somewhat needing to already be</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.459" end="00:41:30.839" style="s2">successful right you need to have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.410" end="00:41:32.999" style="s2">education you need to be articulate mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.839" end="00:41:35.190" style="s2">to have certain things that other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.999" end="00:41:37.170" style="s2">i luckily do have access to that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.190" end="00:41:40.499" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have access that other</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.170" end="00:41:42.479" style="s2">people have access to um and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.499" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">just what was coming up for me and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.479" end="00:41:47.900" style="s2">i said i will sit with that further what</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:47.900" style="s2">a success mean for game a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.770" end="00:41:56.950" style="s2">it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.730" end="00:42:01.220" style="s2">we are comprised of many components in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.950" end="00:42:04.010" style="s2">the psyche and if that&#39;s the case can</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.220" end="00:42:07.430" style="s2">some of us be ready as in some parts of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.010" end="00:42:09.460" style="s2">us be ready to play a game a well some</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.430" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">other parts are ready to play game B</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.460" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">what does that leave us with</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.330" end="00:42:16.390" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.840" end="00:42:20.900" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.560" end="00:43:36.660" style="s2">I agree with the challenges of like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.400" end="00:43:36.660" style="s2">need to come in there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.580" end="00:43:54.420" style="s2">there&#39;s hide ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.220" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.330" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">um hopefully this is coherent I feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">called to say that and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:23.990" style="s2">discussion with a friend who was trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:30.080" style="s2">to also become a candy player and I he</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.990" end="00:44:32.870" style="s2">told me that he had to release being a</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.080" end="00:44:36.650" style="s2">game a player and a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.870" end="00:44:44.390" style="s2">he was learning in game be to be applied</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.650" end="00:44:47.750" style="s2">to do really well in gaming and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.390" end="00:44:51.260" style="s2">as a pull on that a little bit it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.750" end="00:44:55.310" style="s2">me it feels like just in general we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.260" end="00:44:58.250" style="s2">all maybe trying to increase our impact</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.310" end="00:45:03.160" style="s2">or our value that we&#39;re creating for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.250" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">world it just happens that in game a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.160" end="00:45:10.010" style="s2">people are sucking that in in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:13.310" style="s2">for power or for money versus for game</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.010" end="00:45:17.290" style="s2">be it&#39;s more about letting it be not</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:21.560" style="s2">needing to be captured but it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.290" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">actually given to the whole so in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.560" end="00:45:27.620" style="s2">sense like I think each and one of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.270" style="s2">are in a kind of game a environment</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.620" end="00:45:32.660" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.270" end="00:45:37.730" style="s2">and while playing game B we can people</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.660" end="00:45:39.590" style="s2">can see us as kind of more beacons of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.730" end="00:45:41.270" style="s2">light where like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.590" end="00:45:43.340" style="s2">interesting about each and one of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.270" end="00:45:45.590" style="s2">because we&#39;re here and as we develop our</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:47.480" style="s2">own sovereignty and getting the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.590" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">relationships we&#39;re able to actually I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.480" end="00:45:55.460" style="s2">guess generate more I&#39;d say like value</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:46:00.040" style="s2">for those around us even though we may</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.460" end="00:46:04.220" style="s2">not be particularly capturing it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.040" end="00:46:09.069" style="s2">sort of be elevated even in the game a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.220" end="00:46:12.339" style="s2">space I really</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.069" end="00:46:15.699" style="s2">a couple things came to me the term</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.339" end="00:46:19.509" style="s2">emotional vampire and then this this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.699" end="00:46:21.729" style="s2">feminist motto personal is political and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.509" end="00:46:26.739" style="s2">if to repurpose that the relational is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.729" end="00:46:27.789" style="s2">political and like I teach interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.739" end="00:46:29.589" style="s2">skills that&#39;s what I do for livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.789" end="00:46:31.900" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been like researching all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.589" end="00:46:34.449" style="s2">kinds of different conversational</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.900" end="00:46:36.969" style="s2">modalities and if you&#39;ve kind of put it</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.449" end="00:46:38.650" style="s2">on a spectrum like I hit and then the I</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.969" end="00:46:40.929" style="s2">vow to use blueprint terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.650" end="00:46:42.729" style="s2">it&#39;s like pickup artists and stuff like</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.559" end="00:47:28.659" style="s2">the priest came and he just looked at me</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.759" end="00:47:40.839" style="s2">was like overflowing with presents and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.259" end="00:47:42.039" style="s2">he sort of liberated me from my my</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.179" end="00:47:54.089" style="s2">much we could not only liberate</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.249" end="00:47:54.089" style="s2">ourselves but liberate others</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.440" end="00:48:09.190" style="s2">I&#39;m sensing some some connect during</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.140" end="00:48:11.140" style="s2">what Tim shared about a sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.190" end="00:48:13.990" style="s2">know that the simultaneous playing both</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.140" end="00:48:16.630" style="s2">game a game B and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.990" end="00:48:20.170" style="s2">a discrete shift where I&#39;m suddenly a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.630" end="00:48:23.650" style="s2">game B player Solis there&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.170" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2">slow transformation at least uh pieces</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.650" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">of me to begin to lean into and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:32.820" style="s2">connects with me I believe it was what</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">Chad shared about how do we transmute</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.820" end="00:48:39.220" style="s2">like game a 2 2 game B it has something</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:41.369" style="s2">to do with that it feels like in the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.220" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">niche the the place that we are feels so</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.369" end="00:48:47.590" style="s2">the world as we conceived of it and all</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:52.510" style="s2">the rules and everything that is is so</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.590" end="00:48:55.570" style="s2">deeply controlled or conditioned by</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.510" end="00:48:57.550" style="s2">culture and we have some say in creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.570" end="00:48:59.850" style="s2">new artifacts of culture at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.550" end="00:49:02.560" style="s2">experimenting with new ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.850" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">so when I connect that with what Tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.560" end="00:49:10.270" style="s2">sharing my senses how can i I try these</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">things on and essentially the more that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.270" end="00:49:15.490" style="s2">we can mean into this game B space the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:17.619" style="s2">more playing field we create for others</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.490" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">so that they perhaps becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.619" end="00:49:27.010" style="s2">accessible and and so and so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:28.060" style="s2">of what I&#39;m connecting a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.010" end="00:49:31.260" style="s2">things came up for me when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.060" end="00:49:33.730" style="s2">sharing that like one of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.260" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">surprisingly is the the term make</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.730" end="00:49:38.950" style="s2">mindfulness which for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:43.270" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard before it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.950" end="00:49:45.970" style="s2">critique on how I guess like modern</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.270" end="00:49:49.510" style="s2">Western society has adopted meditation</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.970" end="00:49:51.490" style="s2">practices and the way I understand it or</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.510" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">the piece of it that has been useful for</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.490" end="00:49:55.810" style="s2">me is the realization that when people</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.390" style="s2">learn about the utility of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.810" end="00:50:01.390" style="s2">they think in terms of utility and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.390" end="00:50:03.609" style="s2">schedule like 30 minutes a day you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.390" end="00:50:05.020" style="s2">if they&#39;re good to meditate maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.609" end="00:50:08.500" style="s2">mornings before they go to work or</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.020" end="00:50:10.950" style="s2">something like that and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.500" end="00:50:13.609" style="s2">just kind of the way we tend to fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.950" end="00:50:18.749" style="s2">you know we we have slots and then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.609" end="00:50:20.910" style="s2">add something to that slot and that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.749" end="00:50:24.749" style="s2">is a there&#39;s a whole set of assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.910" end="00:50:26.309" style="s2">that make life like that and maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.749" end="00:50:28.140" style="s2">comes from having a nine-to-five or</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.309" end="00:50:31.289" style="s2">having kind of a discrete boundary</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.140" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">between weekdays and weekends and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.289" end="00:50:34.920" style="s2">related idea is this feeling that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:37.859" style="s2">had where I can still remember what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:39.450" style="s2">was like to not actually know that a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.859" end="00:50:41.579" style="s2">weekend was a different thing from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.450" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">weekday in that sense of expansiveness</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.579" end="00:50:47.970" style="s2">that I felt as a child where it was just</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:50.910" style="s2">life and there were no discrete</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.970" end="00:50:52.829" style="s2">boundaries between things so to connect</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.910" end="00:50:54.420" style="s2">that with the rest of the discussion it</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.829" end="00:50:55.890" style="s2">makes me my first thought when hearing</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.420" end="00:50:57.329" style="s2">what everybody was saying was maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.890" end="00:51:00.539" style="s2">way to play game B while we&#39;re still in</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.329" end="00:51:02.609" style="s2">game a is to negotiate these small slots</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.539" end="00:51:04.890" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s like some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.609" end="00:51:07.499" style="s2">liminal sacred space that come in and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.890" end="00:51:11.039" style="s2">you play a game be in that space and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.499" end="00:51:12.779" style="s2">get to practice it and you get to build</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.039" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">your game B muscles so to speak and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.779" end="00:51:17.489" style="s2">maybe at some point it&#39;ll start bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">into the rest of your life but then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.489" end="00:51:20.430" style="s2">counterpoint came up which was this Mick</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:23.339" style="s2">mindfulness thing which is maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.430" end="00:51:25.499" style="s2">that&#39;s fundamentally the wrong model and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.339" end="00:51:28.349" style="s2">maybe to think of it as something to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.499" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">just fit in to the existing way that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.349" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">do things is is is just flawed</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">completely and what we really need is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:39.569" style="s2">to kind of completely re-evaluate how we</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:43.529" style="s2">even think about our time we think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.569" end="00:51:45.720" style="s2">time itself Danya that reminds me of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.529" end="00:51:48.089" style="s2">very wise woman who I spend some time</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.720" end="00:51:49.619" style="s2">with who just asked the question what</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.089" end="00:51:52.279" style="s2">would happen if we treated every moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.619" end="00:51:52.279" style="s2">as if it mattered</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.780" end="00:51:54.840" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.990" end="00:52:00.050" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.120" end="00:52:08.620" style="s2">so something&#39;s come up for me as this</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.760" end="00:52:10.600" style="s2">discussions going on especially with</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.620" end="00:52:12.970" style="s2">relation to the Mik mindfulness comment</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.600" end="00:52:15.220" style="s2">as well as what Peter was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.970" end="00:52:17.290" style="s2">with the priest I know I&#39;ll see I hope</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.220" end="00:52:21.400" style="s2">hopefully I can I can articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.290" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">well but it reminds me of something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.400" end="00:52:24.760" style="s2">a friend of mine very recently said to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.290" style="s2">me when I was sort of talking about my</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.760" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">worries about trying to get like my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.290" end="00:52:31.540" style="s2">life sorted out and everything and he</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:32.950" style="s2">said well you know look why don&#39;t you if</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.540" end="00:52:34.270" style="s2">you&#39;re if you feel like you&#39;re spinning</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.950" end="00:52:35.560" style="s2">your wheels why don&#39;t you just go and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.270" end="00:52:37.030" style="s2">help people because if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.560" end="00:52:38.710" style="s2">stuck with you know you&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.030" end="00:52:40.120" style="s2">figure out how to fix certain situations</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.710" end="00:52:41.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re in your life and you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.120" end="00:52:45.250" style="s2">bunch of time then just spend it on</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.560" end="00:52:47.260" style="s2">other people and it kind of messed me up</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.250" end="00:52:49.510" style="s2">in the head because I it never occurred</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.260" end="00:52:52.540" style="s2">to me why that wasn&#39;t just so obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.510" end="00:52:55.030" style="s2">me to begin with and then I thought more</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.540" end="00:52:57.370" style="s2">about it and in relation with Peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.030" end="00:53:00.850" style="s2">comment about his like the very the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.370" end="00:53:03.550" style="s2">godly man who is the priest I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.850" end="00:53:06.010" style="s2">people really really vastly</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.550" end="00:53:08.710" style="s2">underestimate the sort of spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.010" end="00:53:13.270" style="s2">material power and charisma associated</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.710" end="00:53:16.540" style="s2">with people who are truly selflessly</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.270" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">motivated in what they do and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.540" end="00:53:22.030" style="s2">bit of a game a error which is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:23.770" style="s2">people overestimate their abilities to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.030" end="00:53:25.210" style="s2">sort of calculate how everything will</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.770" end="00:53:29.170" style="s2">turn out for them out into the future</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:33.880" style="s2">and underestimate how the world will</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.170" end="00:53:37.690" style="s2">sort of form itself around helping you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.880" end="00:53:39.850" style="s2">to succeed as you put more and more</p>

<p begin="00:53:39.850" end="00:53:43.050" style="s2">succeed at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.190" end="00:53:52.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of thread that I feel</p>

<p begin="00:54:04.740" end="00:54:08.520" style="s2">that it turned out that that Peter was</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.200" end="00:54:28.620" style="s2">precisely the opposite that it no longer</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.030" end="00:54:33.090" style="s2">needs to carry on there to take on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.620" end="00:54:38.370" style="s2">kind of zero-sum power quality but</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.110" end="00:54:43.740" style="s2">noticed in the MiG mindfulness comment</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.670" end="00:54:45.960" style="s2">and in the comment that that Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.840" end="00:55:37.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed a connection between some</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.300" end="00:55:40.660" style="s2">thoughts here I it seems that so one</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.450" end="00:55:43.470" style="s2">thing that I would say is a game a</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.130" end="00:56:03.019" style="s2">could put it and so I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.319" end="00:56:05.779" style="s2">there&#39;s some game v is rooted in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.019" end="00:56:08.359" style="s2">of pursuit for authenticity and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.779" end="00:56:11.390" style="s2">that&#39;s its authenticity both in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.359" end="00:56:17.410" style="s2">and what&#39;s actually happening between</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.390" end="00:56:20.630" style="s2">people and and I would say that for</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.309" end="00:56:46.579" style="s2">you eventually become more authentic</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.240" end="00:57:00.730" style="s2">that you can somewhat inherit the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.970" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">benefits of a different game without</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.730" end="00:57:06.460" style="s2">necessarily playing it yourself you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:09.829" style="s2">you can funnel these benefits into</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.460" end="00:57:15.099" style="s2">different possibly more authentic or</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.829" end="00:57:15.099" style="s2">productive ways of existing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.780" end="00:57:29.590" style="s2">I think one facet of the I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.400" end="00:57:33.090" style="s2">that interstitial point between you gay</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.590" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">and gay and gave me might just be in</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.090" end="00:57:39.280" style="s2">having the ability to when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.640" end="00:57:41.830" style="s2">those authentic moments identify them</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.280" end="00:57:46.890" style="s2">that you can kind of identify and gain a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.830" end="00:57:51.490" style="s2">situation versus again be situation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.890" end="00:57:53.260" style="s2">maybe think how this game a situation</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.490" end="00:57:55.900" style="s2">could have turned into my game a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.260" end="00:57:58.260" style="s2">situation how it could have been I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.900" end="00:58:03.580" style="s2">want to say optimized with that things</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.260" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">very game a but how social interactions</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.580" end="00:58:09.310" style="s2">but take on the flavor game a which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:10.930" style="s2">would say like he maybe like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.310" end="00:58:12.609" style="s2">being a bulldozer and another person</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.930" end="00:58:15.070" style="s2">thing that doormat or something of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.609" end="00:58:19.170" style="s2">nature could you know what&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.070" end="00:58:25.330" style="s2">that that interaction could on in a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.170" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">and here iris nonzero-sum way because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.330" end="00:58:30.369" style="s2">do think that for me</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:38.970" style="s2">this feels like something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.369" end="00:58:38.970" style="s2">between to a wider wave</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.600" end="00:58:46.790" style="s2">one phrase I heard recently that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:49.430" style="s2">that reminded me of is just noticing</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.790" end="00:58:53.120" style="s2">when meaning is being crowded out of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.430" end="00:58:55.160" style="s2">situation and that that&#39;s a good initial</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.120" end="00:58:58.120" style="s2">criterion for saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.160" end="00:58:58.120" style="s2">something&#39;s gone wrong here</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.030" end="00:59:04.460" style="s2">and this question of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.700" end="00:59:07.870" style="s2">I think is pretty critical to another</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.460" end="00:59:10.700" style="s2">word meaningfulness has come up and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.870" end="00:59:11.810" style="s2">there I think there is important I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.700" end="00:59:13.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction there another a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.810" end="00:59:16.250" style="s2">technical like philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.900" end="00:59:17.950" style="s2">distinctions but when I hear it there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.250" end="00:59:25.340" style="s2">something the difference to me is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.950" end="00:59:28.430" style="s2">meaning is something that is more well</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.340" end="00:59:36.320" style="s2">defined it&#39;s more goal oriented where</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.430" end="00:59:37.910" style="s2">meaningfulness is fluid and it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.320" end="00:59:40.190" style="s2">somebody can help with the teasing</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.910" end="00:59:43.270" style="s2">lasalle but there&#39;s a connection there</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.190" end="00:59:46.970" style="s2">with presence and authenticity that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.270" end="00:59:49.160" style="s2">makes it okay I pay attention to some</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.970" end="00:59:53.420" style="s2">things differently than if we&#39;re focused</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.160" end="00:59:55.490" style="s2">on meaning and Amy I think you said you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.420" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">work on aesthetics I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.490" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">hint there towards this TEDx to in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:03.470" style="s2">difference between something that&#39;s rife</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:05.570" style="s2">with or bereft of meaning versus</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.470" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">meaningfulness and have the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.570" end="01:00:13.300" style="s2">question really is directing us to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:13.300" style="s2">or live towards meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.150" end="01:00:20.369" style="s2">this same question came up at</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.359" end="01:00:22.019" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s meeting in Toronto and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.369" end="01:00:25.259" style="s2">meeting crisis were filled</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.019" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2">Jordan vo Jordan were were there and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.259" end="01:00:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like the idea of meaning and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:32.249" style="s2">the meaning of life is sort of almost a</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.880" end="01:00:34.529" style="s2">disembodied propositional question that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.249" end="01:00:37.079" style="s2">has like a yes or no answer to it where</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.529" end="01:00:38.970" style="s2">meaningfulness is like you&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.079" end="01:00:42.210" style="s2">meaning you know it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.970" end="01:00:49.829" style="s2">it grabs you as a felt sense state of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.210" end="01:00:52.279" style="s2">being can I jump Ilana a few threads</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.829" end="01:00:52.279" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.250" end="01:00:58.180" style="s2">so the question what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.320" end="01:01:02.860" style="s2">play a game B I think we can ask it at</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.180" end="01:01:04.660" style="s2">every level like within ourselves what</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.860" end="01:01:07.150" style="s2">does it mean to be non rival risks</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.660" end="01:01:08.320" style="s2">within ourselves as in the different</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.150" end="01:01:14.290" style="s2">parts that want to play different games</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.320" end="01:01:17.230" style="s2">and how do we make those parts non-rival</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.290" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">risks and there&#39;s also a threat about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.230" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.940" end="01:01:23.750" style="s2">finite games within infinite games some</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.950" end="01:01:26.570" style="s2">just note that and kind of set that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.750" end="01:01:30.350" style="s2">aside for a second but how do we play</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.570" end="01:01:31.970" style="s2">game be in our intimate relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.350" end="01:01:35.300" style="s2">with our families how do we play game D</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.970" end="01:01:38.540" style="s2">work how do we play game B in broader</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.300" end="01:01:40.730" style="s2">social situations how do we extend it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.540" end="01:01:45.740" style="s2">out and be non rival wrist and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.730" end="01:01:47.390" style="s2">still swimming in game a but I think we</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.740" end="01:01:53.320" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.390" end="01:01:56.410" style="s2">find ways to make choices that bring</p>

<p begin="01:02:16.620" end="01:02:25.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that where humanity sits</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.800" end="01:02:27.460" style="s2">right now is like we&#39;ve we have like the</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.970" end="01:04:03.190" style="s2">articulated about being anti rivalries</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.910" end="01:04:07.590" style="s2">across multiple levels and within</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.590" end="01:04:13.900" style="s2">kind of reminds me of self love or self</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.480" end="01:04:16.180" style="s2">parenting where you know there&#39;s part of</p>

<p begin="01:04:16.180" end="01:04:21.670" style="s2">there&#39;s part of you that wants path B</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.290" end="01:04:23.800" style="s2">and maybe B is the better path and your</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.670" end="01:04:27.070" style="s2">higher self so to speak knows that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.800" end="01:04:29.050" style="s2">so you you can kind of force that upon</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.070" end="01:04:31.150" style="s2">yourself in a non loving manner and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.050" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll see how far that gets to or you</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.150" end="01:04:34.840" style="s2">can approach the whole situation with</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:39.070" style="s2">maybe Compassion&#39;s a better word and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.840" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">that allows for that integration process</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.070" end="01:04:44.050" style="s2">to happen more naturally and I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:45.640" style="s2">then that also leads into relationships</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.050" end="01:04:47.860" style="s2">and I think this goes all the way back</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.640" end="01:04:49.270" style="s2">to Peters question initially which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.860" end="01:04:52.240" style="s2">what is the role of sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.270" end="01:04:55.780" style="s2">playing game B and I&#39;ll leave with this</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:58.360" style="s2">one comment I think my my definition of</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.360" end="01:05:05.050" style="s2">know that it involves an element of</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.190" end="01:05:07.660" style="s2">sacrifice and maybe to make that more</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.050" end="01:05:11.170" style="s2">tangible when you&#39;re having say conflict</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.660" end="01:05:14.140" style="s2">with a loved one the best chance you</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.170" end="01:05:15.970" style="s2">have achieving resolution across time is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.140" end="01:05:17.770" style="s2">to have buffer for one another buffer</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.360" end="01:05:23.110" style="s2">have buffer for you to do that as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.800" end="01:05:26.370" style="s2">and then doing that within yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.110" end="01:05:26.370" style="s2">then doing that across society</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.550" end="01:05:35.369" style="s2">when they&#39;ve done notion of up go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:39.390" style="s2">excuse me I think the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.369" end="01:05:42.020" style="s2">buffering is really interesting I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.390" end="01:05:42.020" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.839" end="01:05:51.049" style="s2">how we could take that on with respect</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.449" end="01:05:51.049" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.310" end="01:05:58.610" style="s2">this is a hard thing to say something to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.710" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">do with the nature of time</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.610" end="01:06:06.950" style="s2">because if game B is a city on a hill</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:09.790" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t think it quite is I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.950" end="01:06:12.620" style="s2">in fact it is a process ever unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.790" end="01:06:15.740" style="s2">but if we take it as a city on a hill</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.620" end="01:06:19.160" style="s2">just for a moment there&#39;s some path</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.740" end="01:06:24.110" style="s2">between here and there so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.160" end="01:06:26.600" style="s2">sort of transition and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.110" end="01:06:29.470" style="s2">mean with this parts of us here and</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.600" end="01:06:32.920" style="s2">there we&#39;re embedded in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.470" end="01:06:37.220" style="s2">from one context you may be able to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.920" end="01:06:40.820" style="s2">more in the mode of game be more more</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.220" end="01:06:43.610" style="s2">able to be loving and in others we might</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.820" end="01:06:45.620" style="s2">walk out and all of a sudden maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.610" end="01:06:47.990" style="s2">baseline fundamental bit of security</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.620" end="01:06:51.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t there eNOS if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.990" end="01:06:52.790" style="s2">something in you that is well-developed</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.080" end="01:06:56.660" style="s2">enough to protect yourself from a</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.790" end="01:07:00.250" style="s2">specific game a threat perhaps then what</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.660" end="01:07:00.250" style="s2">in your structure is compromised</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.350" end="01:07:05.690" style="s2">that might be necessary in order to be a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.050" end="01:07:08.740" style="s2">vehicle to continue moving towards the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.690" end="01:07:12.080" style="s2">city on the hill that is going to be so</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.740" end="01:07:13.700" style="s2">so this notion of buffering and time and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.080" end="01:07:17.570" style="s2">something else that I think is really</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.700" end="01:07:19.070" style="s2">important is is a practice being able in</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.570" end="01:07:21.470" style="s2">authenticity as part of it this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.070" end="01:07:24.980" style="s2">meaningfulness is part of it is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.470" end="01:07:26.869" style="s2">kind of way can we drop in its the</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.980" end="01:07:28.720" style="s2">cultivation of a practice that enables</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.869" end="01:07:32.390" style="s2">you to drop it into something that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.720" end="01:07:34.990" style="s2">somehow beneath between and above all of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.390" end="01:07:37.369" style="s2">that it&#39;s transcendent to all of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.990" end="01:07:41.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s nevertheless participatory</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.369" end="01:07:43.609" style="s2">which is the reese entering thing which</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.210" end="01:07:46.660" style="s2">enables somehow this orientation despite</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.609" end="01:07:51.560" style="s2">the putt despite the fact that there is</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.660" end="01:07:53.930" style="s2">the city on the hill that you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.560" end="01:07:55.460" style="s2">moving towards but not but not yet there</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.930" end="01:07:56.690" style="s2">and that seems like a broader point</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.460" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">regarding life but the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.690" end="01:08:00.290" style="s2">buffering and time it&#39;s is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:04.100" style="s2">as a sense of forgiveness there with</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.290" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">respect to how how much you are or are</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.100" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">not able to continue moving they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:14.119" style="s2">really feeling into some some notion of</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:16.250" style="s2">buffering and the period of time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.119" end="01:08:19.180" style="s2">considering this process to be unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.250" end="01:08:22.390" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just leave it with the question</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.180" end="01:08:22.390" style="s2">what if</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.420" end="01:08:27.640" style="s2">a successful game be even that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.840" end="01:08:28.810" style="s2">right way to say the question but but</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.640" end="01:08:32.050" style="s2">what if we were talking about something</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.810" end="01:08:35.350" style="s2">that&#39;s 200 years into the future what</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.050" end="01:08:37.990" style="s2">are we really playing then right if if</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.350" end="01:08:41.170" style="s2">if I get if a game B that is more fully</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.990" end="01:08:43.270" style="s2">present in the lives of some critical</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.170" end="01:08:46.300" style="s2">number of people such that it is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.270" end="01:08:49.450" style="s2">game that is being played more if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.300" end="01:08:56.980" style="s2">centuries into the future what really</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.450" end="01:08:58.510" style="s2">are we doing now little called to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.980" end="01:09:02.920" style="s2">something I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.510" end="01:09:06.510" style="s2">incorporate Tim&#39;s question to that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.920" end="01:09:08.770" style="s2">noticed the the the use of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.510" end="01:09:12.160" style="s2">quasi-religious language in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.770" end="01:09:14.230" style="s2">conversation and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.160" end="01:09:16.870" style="s2">bad thing I kind of want to also address</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.230" end="01:09:18.430" style="s2">Phil&#39;s original question about how do</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.870" end="01:09:23.080" style="s2">you create a religion it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.430" end="01:09:25.930" style="s2">religion and so for me when I come to to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.080" end="01:09:28.330" style="s2">these spaces to the the I thou spaces I</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.930" end="01:09:32.830" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m bringing a sacred a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.330" end="01:09:35.020" style="s2">sacred idea with me and so for me I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.830" end="01:09:36.820" style="s2">to put it I guess in a straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.020" end="01:09:41.890" style="s2">way it&#39;s to try to find the balance</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.820" end="01:09:44.650" style="s2">between science and religion and I want</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.890" end="01:09:49.830" style="s2">to uh and I want to engage with people</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.650" end="01:09:54.700" style="s2">while honoring that idea with me and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.830" end="01:09:58.060" style="s2">maybe how to play game B is to borrow a</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.700" end="01:09:59.890" style="s2">term from from Jesus is to to go make</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.060" end="01:10:02.920" style="s2">disciples of other people and so to try</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.890" end="01:10:06.450" style="s2">to create spaces where where other</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.920" end="01:10:11.020" style="s2">people can have like a sacred idea and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.450" end="01:10:15.790" style="s2">try to have conversations similar to</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.020" end="01:10:19.870" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing here it&#39;s why I&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.790" end="01:10:21.910" style="s2">the question if if maybe anyone else in</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.870" end="01:10:24.430" style="s2">the group feels like they bring like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.910" end="01:10:26.640" style="s2">sacred idea with them to these types of</p>

<p begin="01:13:49.730" end="01:13:55.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re having now entails opening</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.130" end="01:14:17.390" style="s2">relating and and I think meaning has</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.750" end="01:14:19.010" style="s2">that component as well where meaning is</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.390" end="01:14:21.080" style="s2">not a thing that you&#39;re gonna find kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.010" end="01:14:22.630" style="s2">of as a as Peter said is like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.080" end="01:14:25.580" style="s2">proposition that&#39;s out out in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.630" end="01:14:29.810" style="s2">nor is it something that you can have as</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.580" end="01:14:32.900" style="s2">a kind of isolated ego self it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.810" end="01:14:37.550" style="s2">emerges in the process of interaction</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.900" end="01:14:41.630" style="s2">with others with the world and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.550" end="01:14:45.310" style="s2">think that shift from kind of isolated</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.630" end="01:14:48.980" style="s2">selves and a world without without</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.310" end="01:14:50.930" style="s2">subjectivity to some conception of this</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.980" end="01:14:52.520" style="s2">ongoing process that is really the</p>

<p begin="01:14:52.520" end="01:14:58.810" style="s2">people in the world there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.760" end="01:14:58.810" style="s2">there for for game B</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.949" end="01:15:03.449" style="s2">feel compelled to just drop in the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.590" end="01:15:07.580" style="s2">concept of sacrifice again into</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.449" end="01:15:07.580" style="s2">everything that you just described Jake</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.230" end="01:15:14.600" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re mentioning sacrifice in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.840" end="01:15:16.820" style="s2">context of love made me think you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.600" end="01:15:22.070" style="s2">this is the sacrifice that love entails</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.820" end="01:15:24.200" style="s2">is opening yourself to the other so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.070" end="01:15:24.770" style="s2">think of that oh do you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.200" end="01:15:27.890" style="s2">George</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.770" end="01:15:33.470" style="s2">hey just very shortly I just I hear</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.890" end="01:15:35.060" style="s2">sacrifice but I I feel altruism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.470" end="01:15:37.850" style="s2">to say that you are necessarily harming</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.060" end="01:15:40.700" style="s2">yourself sometimes it is not to your</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.850" end="01:15:44.300" style="s2">benefit but like altruism might be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.700" end="01:15:47.030" style="s2">better fit for that idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.300" end="01:15:50.150" style="s2">I kind of feel an affinity for sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.030" end="01:15:52.550" style="s2">because it it involves a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.150" end="01:15:55.370" style="s2">of like letting go of yourself so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.550" end="01:15:58.280" style="s2">can think of it as as harm but not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.370" end="01:16:00.200" style="s2">not necessarily harm people use the term</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.280" end="01:16:02.150" style="s2">self transcendence and you could even</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.200" end="01:16:03.920" style="s2">think of that as you&#39;re renegotiating</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.150" end="01:16:06.050" style="s2">what the self is by making these micro</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.920" end="01:16:07.640" style="s2">sacrifices across time whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.050" end="01:16:10.070" style="s2">through an interaction with someone</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.640" end="01:16:10.970" style="s2">that&#39;s characterized by love or towards</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.070" end="01:16:12.860" style="s2">something that you describe as</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.970" end="01:16:14.030" style="s2">meaningful and I think encountering</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.860" end="01:16:16.340" style="s2">something that is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.030" end="01:16:18.290" style="s2">perhaps necessitates a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.340" end="01:16:19.820" style="s2">that self transformation but the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.290" end="01:16:22.040" style="s2">transform you got to sacrifice one</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.820" end="01:16:23.320" style="s2">aspect of yourself in favor of what&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.040" end="01:16:26.660" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.320" end="01:16:28.760" style="s2">okay so especially because you guys have</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.660" end="01:16:31.970" style="s2">been talking about sacrifice I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.760" end="01:16:33.680" style="s2">thinking about this level of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.970" end="01:16:38.870" style="s2">sacred ideas that have a relation to</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.680" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">this and I&#39;m reminded of the apart from</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.870" end="01:16:43.160" style="s2">the Sermon on the Mount which is one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:45.950" style="s2">like Jesus&#39;s famous speeches where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.160" end="01:16:48.860" style="s2">instructing people essentially to stop</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.950" end="01:16:53.510" style="s2">worrying about their internal material</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.860" end="01:16:55.850" style="s2">needs basically because if you according</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.510" end="01:16:57.560" style="s2">to him align yourself with God which I</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.850" end="01:17:00.500" style="s2">think in the context of this</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.560" end="01:17:02.240" style="s2">conversation is very much like aligning</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.500" end="01:17:04.850" style="s2">yourself with important higher ideals</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.240" end="01:17:07.220" style="s2">and then being less concerned about your</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.850" end="01:17:09.440" style="s2">own internal day-to-day sort of issues</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.220" end="01:17:12.470" style="s2">that he says that like God will clothe</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.440" end="01:17:15.170" style="s2">and feed you if you actually seriously</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.470" end="01:17:18.200" style="s2">dedicate yourself to what you think is</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.170" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">like the most valuable and it makes me</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.200" end="01:17:24.170" style="s2">think again that of a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.960" end="01:17:26.240" style="s2">I know are very successful at game a at</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.170" end="01:17:28.250" style="s2">game a who are aligning themselves</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.240" end="01:17:32.030" style="s2">strongly with higher ideals and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.250" end="01:17:35.330" style="s2">see their mission as being ultimately to</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.030" end="01:17:37.070" style="s2">sort of like ascend the hierarchy so</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.330" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">somebody like Elon Musk is a really good</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.070" end="01:17:42.200" style="s2">example but there&#39;s tons tons more</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:44.870" style="s2">examples so I guess something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.200" end="01:17:48.740" style="s2">wondering is again back on this this</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.870" end="01:17:51.710" style="s2">idea where I really do think that people</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.740" end="01:17:53.060" style="s2">are under estimating even there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.710" end="01:17:54.500" style="s2">question that near the beginning where</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.060" end="01:17:56.360" style="s2">people are asking well do you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.500" end="01:17:57.890" style="s2">good at game a in order to succeed at</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.360" end="01:18:00.560" style="s2">game B and</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.890" end="01:18:03.140" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering are we not maybe we should</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.560" end="01:18:05.720" style="s2">ask to what degree is game be actually a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.140" end="01:18:08.750" style="s2">like an extremely excellent sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.720" end="01:18:10.640" style="s2">strategy for game a and that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.750" end="01:18:14.450" style="s2">willing to sort of make that leap of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.640" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">faith and sacrifice in that way what</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.450" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">what kind of a future does that yield</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.400" end="01:18:28.900" style="s2">something that comes to me there is one</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.460" end="01:18:28.900" style="s2">of continued sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.889" end="01:18:36.520" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of the trickery that can</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.300" end="01:18:39.250" style="s2">sometimes happen in words which I</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.520" end="01:18:40.840" style="s2">suspect is probably quite intentional as</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.250" end="01:18:42.580" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about the feeling that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.840" end="01:18:44.739" style="s2">have when I hear the word sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.580" end="01:18:47.170" style="s2">then I reflect on its etymology which</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.739" end="01:18:49.060" style="s2">simply means to make sacred and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.170" end="01:18:51.219" style="s2">sacrifice is the act of turning a</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.060" end="01:18:52.949" style="s2">particular activity into something</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.219" end="01:18:55.330" style="s2">that&#39;s participating in this sacred and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.949" end="01:18:57.340" style="s2">then I was noticing that I had an image</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.330" end="01:18:59.350" style="s2">in my mind and I sort of spent a little</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.340" end="01:19:01.480" style="s2">time hunting it down and realized that</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.350" end="01:19:04.510" style="s2">it was a documentary I&#39;d watched</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.480" end="01:19:06.850" style="s2">sometime ago about a family that for</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.510" end="01:19:10.600" style="s2">three generations had been carving a</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.850" end="01:19:13.239" style="s2">particular piece of the cathedral in</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.600" end="01:19:16.360" style="s2">Barcelona and about how there was a</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.239" end="01:19:18.820" style="s2">feeling of careful care like for three</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.360" end="01:19:19.929" style="s2">generations each individual had given me</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.820" end="01:19:21.280" style="s2">essentially their total dove there to</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.929" end="01:19:23.590" style="s2">tell it to their life to this particular</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.280" end="01:19:25.690" style="s2">practice and then I remember the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.590" end="01:19:29.679" style="s2">conversation that I had with Jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.690" end="01:19:30.909" style="s2">about the platform the the vision the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.679" end="01:19:34.239" style="s2">thing that she&#39;s holding and I was just</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.909" end="01:19:35.830" style="s2">wondering it would be like if a group of</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.239" end="01:19:37.480" style="s2">people had attached themselves to that</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.830" end="01:19:40.170" style="s2">particular project with that level of</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.480" end="01:19:40.170" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.820" end="01:19:48.760" style="s2">I mean that would be amazing</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.320" end="01:19:51.070" style="s2">there&#39;s one who has that level of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.760" end="01:19:53.500" style="s2">sacrifice at the moment and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.070" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">the word sacrifice doesn&#39;t appeal to me</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.500" end="01:19:58.230" style="s2">except in the way that you just defined</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:20:00.280" style="s2">it Jordan because I think of my</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.230" end="01:20:02.980" style="s2">evangelical Christian upbringing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.280" end="01:20:06.220" style="s2">brings about well just a negative</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.980" end="01:20:07.690" style="s2">connotation and what I&#39;ve been in in</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.220" end="01:20:10.030" style="s2">this moment I mean I came up with this</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.690" end="01:20:12.670" style="s2">idea three years ago and I&#39;ve had to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.030" end="01:20:14.440" style="s2">the interpersonal work after that to get</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.670" end="01:20:18.400" style="s2">to become the person that could possibly</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.440" end="01:20:23.050" style="s2">bring it into the world and a big piece</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.400" end="01:20:25.600" style="s2">of it is not sacrificing is my natural</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.050" end="01:20:28.120" style="s2">self is empathetic and wants to give my</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.600" end="01:20:30.760" style="s2">whole self up to the group and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.120" end="01:20:34.440" style="s2">to learn to do the opposite which has</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.760" end="01:20:37.420" style="s2">been so instrumental finding that in</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.440" end="01:20:40.420" style="s2">finding my own joy what is easy for me</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.420" end="01:20:42.940" style="s2">and simple for me because in a group</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.420" end="01:20:44.380" style="s2">that same piece it&#39;s easy and simple for</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.940" end="01:20:46.840" style="s2">me it&#39;s hard for somebody else and vice</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.380" end="01:20:49.140" style="s2">versa and I don&#39;t remember who was</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.840" end="01:20:53.410" style="s2">speaking but someone was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.140" end="01:20:57.670" style="s2">utility and I just reminded me of</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.410" end="01:20:59.620" style="s2">watching the in community these parents</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.670" end="01:21:01.090" style="s2">playing sports with their kids and there</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.620" end="01:21:02.920" style="s2">was like dad&#39;s playing whose kids</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.090" end="01:21:05.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t playing that was like oh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.920" end="01:21:07.090" style="s2">enjoying that process and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.200" end="01:21:09.070" style="s2">piece of me that was I hate playing</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.090" end="01:21:12.550" style="s2">sports hate it with a passion but I</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.070" end="01:21:14.950" style="s2">would do it for my kid and yet I like it</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.550" end="01:21:16.690" style="s2">I like shook my world because I was like</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.950" end="01:21:18.520" style="s2">oh there&#39;s things that I hate that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.690" end="01:21:20.920" style="s2">actually really enjoy and in community</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.520" end="01:21:22.120" style="s2">how that works because my kid if she</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.920" end="01:21:25.330" style="s2">wants to play sports can play sports</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.120" end="01:21:28.750" style="s2">with them and vice versa where part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.330" end="01:21:30.730" style="s2">it is letting go of the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.750" end="01:21:33.580" style="s2">because somebody else that is not a</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.730" end="01:21:36.120" style="s2">sacrifice for and instead finding your</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.580" end="01:21:38.920" style="s2">purpose and your utility and your flow</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.120" end="01:21:40.270" style="s2">because when you find it there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.920" end="01:21:42.040" style="s2">sacrifice there at least not how the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.270" end="01:21:43.930" style="s2">negative connotation the positive</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.040" end="01:21:47.920" style="s2">connotation of dedicating your life to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.930" end="01:21:49.660" style="s2">something and finding what speaks to you</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.920" end="01:21:51.970" style="s2">and what brings you joy I think is</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.660" end="01:21:56.810" style="s2">playing and be and enough people doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.970" end="01:21:58.730" style="s2">that in some kind of a organized way</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.810" end="01:22:01.880" style="s2">I have in my head but any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.730" end="01:22:04.730" style="s2">organized way of like doing what is in</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.880" end="01:22:07.070" style="s2">your best interest but having it be Omni</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.730" end="01:22:10.120" style="s2">when where and that is where game a</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.070" end="01:22:13.610" style="s2">falls apart is that a lot of what is</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.120" end="01:22:16.460" style="s2">utility and what is I get it and other</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.610" end="01:22:18.290" style="s2">people don&#39;t and in game B I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.460" end="01:22:20.690" style="s2">I get it so I can give it to everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.290" end="01:22:21.470" style="s2">else you get it so you can give it to</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.690" end="01:22:23.630" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.470" end="01:22:24.890" style="s2">and the more we play in that and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.630" end="01:22:27.440" style="s2">more we give ourselves those little</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.890" end="01:22:29.510" style="s2">slotted times to play in that the easier</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.440" end="01:22:32.330" style="s2">it becomes because I&#39;ve experienced it</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.510" end="01:22:34.190" style="s2">like I experienced living mostly in game</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.330" end="01:22:36.260" style="s2">beep I just had to come at it from a</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.190" end="01:22:40.250" style="s2">more selfish point because it was if</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.260" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">that&#39;s making any sense and I will stop</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.250" end="01:22:43.630" style="s2">talking now because I could talk about</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:48.480" style="s2">this forever</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.630" end="01:22:48.480" style="s2">mmm Gordon when I</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.919" end="01:22:54.959" style="s2">on the apology of sacrifice to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.280" end="01:22:58.019" style="s2">sacred I need to be thought back to when</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.959" end="01:23:02.789" style="s2">you shared what if every moment mattered</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.019" end="01:23:05.780" style="s2">and that and that also connected me to</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.789" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">what you shared Peter the pastor who</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.780" end="01:23:11.369" style="s2">communicated to you as if he was holding</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:13.079" style="s2">that that sacredness and in that</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.369" end="01:23:14.699" style="s2">interaction that he had with you Peter</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.079" end="01:23:18.929" style="s2">feels somewhat like what you were just</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.699" end="01:23:20.699" style="s2">describing Jubilee Ian he is in touch</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.929" end="01:23:23.760" style="s2">with something that he was able to give</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.699" end="01:23:27.510" style="s2">to to Peter in a certain kinda way and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.760" end="01:23:30.169" style="s2">I&#39;m sensing connecting to this this</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.510" end="01:23:32.939" style="s2">sense of a sacred idea when I when I</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.169" end="01:23:38.639" style="s2">tossed that around in my mind the sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.939" end="01:23:42.959" style="s2">of there are many paths of change that</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.639" end="01:23:45.599" style="s2">are fueled by a deep hatred or distaste</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.959" end="01:23:48.329" style="s2">swear things as they exist and are</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.599" end="01:23:50.459" style="s2">reasons to have distaste for the things</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.329" end="01:23:56.369" style="s2">is the way that they are that I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.459" end="01:24:00.449" style="s2">that there is a need for coming up</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.369" end="01:24:02.880" style="s2">against the sanctity of life and finding</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.449" end="01:24:04.949" style="s2">finding yourself in the position where</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.880" end="01:24:08.039" style="s2">independent of what&#39;s going on and do</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.949" end="01:24:11.189" style="s2">you recognize the privilege of being</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.039" end="01:24:17.209" style="s2">alive and from that place we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.189" end="01:24:20.039" style="s2">on solid ground from which to move and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.209" end="01:24:23.570" style="s2">have to bring up when I was there</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.039" end="01:24:26.010" style="s2">intended to speak some time ago</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.570" end="01:24:29.669" style="s2">sharing the peace around the time scale</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.010" end="01:24:32.010" style="s2">I had this image of like seeds falling</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.669" end="01:24:34.280" style="s2">in through cracks on a sidewalk and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.010" end="01:24:37.949" style="s2">imagining that fast forward through time</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.280" end="01:24:40.610" style="s2">tree is growing out of that space and</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.949" end="01:24:44.340" style="s2">then asking myself the question what</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.610" end="01:24:46.519" style="s2">what are seeds like that I can plant in</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.340" end="01:24:46.519" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.999" end="01:24:51.860" style="s2">Oh grow and that way I&#39;m having good</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.300" end="01:24:56.179" style="s2">answers but it felt beautiful to</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.860" end="01:25:00.469" style="s2">consider what keeps coming up for me is</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.179" end="01:25:02.989" style="s2">art and there&#39;s this philipp reis term</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.469" end="01:25:05.780" style="s2">called death works which i really like</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.989" end="01:25:08.389" style="s2">it&#39;s like works of art that are meant to</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.780" end="01:25:09.889" style="s2">undermine the sacred of society right so</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.389" end="01:25:11.869" style="s2">you can think of like stuff like piss</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.889" end="01:25:16.340" style="s2">art or piss Christ or you know Katy</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.869" end="01:25:19.369" style="s2">Perry or porn things that remove the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.340" end="01:25:23.479" style="s2">sacred which remove community or</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.369" end="01:25:25.610" style="s2">communion so if there&#39;s a no how matter</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.479" end="01:25:29.239" style="s2">if there&#39;s an opposite of death works</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.610" end="01:25:30.920" style="s2">like life works and what comes first is</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.239" end="01:25:33.559" style="s2">the community come first and then the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.920" end="01:25:35.840" style="s2">life works emerge from it or is it the</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.559" end="01:25:39.260" style="s2">other way around or is it kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.840" end="01:25:42.469" style="s2">co-creating process and if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.260" end="01:25:44.659" style="s2">case what is the work of art that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.469" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">want to co-create together is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.659" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">question that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.860" end="01:25:57.820" style="s2">it is beautiful Peter that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.829" end="01:26:00.309" style="s2">interesting I am I wrote a very similar</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.820" end="01:26:02.619" style="s2">sentence yesterday to someone I know</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.309" end="01:26:10.329" style="s2">here who I just consider a thoroughbred</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.619" end="01:26:14.559" style="s2">wizard and and I don&#39;t know but but my</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.329" end="01:26:18.520" style="s2">sense is involves it involves more than</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.559" end="01:26:24.059" style="s2">just the modality of speech although</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.520" end="01:26:28.320" style="s2">listening will always be present so my</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.059" end="01:26:34.630" style="s2">aspiration is to open somehow this</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.320" end="01:26:40.420" style="s2">shared collaboration in a space where</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.630" end="01:26:43.300" style="s2">musicians artists draws you know the to</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.420" end="01:26:45.719" style="s2">resonate on on that kind of scale and</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.300" end="01:26:48.670" style="s2">what can be created there so I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.719" end="01:26:52.199" style="s2">what other a question from that might be</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.670" end="01:26:56.170" style="s2">what other modalities of coming together</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.199" end="01:26:58.619" style="s2">might best afford this co-creation of</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.170" end="01:26:58.619" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.460" end="01:27:01.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.679" end="01:27:08.739" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.460" end="01:27:11.670" style="s2">in a way this feels like a piece of art</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.739" end="01:27:11.670" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.500" end="01:27:19.610" style="s2">one thing coming up for me because both</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.480" end="01:27:23.840" style="s2">both art and and time have been</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.610" end="01:27:26.119" style="s2">mentioned it was a filmmaking is</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.840" end="01:27:27.980" style="s2">something that I do and and the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.119" end="01:27:32.239" style="s2">deepest experiences I&#39;ve had in</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.980" end="01:27:33.800" style="s2">filmmaking or in watching films kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:36.610" style="s2">orient me in terms of what I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.800" end="01:27:39.110" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for in in this general space</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.610" end="01:27:41.659" style="s2">because they are those experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.110" end="01:27:45.110" style="s2">kind of total presence and total</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.659" end="01:27:49.309" style="s2">engagement and I think a lot of that has</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.110" end="01:27:51.380" style="s2">to do with how it how a film can orient</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.309" end="01:27:53.480" style="s2">you in time where you&#39;re in the film is</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.380" end="01:27:54.679" style="s2">a foregone conclusion it&#39;s gonna end</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.480" end="01:27:57.290" style="s2">however it&#39;s gonna end but your</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.679" end="01:28:00.079" style="s2">experience of it is moment by moment by</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.290" end="01:28:02.690" style="s2">moment by moment very much very much in</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.079" end="01:28:05.469" style="s2">the present and and it occurred to me I</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.690" end="01:28:08.840" style="s2">heard a conversation between</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.469" end="01:28:12.489" style="s2">Krishnamurti and and David Bohm</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.840" end="01:28:12.489" style="s2">called the ending of time and</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.790" end="01:28:16.369" style="s2">Krishnamurti keeps making this point</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.630" end="01:28:19.579" style="s2">over and over again that the conception</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.369" end="01:28:22.309" style="s2">of time that we have in in the physical</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.579" end="01:28:23.570" style="s2">world of this there&#39;s now and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.309" end="01:28:25.940" style="s2">there&#39;s the future and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.570" end="01:28:27.790" style="s2">past and and there can be</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.940" end="01:28:30.820" style="s2">transformations that happen over time</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.790" end="01:28:35.030" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work for a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.820" end="01:28:38.360" style="s2">time to create that distinction in one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.030" end="01:28:39.440" style="s2">in one&#39;s own mind is the this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.360" end="01:28:42.760" style="s2">seed from which all these different</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.440" end="01:28:44.989" style="s2">pathologies spring and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.760" end="01:28:47.059" style="s2">there&#39;s something about these</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.989" end="01:28:49.400" style="s2">conversations that that give us an</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.059" end="01:28:51.590" style="s2">orientation toward time that that</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.400" end="01:28:54.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t create that kind of fracturing</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.590" end="01:28:57.460" style="s2">and I think think art has that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.099" end="01:28:57.460" style="s2">potential as well</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.810" end="01:29:06.250" style="s2">that has me thinking of making art and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.090" end="01:29:11.980" style="s2">the experience of making art painting is</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.250" end="01:29:14.860" style="s2">where I started and it was actually the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.980" end="01:29:18.910" style="s2">experience of feeling like this didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.860" end="01:29:21.940" style="s2">come from me it came through me that</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.910" end="01:29:25.120" style="s2">brought me to to meditation like this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.940" end="01:29:26.860" style="s2">this is I didn&#39;t make that that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.120" end="01:29:29.500" style="s2">come from me where in me did that come</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.860" end="01:29:32.230" style="s2">from but that to be a vessel or a</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.500" end="01:29:38.350" style="s2">conduit through which life can flow in</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.230" end="01:29:40.810" style="s2">which art can flow is the goal to be a</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.350" end="01:29:49.630" style="s2">good vessel or a good conduit through</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.810" end="01:29:51.130" style="s2">which life can flow and think of I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.630" end="01:29:52.489" style="s2">come back to it I&#39;ll leave it there for</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.130" end="01:29:54.889" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.489" end="01:29:56.449" style="s2">just wanted to say as it brought forward</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.889" end="01:29:58.280" style="s2">to me that that that is not how I feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.449" end="01:29:59.960" style="s2">about art because I&#39;m not an artist but</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.280" end="01:30:03.440" style="s2">it is how I feel about this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.960" end="01:30:06.739" style="s2">I&#39;m creating that it&#39;s coming through me</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.440" end="01:30:08.300" style="s2">for some reason it&#39;s me that it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.739" end="01:30:11.480" style="s2">through because of my life experience</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.300" end="01:30:14.840" style="s2">and in experiencing that it is not mine</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.480" end="01:30:17.330" style="s2">it is ours because it was brought on</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.840" end="01:30:19.070" style="s2">from all of my teachers and every</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.330" end="01:30:22.610" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve had through everyone</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.070" end="01:30:25.040" style="s2">else and I think that is game B that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.610" end="01:30:27.290" style="s2">why we&#39;re able to have omni win is like</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.040" end="01:30:30.199" style="s2">anything that&#39;s created was created with</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.290" end="01:30:31.969" style="s2">the whole and therefore you can&#39;t own it</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.199" end="01:30:34.550" style="s2">in the same way that it&#39;s owned in game</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.969" end="01:30:36.500" style="s2">a if I took all the risk and I did it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.550" end="01:30:38.840" style="s2">like even if I did take all the risk</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.500" end="01:30:40.429" style="s2">even if I did all the work you still</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.840" end="01:30:43.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t take all the risk and you still</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.429" end="01:30:45.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t do all the work and so owning</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.310" end="01:30:48.500" style="s2">that and being in that of like this</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.110" end="01:30:50.869" style="s2">thing and then being a servant of it</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.500" end="01:30:53.480" style="s2">being like okay letting ego take the</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.869" end="01:30:56.960" style="s2">back the back seat and being like okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.480" end="01:30:59.270" style="s2">what can I do to move this forward what</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.960" end="01:31:01.099" style="s2">is in the best within my capacity to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.270" end="01:31:03.650" style="s2">a better person today to do something</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.099" end="01:31:06.500" style="s2">for the whole to do something for this</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.650" end="01:31:08.449" style="s2">vision that I have to do something what</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.500" end="01:31:10.190" style="s2">is the best thing that I can do to move</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.449" end="01:31:13.639" style="s2">it forward which isn&#39;t not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.190" end="01:31:15.830" style="s2">what society looks at from gamei and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.639" end="01:31:18.590" style="s2">says that is the next step make a</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.830" end="01:31:20.480" style="s2">business plan do X to Y instead of like</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.590" end="01:31:21.980" style="s2">no what&#39;s my next step what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.480" end="01:31:24.699" style="s2">thing to do because that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.980" end="01:31:24.699" style="s2">spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.260" end="01:31:33.340" style="s2">can you hear me</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.650" end="01:31:37.420" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re reaching the point where</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.340" end="01:31:38.950" style="s2">it&#39;s time to start closing and it seems</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.420" end="01:31:43.510" style="s2">like we might be nice is for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.950" end="01:31:45.340" style="s2">just to have a chance to reflect on how</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.510" end="01:31:48.010" style="s2">they&#39;ve changed as a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.340" end="01:31:50.920" style="s2">conversation and maybe just share if</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.010" end="01:31:55.090" style="s2">there&#39;s anything that is the question</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.920" end="01:31:57.220" style="s2">that they&#39;re leaving with perhaps is</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.090" end="01:32:00.340" style="s2">being moved through the course of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.220" end="01:32:04.660" style="s2">conversation I can say for myself that</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.340" end="01:32:07.560" style="s2">in just the last little bit the question</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.660" end="01:32:10.630" style="s2">that landed on me quite heavily actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.560" end="01:32:12.850" style="s2">if this inquiry into the notion of a</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.630" end="01:32:15.700" style="s2">seed falling to the cracks of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.850" end="01:32:18.460" style="s2">sidewalk and the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.700" end="01:32:21.010" style="s2">death works and life works what would it</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.460" end="01:32:22.660" style="s2">mean to play game be became in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.010" end="01:32:25.240" style="s2">this notion of what would it mean to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.660" end="01:32:28.240" style="s2">able to create life what would it mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.240" end="01:32:30.100" style="s2">to to be able to create a seed a truly</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.240" end="01:32:34.350" style="s2">viable seed that would actually grow</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.100" end="01:32:37.630" style="s2">even in the context of the sidewalk and</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.350" end="01:32:39.340" style="s2">reflecting on the degree to which almost</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.630" end="01:32:42.400" style="s2">all of our efforts as humanity hitherto</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.340" end="01:32:45.400" style="s2">have in fact been death works what would</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.400" end="01:32:48.940" style="s2">it mean for us to practice life works so</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.400" end="01:32:52.120" style="s2">I will take that with me if anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.940" end="01:32:55.090" style="s2">has anything they say please now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.120" end="01:32:58.760" style="s2">the time when you buy bubble</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.090" end="01:33:03.920" style="s2">on that point the question I&#39;m leaving</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.760" end="01:33:06.920" style="s2">with is you know the Daymond when I rest</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.920" end="01:33:11.930" style="s2">into it is he&#39;s really creating art he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.920" end="01:33:13.790" style="s2">not trying to win a finite game so you</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.930" end="01:33:15.020" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know if I have a question</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.790" end="01:33:20.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just there&#39;s just a statement or</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.020" end="01:33:24.640" style="s2">insight but I&#39;m leaving with if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.210" end="01:33:24.640" style="s2">choosing I&#39;ll go with film</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.800" end="01:33:35.960" style="s2">there&#39;s interesting because I think the</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.240" end="01:33:44.710" style="s2">first thing that Jake said where we</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.960" end="01:33:49.940" style="s2">ended off that was expression and</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.710" end="01:33:51.140" style="s2">expressing what is true to yourself all</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.940" end="01:33:56.480" style="s2">the collection of interest that you have</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.140" end="01:33:59.290" style="s2">and showing that maybe as art and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.480" end="01:34:02.780" style="s2">think I&#39;m trying to think through like</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.290" end="01:34:09.710" style="s2">what is usually uniquely mine not to</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.780" end="01:34:15.080" style="s2">share as well I think Jake also as a</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.710" end="01:34:19.970" style="s2">second thing for me to think about being</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.080" end="01:34:22.400" style="s2">versus having and moving away from every</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.970" end="01:34:25.760" style="s2">single thing that I&#39;m doing has to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.400" end="01:34:30.110" style="s2">because of some reason to get something</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.760" end="01:34:33.260" style="s2">else and how can I switch them mindset</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.110" end="01:34:35.570" style="s2">so that I&#39;m not hoping to get something</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.260" end="01:34:45.400" style="s2">in the future based on things in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.570" end="01:34:45.400" style="s2">present I am going to pass with Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.210" end="01:34:56.720" style="s2">I&#39;m going to play volleyball and give a</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.500" end="01:35:00.650" style="s2">set shot down to that Jorge sure so the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.720" end="01:35:05.120" style="s2">one thing that I&#39;m leaving with well I</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.650" end="01:35:10.490" style="s2">have the idea of slots and things into</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.120" end="01:35:13.700" style="s2">slots trying to capitalize on my own</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.490" end="01:35:18.500" style="s2">free time and trying to reduce the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.700" end="01:35:23.540" style="s2">amount of things that I give slots to in</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.500" end="01:35:30.140" style="s2">order to to play this game be where I</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.540" end="01:35:33.020" style="s2">feel like the initial thought in in</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.140" end="01:35:36.200" style="s2">existing within game a is if we are</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.020" end="01:35:40.760" style="s2">living inside and you have to find a</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.200" end="01:35:41.930" style="s2">spot for B but I think I can take that</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.760" end="01:35:45.380" style="s2">idea in sir</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.930" end="01:35:48.470" style="s2">on myself the idea of game B and let</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.380" end="01:35:54.230" style="s2">little spots of game a float around in</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.470" end="01:35:56.660" style="s2">that space but just give that a small</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.230" end="01:36:00.140" style="s2">chance rate and engulf myself in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.660" end="01:36:03.760" style="s2">other time the question that I am</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.140" end="01:36:10.160" style="s2">leaving with is the notion of buffer and</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.760" end="01:36:12.590" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s throwing</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.160" end="01:36:19.340" style="s2">me around more is what is this buffer I</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.590" end="01:36:22.670" style="s2">saw it as trying to remove ideas from</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.340" end="01:36:24.740" style="s2">game a that might be messing with your</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.670" end="01:36:27.500" style="s2">you know reaching the top of the hill</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.740" end="01:36:28.730" style="s2">where the city of MB is I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.500" end="01:36:30.620" style="s2">what it is but that that&#39;s where of my</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.730" end="01:36:33.580" style="s2">question understand we pass it off to</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.620" end="01:36:33.580" style="s2">the other Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.660" end="01:36:41.140" style="s2">thank you right so I guess there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.220" end="01:36:42.730" style="s2">things I&#39;m sitting with right now one is</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.140" end="01:36:44.830" style="s2">and I think they&#39;re in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.730" end="01:36:52.420" style="s2">possibly they&#39;re actually the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.830" end="01:36:54.310" style="s2">but one of them is I feel much more like</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.420" end="01:36:56.350" style="s2">I feel like I&#39;m identifying much more</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.310" end="01:36:59.500" style="s2">with pursuits of a silica selfless</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.350" end="01:37:02.230" style="s2">selfless nature than I was when I came</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.500" end="01:37:06.640" style="s2">into this conversation which is really</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.230" end="01:37:08.800" style="s2">good and the second thing is that in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.640" end="01:37:09.870" style="s2">vein of what some people have been</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.800" end="01:37:15.600" style="s2">talking about sort of like Damon</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.870" end="01:37:19.830" style="s2">inspired things I&#39;m feeling much more a</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.600" end="01:37:22.900" style="s2">little bit ready to engage in things</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.830" end="01:37:24.610" style="s2">creatively with that sort of creative</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.900" end="01:37:26.650" style="s2">mindset and and sort of drawing on</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.610" end="01:37:30.910" style="s2">intuition which well we&#39;ll see how how</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.650" end="01:37:34.150" style="s2">far we get with that and if I have a</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.910" end="01:37:36.820" style="s2">question right now one of them is how do</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.150" end="01:37:38.380" style="s2">I keep that going and and which I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.820" end="01:37:40.300" style="s2">have to think about for myself and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.380" end="01:37:42.210" style="s2">the other would be I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.300" end="01:37:44.770" style="s2">concerned I would like to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.210" end="01:37:47.440" style="s2">completely having like a loss of self</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.770" end="01:37:51.760" style="s2">because I don&#39;t like complete non egoism</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.440" end="01:37:54.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not into that so and I will pass it</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.760" end="01:37:54.780" style="s2">off to Jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.900" end="01:37:59.830" style="s2">right as per usual I&#39;m not going to know</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.000" end="01:38:01.780" style="s2">all of the ways that this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.830" end="01:38:03.730" style="s2">has changed me and so long after the</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.780" end="01:38:06.850" style="s2">conversation that is the power of a</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.730" end="01:38:08.470" style="s2">conversation at least a good one um but</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.850" end="01:38:12.250" style="s2">the buffer is definitely something that</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.470" end="01:38:15.340" style="s2">is in sticking with me this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.250" end="01:38:16.840" style="s2">creating space in society and how we do</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.340" end="01:38:19.030" style="s2">that in our own lives by hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.840" end="01:38:21.910" style="s2">playing game be 90% of the time and game</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.030" end="01:38:26.770" style="s2">aid 10% or whatever our life allows but</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.910" end="01:38:29.440" style="s2">also on an individual sense of how many</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.770" end="01:38:31.630" style="s2">game B players does it take to buffer a</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.440" end="01:38:33.610" style="s2">game a player like how many of us is</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.630" end="01:38:35.710" style="s2">already tippity allow game a player and</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.610" end="01:38:37.540" style="s2">like walk them through how to like play</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.710" end="01:38:39.880" style="s2">a more cooperative game once we&#39;ve even</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.540" end="01:38:42.100" style="s2">figured it out but like buffer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.880" end="01:38:45.300" style="s2">sitting with the buffer and I will pass</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.100" end="01:38:45.300" style="s2">it off to Isaiah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.420" end="01:38:57.060" style="s2">I feel this was a wonderful beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.350" end="01:38:58.260" style="s2">conversation I mean I feel like sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.060" end="01:39:04.400" style="s2">like an afterglow I&#39;m gonna probably</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.260" end="01:39:07.230" style="s2">have a hard time going to sleep and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.400" end="01:39:12.750" style="s2">get any a specific question that comes</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.230" end="01:39:14.340" style="s2">to mind is how can how can I and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.750" end="01:39:19.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a personal question so how can I</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.340" end="01:39:20.790" style="s2">find people how can I find and help</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.080" end="01:39:23.940" style="s2">these help other people who might be</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.790" end="01:39:29.160" style="s2">trapped in a game a mindset shift it</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.940" end="01:39:32.010" style="s2">slightly and welcome down to game B and</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.160" end="01:39:34.160" style="s2">how do I I feel like that also engenders</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.010" end="01:39:35.760" style="s2">respond responsibility on me so how do I</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.160" end="01:39:39.900" style="s2">what is the nature of that</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.760" end="01:39:42.560" style="s2">responsibility for me and I will pass it</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.900" end="01:39:45.770" style="s2">to Mike</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.560" end="01:39:45.770" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.470" end="01:40:01.610" style="s2">I&#39;ll find myself feeling I just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.030" end="01:40:03.650" style="s2">struck with the beauty of some of these</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.610" end="01:40:05.450" style="s2">exchanges and I know in my end there</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.650" end="01:40:08.150" style="s2">then sort of sequences that have</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.450" end="01:40:09.739" style="s2">unfolded where you know a few people</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.150" end="01:40:11.330" style="s2">would say a few things and that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.739" end="01:40:13.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a catalyst for something and</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.330" end="01:40:14.600" style="s2">then I would say something and then that</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.370" end="01:40:16.010" style="s2">could serve as catalysts for other</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.600" end="01:40:18.440" style="s2">people and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.010" end="01:40:20.239" style="s2">brothers in this space so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.440" end="01:40:22.489" style="s2">quite beautiful that we&#39;re able to do</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.239" end="01:40:28.070" style="s2">that coming together you know most of us</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.489" end="01:40:31.010" style="s2">I imagine not having known each other so</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.070" end="01:40:38.840" style="s2">that reflection feels present to me and</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.010" end="01:40:41.989" style="s2">I have this the sense of this question</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.840" end="01:40:44.720" style="s2">that that&#39;s worth exploring</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.989" end="01:40:48.260" style="s2">it feels abstract but the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.720" end="01:40:52.820" style="s2">difference and between like pushing away</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.260" end="01:40:55.489" style="s2">from something versus digging it in</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.820" end="01:40:59.210" style="s2">myself if I&#39;m up against something that</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.489" end="01:41:02.960" style="s2">is that I see is worth changing and then</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.210" end="01:41:05.989" style="s2">I can scale that out pushing off of</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.960" end="01:41:08.390" style="s2">where I am versus digging in more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.989" end="01:41:11.120" style="s2">and what is the place of deeper embrace</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.390" end="01:41:12.980" style="s2">take me do I begin to see things that</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.120" end="01:41:15.070" style="s2">I&#39;m not able to see as I&#39;m pushing away</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.980" end="01:41:22.580" style="s2">from that monday-saturday</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.070" end="01:41:29.600" style="s2">yeah birth in motion so yeah I will pass</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.580" end="01:41:33.710" style="s2">it along to chat great yeah there was so</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.600" end="01:41:35.870" style="s2">much there it&#39;s hard for me to pick one</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.710" end="01:41:38.060" style="s2">thing but one thing did come up this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.870" end="01:41:40.600" style="s2">another the convergent streams I think</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.060" end="01:41:44.090" style="s2">that&#39;s bringing me here one of the last</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.600" end="01:41:48.110" style="s2">things that was reached researching was</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.090" end="01:41:50.960" style="s2">was a climate heart actually so the</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.110" end="01:41:53.810" style="s2">environmental arts and seeing it come up</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.960" end="01:41:57.510" style="s2">here again is very interesting so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.810" end="01:42:03.510" style="s2">making me rethink</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.510" end="01:42:05.370" style="s2">what I was doing in that project and</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.510" end="01:42:09.989" style="s2">what the project had to say and also how</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.370" end="01:42:12.210" style="s2">I was orienting myself in it and what it</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.989" end="01:42:16.340" style="s2">might tell me about the artistic process</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.210" end="01:42:16.340" style="s2">that&#39;s going on right here right now</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.060" end="01:42:25.880" style="s2">how about info</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.650" end="01:42:40.840" style="s2">I was really affected by one of Jubilees</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.130" end="01:42:43.670" style="s2">comments on love be because I find it</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.840" end="01:42:49.190" style="s2">it&#39;s also leading to my question I find</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.670" end="01:42:52.460" style="s2">out I sometimes look at people with a</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.190" end="01:42:54.380" style="s2">right interactive people with kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.460" end="01:42:55.780" style="s2">awareness that I may not be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.380" end="01:43:00.679" style="s2">anything for them</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.780" end="01:43:04.570" style="s2">that uh maybe they&#39;re they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.679" end="01:43:09.610" style="s2">beyond what whatever I&#39;m capable of but</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.570" end="01:43:09.610" style="s2">he he he</p>

<p begin="01:43:13.220" end="01:43:20.750" style="s2">what can I have how can I go about</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.120" end="01:43:25.930" style="s2">getting or helping people get what I can</p>

<p begin="01:43:25.930" end="01:43:33.080" style="s2">now instead of that&#39;s in my head now</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.360" end="01:43:35.000" style="s2">instead of abandoning someone sending</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.080" end="01:43:41.140" style="s2">them in a a more proper direction or</p>

<p begin="01:43:43.670" end="01:43:49.130" style="s2">yeah thanks that I think the thread</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.330" end="01:43:51.949" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s most alive in me right now</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.130" end="01:43:54.710" style="s2">it&#39;s just this question around ego and</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.949" end="01:43:57.050" style="s2">what the role of ego is and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.710" end="01:44:00.500" style="s2">and it occurred to me just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.050" end="01:44:04.130" style="s2">feeling my own sensations in this</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.500" end="01:44:07.219" style="s2">conversation and afterward that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.130" end="01:44:11.840" style="s2">a sense that from the kind of game a</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.219" end="01:44:13.460" style="s2">perspective the prospect of of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.840" end="01:44:16.340" style="s2">we&#39;re like giving up something of</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.460" end="01:44:18.980" style="s2">yourself is very aversive and it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.340" end="01:44:22.969" style="s2">the standpoint of kind of being a self</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.980" end="01:44:25.429" style="s2">trying to get things that idea seems</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.969" end="01:44:28.219" style="s2">like a threat but from the standpoint of</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.429" end="01:44:31.940" style="s2">being engaged in a process in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.219" end="01:44:35.210" style="s2">conversation like this one where my</p>

<p begin="01:44:35.210" end="01:44:39.920" style="s2">just part of the process that is this</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.980" end="01:44:42.949" style="s2">kind of ongoing conversation it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.920" end="01:44:45.260" style="s2">that my self is fully kind of effaced</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.949" end="01:44:47.420" style="s2">and and destroyed it&#39;s that the question</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.260" end="01:44:48.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even come up of you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.420" end="01:44:51.889" style="s2">the threat to me or what&#39;s the and what</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.860" end="01:44:54.889" style="s2">are the implications for me and just</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.889" end="01:44:57.350" style="s2">just having the experience of that kind</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.889" end="01:44:59.360" style="s2">of Orient&#39;s me and points me toward okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.350" end="01:45:01.940" style="s2">maybe this is what interactions would be</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.360" end="01:45:05.090" style="s2">like in a different kind of system and</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.940" end="01:45:07.429" style="s2">in a kind of game be world is is the</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.090" end="01:45:09.920" style="s2">question of you know what am I going to</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.429" end="01:45:11.239" style="s2">get out of this it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.920" end="01:45:12.350" style="s2">that you got nothing or you give up</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.239" end="01:45:15.619" style="s2">something it&#39;s that it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.350" end="01:45:19.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to come up that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.619" end="01:45:42.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m leaving with and I will pass it</p>

<p begin="01:45:46.730" end="01:45:52.480" style="s2">so together so that was just something</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.100" end="01:45:52.480" style="s2">is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.620" end="01:45:59.450" style="s2">trying to make sense of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.760" end="01:46:17.750" style="s2">right now I guess and I&#39;m leaving the</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.450" end="01:46:23.870" style="s2">idea that I guess I&#39;m taking away this</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.750" end="01:46:28.760" style="s2">idea that mmm I I shared with Jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.870" end="01:46:30.080" style="s2">who wanted to you know find the litmus</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.760" end="01:46:32.630" style="s2">test for what the differences between</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.080" end="01:46:35.060" style="s2">game Amb is and she also said that she</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.630" end="01:46:38.330" style="s2">is unsuccessful at game AI can really</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.060" end="01:46:39.890" style="s2">relate to that and I got a bit</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.330" end="01:46:44.680" style="s2">distracted during the call so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.890" end="01:46:48.890" style="s2">participate as much as I wanted to but I</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.680" end="01:46:52.340" style="s2">feel some solidarity with the group in</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.890" end="01:46:56.270" style="s2">that some progress has been made and you</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.340" end="01:46:58.400" style="s2">know I feel that that net positive I do</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.270" end="01:46:59.600" style="s2">want to leave the group with a point</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.400" end="01:47:01.580" style="s2">it&#39;s something that didn&#39;t come up at</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.600" end="01:47:04.400" style="s2">all in this conversation which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.580" end="01:47:06.650" style="s2">politics because the presidential</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.400" end="01:47:09.710" style="s2">debates are actually tonight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.650" end="01:47:12.800" style="s2">already started and in my view in my</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.710" end="01:47:17.450" style="s2">humble opinion there is one game B</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.800" end="01:47:19.160" style="s2">candidate up there just one so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.450" end="01:47:20.690" style="s2">going to tell you that is you can ask me</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.160" end="01:47:23.810" style="s2">if you want to know or form your own</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.690" end="01:47:25.580" style="s2">opinion but uh there&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.810" end="01:47:26.960" style="s2">personal quest and all this that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.580" end="01:47:30.410" style="s2">been talking about but there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.960" end="01:47:33.110" style="s2">sociological political context and how</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.410" end="01:47:35.480" style="s2">our decisions work for other people too</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.110" end="01:47:39.880" style="s2">so I think we need to give equal</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.480" end="01:47:43.420" style="s2">attention to that Thanks and a bit too</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.880" end="01:47:43.420" style="s2">who hasn&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.489" end="01:47:50.780" style="s2">have you gone go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.579" end="01:47:58.929" style="s2">hey thanks no that was great I think it</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.980" end="01:48:03.329" style="s2">really expanded on some of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.929" end="01:48:07.030" style="s2">discussions from last week at U of T</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.329" end="01:48:13.599" style="s2">kind of cornerstone discussions about</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.030" end="01:48:15.429" style="s2">what is game B and one of the well some</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.599" end="01:48:20.550" style="s2">of the themes that kind of thread it out</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.429" end="01:48:23.679" style="s2">there kind of show that game B really is</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.550" end="01:48:26.099" style="s2">humans are involved for game B already</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.679" end="01:48:31.650" style="s2">and I think that we&#39;re kind of cultured</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.099" end="01:48:35.710" style="s2">for game a and I think looking you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.650" end="01:48:37.659" style="s2">looking across the entire spectrum it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.710" end="01:48:42.849" style="s2">important to look at that we saw words</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.659" end="01:48:45.010" style="s2">like love the theme of community that</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.849" end="01:48:46.929" style="s2">you really have to to care moment to</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.010" end="01:48:48.369" style="s2">moment and live life with what matters</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.929" end="01:48:51.239" style="s2">like these are essential things for what</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.369" end="01:48:53.260" style="s2">is game B I think anther</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.239" end="01:48:57.360" style="s2">anthropologically when you when you look</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.260" end="01:49:00.610" style="s2">back at human beings and our</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.360" end="01:49:03.550" style="s2">predecessors you know a tribe would have</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.610" end="01:49:06.849" style="s2">gone through cycles of abundance and</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.550" end="01:49:08.909" style="s2">scarcity which are still themes that we</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.849" end="01:49:11.829" style="s2">live with today depending on how</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.909" end="01:49:14.110" style="s2">successful you are at game a at</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.829" end="01:49:16.000" style="s2">different points in your life and I</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.110" end="01:49:20.889" style="s2">think that you know we&#39;re already really</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.000" end="01:49:25.480" style="s2">primed very much so for for game B but</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.889" end="01:49:31.329" style="s2">maybe in the illusion of permanence of</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.480" end="01:49:37.389" style="s2">game a we kind of lose track and are</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.329" end="01:49:40.630" style="s2">almost exploited by what game a is to</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.389" end="01:49:44.940" style="s2">lose focus on our community so I think</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.630" end="01:49:44.940" style="s2">that&#39;s you know cornerstone stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.210" end="01:49:51.190" style="s2">looking to the bigger picture question I</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.250" end="01:49:53.619" style="s2">suppose that I have I&#39;m always in</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.190" end="01:49:54.820" style="s2">pursuit of answering and perhaps a you</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.619" end="01:49:58.719" style="s2">know in the nature of game B would</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.820" end="01:50:01.659" style="s2">always be in the pursuit of refining the</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.719" end="01:50:05.230" style="s2">solution to it is that the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.659" end="01:50:09.250" style="s2">obstacle to gain B itself is gay</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.230" end="01:50:11.260" style="s2">May and game a is you know employed well</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.250" end="01:50:14.950" style="s2">rather successfully over the last I</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.260" end="01:50:17.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know 70 years or century or</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.950" end="01:50:21.370" style="s2">perhaps five centuries by</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.040" end="01:50:24.280" style="s2">english-speaking Westerners Europeans</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.370" end="01:50:26.700" style="s2">but now it&#39;s played by everyone yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.280" end="01:50:31.030" style="s2">across you know game a is the great</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.700" end="01:50:34.570" style="s2">battle of civilization so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.030" end="01:50:39.100" style="s2">interested in seeing how technology is</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.570" end="01:50:42.400" style="s2">employed actively and passively to kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.100" end="01:50:46.930" style="s2">of progeny and reawaken the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.400" end="01:50:49.930" style="s2">behind game be and maybe see what</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.930" end="01:50:53.320" style="s2">technologies emerged to to accelerate</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.930" end="01:50:55.770" style="s2">game be and out-compete game a at what</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.320" end="01:50:58.810" style="s2">it is and kind of solve a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.770" end="01:51:03.239" style="s2">predicaments that that exponential game</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.810" end="01:51:08.380" style="s2">a has has has left us with to answer for</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.239" end="01:51:12.610" style="s2">so this talk was great I wasn&#39;t keeping</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.380" end="01:51:16.000" style="s2">track of who was going there is there</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.610" end="01:51:22.330" style="s2">anyone who hasn&#39;t spoken yet perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.000" end="01:51:24.720" style="s2">Daniel Zack or liked how you laid that</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.330" end="01:51:27.940" style="s2">all out in fact I found it very hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.720" end="01:51:30.370" style="s2">so I just wanted to comment on that I</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.940" end="01:51:34.480" style="s2">apologize for the CD lighting it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.370" end="01:51:37.540" style="s2">my digital sunset I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.480" end="01:51:39.730" style="s2">taking away from this is that at some</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.540" end="01:51:45.280" style="s2">point in this conversation I felt almost</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.730" end="01:51:48.370" style="s2">like a raisin heart rate and I I</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.280" end="01:51:49.600" style="s2">realized it had to do with this feeling</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.370" end="01:51:52.660" style="s2">which I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m qualified</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.600" end="01:51:54.640" style="s2">to say that anything in my life up to</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.660" end="01:51:58.330" style="s2">this point that has been that could be</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.640" end="01:52:00.700" style="s2">described as spiritual has been pointing</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.330" end="01:52:03.100" style="s2">roughly in similar directions like</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.700" end="01:52:05.050" style="s2">there&#39;s been themes towards my</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.100" end="01:52:07.480" style="s2">experiences you know growing up as a</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.050" end="01:52:09.340" style="s2">committed Christian and then losing that</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.480" end="01:52:11.620" style="s2">and then my experiences through</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.340" end="01:52:13.180" style="s2">meditation practices and through you</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.620" end="01:52:15.489" style="s2">know those really meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.180" end="01:52:17.500" style="s2">conversations with people till five in</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.489" end="01:52:18.920" style="s2">the morning or my experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.500" end="01:52:20.660" style="s2">psychedelics and the</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.920" end="01:52:23.449" style="s2">types of interactions it&#39;s like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.660" end="01:52:27.440" style="s2">pointing towards something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.449" end="01:52:30.679" style="s2">almost similar to its the idea that your</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.440" end="01:52:34.790" style="s2">your psyche always has a task for you</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.679" end="01:52:37.100" style="s2">and our relationship with that task is</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.790" end="01:52:39.890" style="s2">almost like a function of our level of</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.100" end="01:52:41.840" style="s2">courage our level of virtue and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.890" end="01:52:43.790" style="s2">that&#39;s the source of the raised heart</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.840" end="01:52:46.610" style="s2">rate like I feel and maybe this is my</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.790" end="01:52:50.179" style="s2">question that something is being</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.610" end="01:52:51.949" style="s2">requested of me that there&#39;s some sort</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.179" end="01:52:55.730" style="s2">of maybe the question could be</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.949" end="01:52:57.800" style="s2">formulated as what is it that I ought to</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.730" end="01:53:01.160" style="s2">sacrifice or what is it that I am not</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.800" end="01:53:02.150" style="s2">willing to let go of in service of game</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.160" end="01:53:04.100" style="s2">B or</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.150" end="01:53:07.550" style="s2">you know some other formulation of</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.100" end="01:53:11.449" style="s2">whatever is in that direction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.550" end="01:53:14.449" style="s2">it&#39;s very exciting but it&#39;s also it so</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.449" end="01:53:15.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit fear inducing and</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.449" end="01:53:17.360" style="s2">actually just one thing to make it like</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.890" end="01:53:19.640" style="s2">a little more concrete and personal and</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.360" end="01:53:23.390" style="s2">less abstract I think part of my fear</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.640" end="01:53:26.840" style="s2">here is that by being a game B player in</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.390" end="01:53:28.489" style="s2">a game a world I I think part of me is</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.840" end="01:53:31.790" style="s2">afraid that I will be taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.489" end="01:53:35.900" style="s2">and I&#39;m not entirely sure how to manage</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.790" end="01:53:39.170" style="s2">that other than what Jordan said one of</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.900" end="01:53:42.140" style="s2">the Jordans this concept of a leap of</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.170" end="01:53:50.600" style="s2">faith and so maybe that is something for</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.140" end="01:53:56.690" style="s2">me too to run with and I will I guess</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.600" end="01:54:00.650" style="s2">Melissa hi well I for one am totally</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.690" end="01:54:04.100" style="s2">unsatisfied I think we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.650" end="01:54:08.449" style="s2">scratching the surface and I think it</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.100" end="01:54:12.469" style="s2">speaks to the benefit and essential</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.449" end="01:54:14.390" style="s2">nature of building a shared context and</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.469" end="01:54:17.750" style="s2">continuing to have conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.390" end="01:54:21.670" style="s2">people that have a shared understanding</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.750" end="01:54:21.670" style="s2">of the words that we&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.120" end="01:54:27.090" style="s2">so here&#39;s two more of these for one</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.850" end="01:54:27.090" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.429" end="01:54:34.919" style="s2">I just wanted to say one thing about</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.149" end="01:54:40.459" style="s2">what Zachary said it was very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.919" end="01:54:40.459" style="s2">but I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.860" end="01:54:47.430" style="s2">idea that game a is the enemy of game B</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.340" end="01:54:49.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s the single the most the thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.430" end="01:54:53.190" style="s2">that most prevents it or whatever it was</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.260" end="01:54:55.290" style="s2">that you said that may be the case but</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.190" end="01:54:58.260" style="s2">it also may be that it&#39;s the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.290" end="01:55:02.550" style="s2">and game a is game B is the butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.260" end="01:55:07.590" style="s2">that it is only because of that that</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.550" end="01:55:13.010" style="s2">game B as possible and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.590" end="01:55:16.020" style="s2">that matters but it helps that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.010" end="01:55:18.590" style="s2">perspective helps me not to go around</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.020" end="01:55:18.590" style="s2">hating everything</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.200" end="01:55:26.770" style="s2">and so where I&#39;m left what question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.400" end="01:55:29.890" style="s2">left with is the question that I always</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.770" end="01:55:33.100" style="s2">seem to be asking which is what is what</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.890" end="01:55:35.820" style="s2">does life want from me and what is what</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.100" end="01:55:37.880" style="s2">is game be calling me forth to be and do</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.820" end="01:55:41.020" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.880" end="01:55:41.020" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.260" end="01:55:51.830" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna keep asking now</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.800" end="01:55:57.920" style="s2">so thanks is everyone had a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.830" end="01:56:02.050" style="s2">speak I think I think I may be the last</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.920" end="01:56:02.050" style="s2">one all right Tim take a sound</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.449" end="01:56:20.230" style="s2">well like</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.860" end="01:56:31.470" style="s2">on taking us home we couldn&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.910" end="01:56:31.470" style="s2">unless we knew what it was</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.330" end="01:56:48.660" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.830" end="01:56:54.180" style="s2">what keeps coming things keep coming</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.660" end="01:56:59.520" style="s2">back to me something actually Jordan you</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.180" end="01:57:01.110" style="s2">said to me when I asked you if I asked</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.520" end="01:57:02.910" style="s2">you what your priorities were or what</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.110" end="01:57:07.620" style="s2">you were looking to achieve or something</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.910" end="01:57:10.470" style="s2">like that and you said to to develop or</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.620" end="01:57:14.780" style="s2">maintain or pursue a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.470" end="01:57:14.780" style="s2">continuity and</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.820" end="01:57:22.640" style="s2">this is a very powerful notion that</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.600" end="01:57:26.600" style="s2">relationship the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.640" end="01:57:28.220" style="s2">continuity and symmetry and for those</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.600" end="01:57:30.230" style="s2">who might be interested by that I</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.220" end="01:57:32.030" style="s2">recommend listening to daniel</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.230" end="01:57:36.080" style="s2">trachtenberg go talk to Forrest Landry</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.030" end="01:57:45.010" style="s2">on the Naraka podcast but</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.080" end="01:57:45.010" style="s2">what&#39;s so important about it is that</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.100" end="01:58:02.100" style="s2">there is a I am i leaving with a</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.570" end="01:58:09.680" style="s2">question I think I think though I think</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.100" end="01:58:13.650" style="s2">what is that which enables me to</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.680" end="01:58:17.040" style="s2">continue to keep going at all is in some</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.650" end="01:58:22.560" style="s2">sense that not in some is a deep knowing</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.040" end="01:58:27.090" style="s2">that at I am and we are it we are that</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.560" end="01:58:30.630" style="s2">which is continuous we have in our</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.090" end="01:58:35.430" style="s2">capacity to be in continuity we are we</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.630" end="01:58:38.210" style="s2">are it and so the notions of life works</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.430" end="01:58:42.660" style="s2">and death works these are inherently</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.210" end="01:58:48.060" style="s2">related and thus notion of seeding is</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.660" end="01:58:56.010" style="s2">inherently related you know we are that</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.060" end="01:58:57.080" style="s2">which dies and lives and so it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.010" end="01:59:00.870" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.080" end="01:59:06.030" style="s2">he&#39;s a and at that level the religious</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.870" end="01:59:08.020" style="s2">language of faith faith in that which</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.030" end="01:59:14.980" style="s2">cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.020" end="01:59:16.840" style="s2">circulated is just a trust in in the</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.980" end="01:59:21.400" style="s2">quality and the capacity for life itself</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.840" end="01:59:24.610" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to leave here and just keep</p>
