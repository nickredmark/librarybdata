<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something about um</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">especially especially when taking all</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">we could talk about together and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.879" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">condensing that into an hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">from a place where it&#39;s like oh yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">actually under curfew right now i mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna be here the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">basically just doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">but to condense and sort of pull through</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">um that right place</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">of well it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">well what is it when two minds</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">come together to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">do something of value this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">this seems to be core well i what i see</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">is i see my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">um playing with that do you wanna are we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">recording yeah we are good</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">um i see my daughter playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">toy that many kids have which has um</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">blocks of different shapes and holes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">different shapes</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">and of course the task is to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">how to fit the right block in the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">shaped hole</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">um and then i actually am now seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">even the specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">how do you call it development of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">capacitor development of skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">where she can pick up the box you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">look at it she can rotate it</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">grasp which one it is map it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">something in here that tells her what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">hole it goes into and then put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">hole like no experiments at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually i think a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">good metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got some number of blocks that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">um it&#39;s larger than four um and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">got some number of holes we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">and the the task is to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">rapidly can we take the complex space of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">possibility that is the union of our two</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">specific complex spaces of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">collapse it down to the moment that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">the highest</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">quality event that this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">movement calls for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s i think uh in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">conversation but also i would say in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">general like this is a very high</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">thing for us to be getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">better at doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">yeah absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">so when i messaged you i did say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">speaking about civilian could be a good</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">sure it&#39;s very ripe yeah um it provides</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">beautiful basis i think to begin to pull</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">in other things</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">and perhaps when ultimately lay the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">blocks down</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">in the correct order um i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">pretty much what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">in the knowledge that those blocks are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">to be replaced</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">appropriately as well so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">it seems like it would be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">to you know ask you to introduce the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">notion of sivium</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">to the kind of interested party that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">might not have heard you discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">before but it&#39;s distinctly aware that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">we need to build differently things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s the kind of person that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">likes to consider themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">well i&#39;m ready for change you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">i&#39;m willing to and actually i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">the means to participate in some form</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">um i&#39;m willing to put in the time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in coming into quality</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">interaction interesting to participate</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">in that please so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">the way i i think i maybe will begin is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">at the level of design um</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">perhaps even just a bit of a critique so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve endeavored we meaning humanity</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">have endeavored of course many times to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">reinvent the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">congregate with we live together um</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:37.759" style="s2">and in the past several centuries have</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">done so in ways that are endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.759" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">to do it in a way that is i would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">conscious or intentional right</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">thoughtful as opposed to merely</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">functional which is been the was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">order of the day for a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">and what i would say is different about</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">the notion of civilian</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">is that the the design intent came from</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">with a proposition that uh the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">is let me just begin by saying rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">um and it&#39;s maybe the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">civilization itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">so we&#39;re not just trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">how to create sort of a nice place to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">for example or even a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">ecologically sound</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">because there&#39;s a uh an awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">implications and complications of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">the total set of things that we do under</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">the heading of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">that need to be considered and that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">uh you know the the the effort or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">best intentions</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">um will tend to be unraveled or</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">uh will fail or sometimes even create</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">negative consequences</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">in a very micro case if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">actually think about the global case as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s maybe in the very beginning is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">there a way to put your arms around it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">where the the strength of your design is</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">of the the deeper problem which i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">just call the problem of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">another language i would call the</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">able able to address that set of</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">effectively and create something which</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">now it&#39;s really interesting that in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">past six months i&#39;ve been exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">work of one of your uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">somebody who lives near you i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">actually tyson yonkoporta</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">because he coming from a rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">different direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">ended up coming to some very similar</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">conclusions and i might be using some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">um so the first is the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">in many ways the problem of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">is also the problem of city</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">that it may in fact be appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">say that all civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">are merely the sort of actuation</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">adjunct of cities so whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">talking about roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">or you&#39;re talking about the british</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">empire or talking about the american</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">empire</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">um or i suppose you can go backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">talk about the city-states of greece</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">in each case the extended territory</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">as significant as it was may in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">properly seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">as being something like the circulatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">system um</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">of the city which was at the the essence</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">and in the network of cities by the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">and this is based from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">largely in the work of uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">jeffrey west and louis betancourt which</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">popularized in the book scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very very interesting notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">and the next question would be okay why</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">and more specifically what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">changes would be the adequate changes</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">to shift that and here again</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">uh tyson i think is the nail in the head</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">when he makes a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">between what he calls growth and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">so here the notion is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">again western betancourt they noticed</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">that cities have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">scaling characteristic which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">that as a city grows</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">certain metrics like say for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">wealth per capita</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">grow in a very unusual way generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">speaking in nature what we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">is that when an organism and that might</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">include say like an ecosystem like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">forest or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">a part of what we might consider an</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">organism like a cell as</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">as the as the organism grows uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">most of the relevant characteristics um</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">grow on what&#39;s called a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">sublinear scaling so what this means is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">for example if i take a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">a mouse and i look at the the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">per unit mass meaning how much energy is</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">cycling through the organism</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">uh for the total mass in grams</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">if i increase the mass the actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">metabolism only increases</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">at about 85 percent so if i double the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">mass</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">instead of the metabolism doubling it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">only increases by 85 percent</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">which is to say that there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">built in and also certain limitations to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">scale built in to biological organisms</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">and this is common across all living</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">organisms and in fact in common across</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">human organisms as well like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">corporations have a similar scaling</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">factor if i double the number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">employees in a company</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">i actually don&#39;t double the uh revenue</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">per employee i actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">tend to it tends to increase i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">decrease per employee</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">but cities behave differently</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">bettencourt and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">west discovered that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">increased super linear which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">if i double the size of the city</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">and by the way in some sense hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">everything else constant</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">i will actually get a uh 115</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">increase of the wealth per capita</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">or income per capita if you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">now that&#39;s actually a super super</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">powerful discovery</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">um and one of the characteristics so now</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of going off on my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">um uh what&#39;s that called i&#39;m walking my</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">own plank now</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">so what what i would propose is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">creates that makes the city a certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">kind of a growth attractor</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">what the city has been trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">throughout history since we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">the construct of the city has been to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">to put as many people as possible in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">city as it can get</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">um and sort of every problem context</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">of cities and therefore every problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">context of civilizations that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">has to do with the constraints on that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">so for example if i put uh say a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">people in a city</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">i have to feed a million people and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">the only way that i can feed people is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">hauling uh wheat in on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">shoulders and bags</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">i can&#39;t pull that off very easily that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">hard to do more or less impossible</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">so i have to do things like invent roads</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">or invent barges</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a ratio a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">between on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">the physical constraints that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">associated with squeezing human bodies</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">physical space in terms of largely</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">energy coming in and waste going out</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">but also what they need to do other</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">things like meet other people and move</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">around in the space transportation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">the technological capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">um and then the the limitations to scale</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">that are are possible right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">effectively every city is is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">and what again what western bettencourt</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">found was that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">a moment where the city would tend to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">up to the limits of the existing</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">technology but remember because</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">as cities grow the actual certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">increase super linearly well one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">those in those characteristics is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">actually innovation</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">so as the cities would grow in uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">the innovation of that particular city</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">and therefore that civilization would</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">actually tend to also go</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">super linearly so you&#39;d get these</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">explosions of innovation which would</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">tend to cluster around constraints to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">and so you would tend to get these step</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">functions where they&#39;d actually pulse</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">and then of course you&#39;d get things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">were much much larger</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">than had previously existed in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">around them you know like the the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">cities you know er and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">and a cod and places like that until</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">eventually they do peter out</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">and something happens which limits their</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">capacity to grow whoops i lost you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">okay yeah keep going i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">so this this this um</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">this sort of mammon desire to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">to grow at all costs and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">kind of the imperial organization of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">and to some extent all time as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">subsidiary function to feed the growth</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">of the city</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">is a really interesting way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">about what&#39;s the problem of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">you know everything ultimately becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">feed stock</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">every small town exists largely as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">consequence of its context</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">in the relationship to the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">it to serve as a way of feeding the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">growth of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">of the city all the way up the chain to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">the largest cities and ultimately i</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">guess megalopolises and conservations</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">are now dominate our landscape okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">so then and then what tyson does is he</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">he presents an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">and and he specifically presents an</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">alternative that was real</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">in the context of the uh indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">uh human groups which he calls</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">increase and i i love his metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">actually he says okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">if i want to increase or or</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">improve let&#39;s just go with a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">metric iq</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">in a human broadly speaking there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">things i might do</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">i could grow the number of neurons i</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">could just make it a larger brain it</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">could take a brain that weighs</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">10 kilograms indicator brain that weighs</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">15 kilograms</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">or i could increase the quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">of the brain i could increase the not</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">just the number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">of neural connections uh the synapses</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">inside but also the quality which ones</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">specifically are networking with which</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">ones right the network</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">topology um and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">what i love about that metaphor is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">it&#39;s real right human beings actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">ran into a limit</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">on how rapidly or how big we could get</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">our brains because of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">the birth canal and so we ran into that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">limit</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">we were evolution was forced to find a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">way to continue to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">our cognitive capacities by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">increase meaning uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">if you think about development these</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">processes of development the brain will</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">actually create a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">then prune the hell of them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">know increase again all focusing on not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">more neurons but on better connections</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">okay well that&#39;s nice that that&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">right so the move is to say okay we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">to find a way to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">growth as a mandate and move towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">increases of mandate</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s one key premise of sibium</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">right first creep premise is we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">find a way to move away from the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">and all the characteristics that make</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">the city the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">uh and the second is all right one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">those characteristics is this uh notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">of growth and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">the thing that is the right thing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">increase quality quality of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">specifically and you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">that quite practically</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">and if i&#39;m moving into a city from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">small town</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">and moving into a city of say a million</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">people how big is melbourne</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">i think about three million ish give or</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">take a million</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">so i&#39;m moving from a town of about a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">hundred a small city of 150</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">000 and i moved to melbourne part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">point part of the attraction</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">is there&#39;s just a much larger potential</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">of relationships there&#39;s the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">that i will be able to find people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">um high quality relationships for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">they have similar tastes or</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">interests or whatever is just a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">by this case two orders of magnitude um</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">okay that&#39;s true but it also has real</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">problem which is well there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.519" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">million people and the reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">is you&#39;re only ever going to meet a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">small fraction of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">and only ever going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">relationship with an even smaller</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">fraction</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">so beyond a certain small number which</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">is around 150 000 people or so</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">um the bigger problem is actually search</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">math right you don&#39;t actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">think about like the internet</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">the internet is vast i don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">have a bigger internet what i need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">have is a better way of finding the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">the aspects of the internet that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">relevant to me and by the way now</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">so that&#39;s another piece right we start</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">thinking about increase or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">about quality</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">we start thinking about oh okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">move is to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">how do i move away from just adding more</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">nodes to the graph</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">and move towards getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">better and better at finding</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">the right relationships okay when i look</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">at the right relationships it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s three primary characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">one is who</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s the easiest like right now who</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">should i be talking to you right now or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">should i be talking to someone else</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">the second is what right as we began the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s a very large number</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">of possible things that we could</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">have in our relationship and being able</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">to orient on that what quickly</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">and well is a is a thing and then in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">some sense how</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">and how largely has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">on both of our parts to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">relationship how</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">deeply fully uh how intimately um</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">how sustainably how resiliently how</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">anti-fragile can we actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">um in some sense that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">all right so then let me make another</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s probably well i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">stop for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna break that promise i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">things are pouring in from the back of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">my head right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">so the next move is is an insight that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">had recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s right so i&#39;ll put it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">out there i&#39;ve already put it in a video</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">but i&#39;ll put it here as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">one of the things that has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">constraining the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">of cyvium up until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">is the the obligate</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">binding of the virtual with the physical</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">so when i look at that that super linear</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">scaling</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">and i look at it very closely this</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">notion of trying to squeeze as many</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">bodies into the same space as possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">what i notice is that the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">looking to be connected is not bodies</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s minds the real thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">actually driving</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">growth is minds more minds metcap&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s communication is the governing</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">protocol and the reason why cities are</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">cities is because up until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">the only way we could communicate was to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">be in person</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">um and even still relatively until like</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">i guess we had copied</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">the bandwidth of communication right</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">interpersonal and body communication</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">still dwarfed</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">radically dwarfed the bandwidth of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">telecommunication but take the clock</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">back 250 years and it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">obvious that if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">communicate with other people you had to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">in the same room more or less</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">so if communication between minds is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">thing that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">increase necessary wants to grow to all</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">right it wants to be everyone at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">in potential</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">um okay i get it and so the city has</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">been kind of like dragging bodies along</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">trying to get minds into connection and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">having to deal with the fact these minds</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">are connected to bodies</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">but nowadays this is no longer i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">a primary constraint as we see in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">call you and i are not in the same room</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">and yet we&#39;re having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">we&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s not bad right it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">the same as being in the same room but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">and i suspect on the one hand we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">getting better at it because we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">forced to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">by curfew and whatnot and on the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">hand i think we can continue to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">better at it with things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">photorealistic immersive vr for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">creating possibilities of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">simulation of embodied experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to put a flag there by the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">because that of course can be a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">but we&#39;re now walking the razor&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">between terrible things and awesome</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">things i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">us to step forward without having</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">both sides of the razor&#39;s edge in every</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">so what we can do now is we can decouple</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">the virtual from the physical and we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">render into the virtual what is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">virtual</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">and now of course be liberated to render</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">into the physical what is physical</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">and rediscover in the physical what</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">tyson&#39;s been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">the the more natural humane human scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">ways of life that are in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">having really high quality face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">interactions at the dunbar level</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">with other human beings frankly who we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">may spend large amounts of time with</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">real deep woven communities</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">and by the way with nature really</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">descaling the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">these massively densified locations that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">separate us from nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">and finding ways to live lightly with</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">nature and i&#39;m going to flag that as</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">well this is non-trivial well in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">want we can double click on it because</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting point of contention</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">to be frank</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">but then you&#39;ve got a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">new combo right a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a virtual and the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">civilian is is everything right so think</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">of it as the thing beyond facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">hopefully radically better i</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">designed from the very beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">actually be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">but where everyone all minds at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">all those who choose to be there</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">can be so it truly is a global community</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">of minds</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s it once you&#39;ve hit that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">is no more to go all minds at least in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">have the possibility of being in</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">the flip side of the civilian is a a</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">humane human scale way and i think i</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">would sort of add a third piece to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">my experience and i think there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">reason to believe this is a general</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">experience is that the</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">of an hour</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">in person particularly a conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">an hour in person say in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">right surrounded by nature um has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">cost for me i&#39;m introverted uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">extroverts enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t i um</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">yeah i hear you i mean i definitely hear</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">you on the increased cost</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">i think it has a lot to do with audience</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">and the the digital is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">um but i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had experiences</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">as well of speaking on stage perhaps or</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">speaking to a crowd where</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say your voice wasn&#39;t that well</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">received as being something which was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">quite taxing as well you know at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.919" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">i agree with you and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">there&#39;s like three elements to oh that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">that conversation or sorry that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">um to be frank makes me move to a tool</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">kit that describes things like fields of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">yeah um and i&#39;ve had experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">i actually feel the energy of the group</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">increasing my energy on stage but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">when i get off stage i feel like i got</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">unplugged from a light socket and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">wrung out</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve had experiences where it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">kind of a fight</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s been uh and that also is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">quite draining</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve had a few experiences but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:42.039" style="s2">quite rare where what you might say</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">the i sort of the spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.039" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">psychological psychosocial practices of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">the group</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">are actually highly nutritive and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">walk away from the conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">group actually feeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">refreshed yeah um this is harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">in the digital but that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">so what i would point to is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">new shamanic practices new psycho</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">um that bring into the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">virtual</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">with some thoughtfulness so that we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">not depleted or not unduly depleted</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">by our interactions in the virtual and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">also can take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">the way that we can recharge ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">so much more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">when the physical is really designed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">be nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">uh yeah yeah i hear you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">okay okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s one big run</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">there&#39;s another big run that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">if you&#39;d like that speaks more to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">if you just deserve it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">angle but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a good bite for now i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">yeah well i mean i certainly would like</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">you know i am also conscious of time um</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">so let me see if i can provide a couple</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">things back here</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">um because man there&#39;s a few different</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">roads to go on here</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">a few different tributaries</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">so you know i&#39;m hearing a lot and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">i&#39;m here what i&#39;m hearing is really good</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">you know i think i&#39;m i think i&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">if i can put things into slightly</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">different language</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">seems like and it&#39;s going to be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">abs like quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">abstract to begin with but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a value to be found in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">gathering around or near the center</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">right that the center matters to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">periphery if we take like the heart</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">blood moving all around the body it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">got to come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">i hear you when it comes uh you know an</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">analysis of city as</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">being historically at least this</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">movement of bringing minds together in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">as enabling increased wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">innovation</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">by this percentage increase coming of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">course at the expense of just broadly</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">the infrastructure that enables</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">whatever is around the center to in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">be nourished by what is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">you know um so good</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">i mean i did have a chat with a friend a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">little while ago his name&#39;s kieran</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">and he spoke to me about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">his understanding of why cities came</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">into being as they did had to do with um</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">protecting in physical space space a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">store of value</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">right the store of banks fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">now i don&#39;t think that needs um</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">challenge the notion of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">i think we can see it as complementary</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">right if we&#39;re protecting something of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">value around the center whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">thing is there needs to be a quite a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">precise</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">um formation of relationality enabling</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">of at least enough stability</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">for the center to hold around that store</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">of value whatever it is or that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">conception or sense of value well we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">we can specifically point to the notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">of stock or the notion of store of value</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">um there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">perturbation at the origin point of city</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">that one of the pieces is the separation</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">of of the human in complex flows</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">in cycles into something that begins the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">process of extraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">and extraction is the movement that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:05.919" style="s2">comes before store</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">i mean you can&#39;t store anything of value</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">until you&#39;ve first extracted that value</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">and so it&#39;s um you know there&#39;s a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a separation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">extraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">there&#39;s store then of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">context of store there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">different things that happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">including protect yep yep</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">yep and um well it seems like unless</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">breathing that value back and forth such</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">that it is not extraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">but a right reciprocal relationship we</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">that seems to be how it goes um although</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">we kind of fool ourselves because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">don&#39;t live very long and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">takes a while to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">that&#39;s right it can look real good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">the short term</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">planning for the short term if the short</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">term is several hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">unfortunately can be quite seductive to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">humans yeah it feels like the long term</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">and i think in this most profane age</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">that might be a trade that people can</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">trade and you can just look at the thing</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">hand and choose the thing in the right</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">and i would actually by the way say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">that weaves into the second</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">line of uh of the civilian story</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">that trade that shift um</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">which is to say uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">what i just said we can actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">it and think about it and get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">at the level of things like cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">science what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">with some precision uh and then say okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">okay that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">my heart and my mind can both say yes to</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">i like that expression just in my own</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">kind of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">a lower resolution way in but you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">well maybe maybe like this might take us</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">a while to get back to the completion of</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">and we&#39;re speaking about a right</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">speaking to these notions a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">more um</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem to me there can be minds</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">all like what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">we&#39;re caring and moving with right what</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">is the flow that we can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">is not exactly just a flow of mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s a flow of something else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">a flow of something</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">that is constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">webbing knitting together is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">being together of yeah nice</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">i think it&#39;s quite beautiful i like it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">lot it&#39;ll take me i think a while to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">metabolize it completely but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">i mean in some sense the premise of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is hey look</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">this thing that we&#39;ve been calling</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">communication and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">communications channel and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">body are kind of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">so if i am speaking to you in person</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">across a range of four or five seven</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:59.599" style="s2">feet um i happen to be using air</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">as the medium but my body is connecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.599" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">to your body</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a touch there has to be there</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">has to be actual contact</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">and if i&#39;m speaking to you across i</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">guess this is probably about 3 000 miles</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">um pulling light into a camera throwing</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">the camera into a computer throwing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">computer up into a satellite zipping it</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">about and coming</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">back down i&#39;m still touching you the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">difference between the two is in some</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">sense non-existent</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">our bodies are in relationship directly</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">as as good as dancing</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s powerful i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">right actually that&#39;s very well put</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">um and this speaks to i think the hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know that it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">me a while to integrate that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">well i think it means speaks in part to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">um the gradualness of this process</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">of um coming into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">the whos with who</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll say some more things about that but</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">feeling what the right touch</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">is in this new channel in this new</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">medium it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">thing i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">how much of our interaction is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">here by the voice and listening how much</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">is mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been able to learn about body</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">language that you can see given this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">percentage of my body right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">certainly some</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">um so how much are we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">bootstrapping on</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned in traditional</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">physical space that we&#39;re porting over</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">here versus what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">possible in terms of efficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">and integrity and integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">communication precisely within this</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">channel itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">i mean these are also things in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:55.599" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">um and it&#39;s experiments with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">of thing like i thought about perhaps um</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">not for this conversation in particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">because it&#39;d be almost too radical be</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">almost too radical</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">for me to be sitting down in that couch</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">with like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">the camera presented a certain way just</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">you know cross-legged like</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">really relaxed back like i would be if</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">we were talking here you know i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">like hey jordan do you want to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">right and i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">i&#39;d be lounging a bit but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">lounging here i&#39;m i&#39;m forward right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">that&#39;s respectful</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">you know i was talking with my with with</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">tassie my girlfriend about this you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s respectful i mean i&#39;m here i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">ready</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re doing something here i want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">create something beautiful with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">and i respect you and so here i am and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">this is taxing because i&#39;m in my living</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">room and i usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">lounge over there that&#39;s a lounge right</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">so many so many of these signals um</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">and um so maybe we could port this</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">over to um something that i do i do</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">think about quite a bit and i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">when it comes to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">what is it appropriate to record i.e</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">kind of like when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">speak about such things as sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">the very thing which we should be most</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">careful about</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">boxing up and pointing to and saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">that is the thing right there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">forgetting ourselves always in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">relationship with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">as the kind of constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">generators of it along with everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">else in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">right um we</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">we come up we come upon something and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">oh we want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s water it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">water through a net and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">so recording something is is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">be careful about it but then</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">okay i want to link this to something</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">else um</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s the notion of hierarchy um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">the notion of hetaraki and also one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">sort of um characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">game b um</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">so game b as i&#39;ve heard you described</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">with jim</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">on a few occasions is characterized or</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">aims at a kind of meta stability</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">broadly speaking to my understanding a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">kind of endurance</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">and a kind of anti-fragility or at least</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">and change enabling of continuity of</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">development um</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.230" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">network centric or network oriented</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">network centric is that what you say is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">characterizations that was an older</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.760" style="s2">formulation but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">right okay okay um and another one is um</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.760" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">non-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">am i right with that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">so so this is kind of interesting just</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:54.839" style="s2">to add to that it&#39;s it&#39;s not um how do i</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">say it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.839" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">ideologically extinguish the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">hierarchy but rather um specifically</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">about shifting the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">to be of service there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">this like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">basically the unseating of something and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">moving into his proper</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">location relationship in many cases the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">primary problems we&#39;re dealing with in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">game a is you know the tools becoming</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">the masters</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">or addiction we&#39;ve become dependent upon</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">our tools and have forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">in many ways that they were tools in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">first place and have taken them as</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">as obligate um so an unseating of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">repositioning things into right</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">relationship is a big part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">good okay yeah good i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">resonates very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">perhaps not the clearest it&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">not the clearest to say non-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">at least in terms of how it hits me</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">people think it is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">anarchic or flat right yeah non the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">non negates hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">um so to complete so to complete then</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m seeing at least the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">the right way to hold a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">i&#39;d love some feedback on this i will</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">try to see it more clearly is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">something like more of a wave where you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">have natural peaks</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">that give way to something</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">more flat um and then to re reestablish</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">um and that the the peaks hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">peaks would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">um like it&#39;s again staying in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">metaphor space but i kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">or one way to think about them this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">not the only way</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">certainly certainly not but it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">of ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">where wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">learning is actually conferred</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">so that all reach</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">that point um and so when and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">i started off by talking about recording</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think i would be so um</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">so mix and match here if we had a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">longer to speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about um</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">artifacts and ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something about events and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">which seems deeply</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.400" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">important um</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">this relationship between process and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">event alexander bartow is speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">this relationship between process</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">and event been obviously very interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">in process</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">um and we&#39;re always engaging in events</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a feeling of a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">an orchestration a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">as a summoning you&#39;ve spoken about mesh</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">how is it that the waves then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">sudden peak like what are we gathering</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.520" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">bringing back in this notion of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">center like what are we gathering around</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">good yeah the notion of censor i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">is exactly the place to go um oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s just maybe invoke the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">notion of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">and the notion of center um</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if values and purposes come</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">in but</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">a proper center</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">and by prop what i mean is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a a distinct and high integrity</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">shared sense of the what and the why</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">in the context of some given event</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">very concrete uh the the church is on</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">in our our town village okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">our collective intention there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">be no uh top-down</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">pushing and there&#39;s no formal structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">our collective heads pivot in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:23.440" style="s2">direction our collective heart rates</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">increase our collective eyes</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.440" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">dilate and then we begin the process</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">in a space of coherence meaning each and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">every</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">are simultaneously oriented towards the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">same center</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">something must be done so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">delicious in right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear exactly what but what</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">must be done the how</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">is quite unknown but the the what and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">the yr</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">we need to put out the fire we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">save the church and the y is unspoken</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a value right the values</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">are held in uh in common there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">orientation a common basis of values</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">um so then we begin to shift from values</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">to purposes</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">in the context of purposes there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s as simple as that there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">a natural i used to talk about with</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">schmacktenberger as a natural hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">and there are there are some who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">properly the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">capable of organizing people into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">right kind of structure to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">address the problem at hand</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">um it&#39;s unwise to put the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">two-year-olds in charge of of of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">managing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.960" style="s2">the bucket brigade it is wise to put the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">ones who are stronger</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.960" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">to carry the heavier water i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">not complicated if you sort of just deal</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">though if you were calling it the bucket</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">brigade i think you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">that might be the toddler version to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">honest the church is burning let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">the bucket brigade</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">not a lot of water is going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">to the fire i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">having a two-year-old and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">buckets and lots of spilled water</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s the key right once</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">you have a proper center</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">uh once there&#39;s been something where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">values have oriented a a group of</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">into it is in fact a coherent whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">a what is now a shared purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">then the right structure is just part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">reality and the mighty structure might</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">be anything it&#39;s hard to know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">and part of the real skillfulness is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">orient ourselves into that right</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">but oftentimes it will have a division</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">of labor and that division of labor</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">often will have</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">different people taking different</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">responsibilities and in many cases there</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">will be a hierarchy because certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">people will either be more skilled</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">naturally or more skilled experientially</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">and therefore it is appropriate for them</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">to have more responsibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">context of the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">purpose that is part of the shared</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">the shared group one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">that i think we run into in our current</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">context is that we don&#39;t have coherent</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">you know so we take what are effectively</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">random strangers with quite distinct</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">um and no shared purpose and we force</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">to do stuff together we force them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">coordinate and we create these weird</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">truncating governance things like</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">like democracy where we it&#39;s kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">is very much taking that peg</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">it is nothing more or less than forcing</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">round pegs into square</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">holes and it&#39;s because of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">the means and modalities of cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">have required the forcing together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">the admixture</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">of people into spaces that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">or the space to find their coherence</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">and therefore has required that we build</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">tools of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">coordination tools of forcing random</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">groups of people into being at least</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">somewhat effective</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">and then imposing what then becomes</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">formal hierarchy on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">effective randomness</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">and therein lies the problem right so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">might say that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">distinction in the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">city and sivium is uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">this notion of proceeding from coherent</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">holes</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">on the basis of some sort of shared</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">values that then have</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">a a proper center</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">as a whole and then from that place the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">their their movement into</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">how is um</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">more problem of competence than it is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">problem of of of process</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">formal process the process is organic</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">um there&#39;s that now you write up the</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">other one</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">how did it work well what i was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">there was i was seeing my friend zach</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">stein</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">and his emphasis on teacherly authority</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">or on education</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">make fun of him he could notice that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to know that if he&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">in a group where he&#39;s going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">the word education will definitely come</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">up um but</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">this is because it&#39;s a mess now and also</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">is universally applicable</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">at all times every relationship always</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">a educational content right that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">we do things we&#39;re not just doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">something we&#39;re also growing our</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">in every everything we do and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">creates a nice</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">i think um how do i say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">signpost or orientation on what this</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">sense of coherence and the sense of um</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">proper center maybe feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s a the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">relationship of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">process if looked at to the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">education which is from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">the same as the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">roughly the same as parenting</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">is you&#39;ll feel it and if you feel the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">of education is there and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">maximally there really is a sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">i am growing as much as i can in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">context of this encounter i&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">doing i am growing</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">um that actually is a really good way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">knowing whether or not you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">well um i&#39;d say we have about</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">a minute more yeah which is uh sad but i</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">guess it is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">yeah it is what it is um there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">more to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">yeah to be to be honest with you i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">i think that around about three hours</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">three and a half hours</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">possibly feels right for me to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">um get where it&#39;s possible to go</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">in a way that would be very meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">and i think deeply valuable there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s um there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">pacing</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">you know forrest speaks about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">question of when as being a question of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">the pacing of these interactions um</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">i i feel like in in some ways i</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">you know playfully i didn&#39;t violate</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">but i i jumped at grabbing a few things</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">the pot too too quickly and i could only</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">really do that with you in this context</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">because i know you can kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">all right yeah i was really throwing</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">paint at the wall in some respects</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">but you know we can more gently you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">make those brush strokes</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">why don&#39;t we just make a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">having two and a half more conversations</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">okay okay okay we can do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:26.960" style="s2">um although the half might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">challenging but this was good</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">i think um what we&#39;re gonna do so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">split it right down the middle so</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">instead of doing it this way we&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">yeah yeah good well i think you know i</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">think there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">you know in the first little bit there</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">um a nice introduction to civilian</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">and for those people who are listening</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">to this there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">you know breadcrumbs to follow for ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">be involved in conversation now um</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">you know i&#39;m facilitating with other</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">people through this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">mutual learning environments which nora</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">bateson speaks about but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">um you know the this isn&#39;t something</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">you have to uh put down and then be in</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">complete</p>
