<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:09.330" style="s2">solutionizing</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.779" end="00:00:14.389" style="s2">on history it&#39;s just Daniel and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.330" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">know where else is lost in the cloud</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.389" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">maybe they will be joining us</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:22.500" style="s2">so Daniel do you want to share currently</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">what you do for historical information</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.500" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">or what you see the world doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">I know we&#39;ve briefly talked about</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">tearing down and statues yeah sure you</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">know this is not my strongest area of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">expertise so you know I&#39;ll just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">talk off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">a little bit I think history is such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">huge broad subject I mean I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to sort of whittled down to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">well what am I am i interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.579" end="00:01:05.810" style="s2">history of what particular subject kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">of comes to mind and yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.810" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">statues coming down you know I saw some</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">conversations about how well that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">a racing history or something and I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:22.549" style="s2">I don&#39;t really see it that way at all I</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think like our actual history</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.549" end="00:01:30.110" style="s2">knowledge is based on whether there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">statue up in some Town Square somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.110" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">and I can only imagine you know if that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">particular image statue or would ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">had such a negative connotation why</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">would you want to walk past that or see</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">that on a regular basis you know just in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">regular everyday life when I go to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">museum you know then I&#39;m gonna see some</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">things on you know the history of war or</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">slavery or what-have-you but I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">like you know going to that would with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">particular open-mindedness and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">particular reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">and to see those things some sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:23.990" style="s2">know I don&#39;t feel like I have to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:23.990" style="s2">that everywhere I go every every minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">so yeah museums would be one place in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">Detroit there&#39;s the one that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">the DIA</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">Detroit Institute of Arts and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:43.380" style="s2">means the art museum but they have areas</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">with very old</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.380" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">you know Native American pottery and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">stuff collected from you know Roman</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">antiquity and and stuff and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:03:00.660" style="s2">is really cool to see it blows my mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">when I see some of these like artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">are something that were like made by</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:10.200" style="s2">someone 4,000 years ago and it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">makes it real and tangible so like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.200" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">think it is cool too and good to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">those artifacts you know well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:21.750" style="s2">there&#39;s fakes sometimes I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">they&#39;re rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.750" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">but kind of makes history come alive</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">when you can see artifacts in person I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">occasionally I can find a youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">channel with a professor that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">has a particular area of expertise and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:49.310" style="s2">that&#39;s cool I&#39;ve been very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">interested myself in religious studies</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.310" end="00:03:58.730" style="s2">and so that would be a like an area of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.459" end="00:03:58.730" style="s2">kind of focusing in on a particular area</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.300" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">and so finding a youtube channel with</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:11.850" style="s2">someone who like they&#39;ve totally</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">immersed their whole life in on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.850" end="00:04:16.830" style="s2">particular subject you know they seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">like a subject matter expert it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.830" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">helpful when it seems like the person is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:26.970" style="s2">kind of like a professional historian in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:29.700" style="s2">the sense that they don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.970" end="00:04:32.790" style="s2">have an agenda there like this is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.700" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">happens these are the facts I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.790" end="00:04:37.230" style="s2">trying to spin it one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">because I want to make it seem like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.230" end="00:04:41.220" style="s2">these people were better or worse or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">whatever just like this happened and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.220" end="00:04:54.090" style="s2">this happened and this happened I you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">know that comes to mind I I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.090" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">it&#39;s good to history hasn&#39;t been my</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">favorite subject but if you can if I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:09.570" style="s2">find the background on some subjects it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">has been enlightening for instance on</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.570" end="00:05:14.790" style="s2">things like evolution we we usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">think of Darwin as I&#39;ve gotten older and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.790" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">I found out like Darwin had his initial</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:25.110" style="s2">ideas and actually some of those things</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">have been updated and I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.110" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">science science is constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">challenge what has been theorized or</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">discovered and then you know turns out</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:45.350" style="s2">like we&#39;ve advanced since Darwin but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">ability to like read his original</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.350" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">writings and understand his original</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">ideas like helps you know that that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">been advanced to a certain degree I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:05.100" style="s2">don&#39;t know like I think it it comes down</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">to trust like who can I trust on my</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.100" end="00:06:12.950" style="s2">sources is it something like Wikipedia a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">good place to get history information</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.950" end="00:06:22.680" style="s2">you know I just posed that as a question</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:24.990" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know for sure yeah no thank</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">Kerry do you want to share what you do</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.419" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">currently for historical information or</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">what you see in the world happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">right now and thanks for joining</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">place and that M well basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.060" end="00:06:43.950" style="s2">historical information</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">mostly online stuff I said I have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:51.389" style="s2">tendency if I&#39;m searching for something</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:53.370" style="s2">I&#39;ll run through about 20-30 pages deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.389" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">wit I know people just click once and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.370" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">see a page what to get and then go from</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:07:00.270" style="s2">there but me I&#39;m just I&#39;m just very nosy</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">cuz what you&#39;re saying about Darwin I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:05.730" style="s2">found out that with to various sources</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:08.100" style="s2">there is ideas and that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.730" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">somebody elseís you know a so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.100" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">know what to trust you know there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:14.150" style="s2">much stuff that gets written by people</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:17.880" style="s2">but because they&#39;ve got the means of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.150" end="00:07:20.010" style="s2">being able to do dyes like you know give</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.880" end="00:07:21.690" style="s2">them the opportunity to do that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.010" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">the people with the ideas who may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.690" end="00:07:27.660" style="s2">poor or don&#39;t have all them connections</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">I&#39;m a tendency to their ideas are merged</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.660" end="00:07:32.700" style="s2">with somebody else&#39;s and it&#39;s put out to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:34.770" style="s2">be somebody else&#39;s enough but em as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.700" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">says I like to dig deep into things and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.770" end="00:07:39.660" style="s2">I just go and sometimes that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:40.979" style="s2">because like you find all sorts of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.660" end="00:07:43.590" style="s2">so at the end you don&#39;t know who to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.979" end="00:07:44.280" style="s2">believe in the end well in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.590" end="00:07:46.890" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">I&#39;d like it so you&#39;d actually be taught</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.890" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">in schools all the history because we</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:54.450" style="s2">would already taught certain things in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">school like we went to talk about slave</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.450" end="00:07:59.490" style="s2">trade to rent talked about anything like</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">that and when we did come to world war</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.490" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">two we would only told bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:07.320" style="s2">of the information that was in the books</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.490" end="00:08:09.750" style="s2">and that and then you find out later no</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.320" end="00:08:13.139" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the case you know it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.750" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">you with oh well who who is right as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.139" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">said it&#39;s just about to be in write</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">I would so the whole time I was watching</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">I was googling right did this actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:55.330" style="s2">happen is this true is this not true and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">so having something that that brought</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.330" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">both know that an event happened and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:05.230" style="s2">then be able to know what media is out</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:07.630" style="s2">there that has covered it and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.230" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">accurate that media is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.630" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">possibly like a pop-up ad afterwards it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:13.029" style="s2">can say ya know</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.540" end="00:10:22.570" style="s2">are clearly you know you might not even</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.020" end="00:10:25.209" style="s2">think about in the time the the dress</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.570" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">and I want history and this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.209" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">getting us the next part but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:32.230" style="s2">time so certain of what the next part</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:33.970" style="s2">the having history come alive for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.230" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">person who&#39;s interested being able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.970" end="00:10:38.230" style="s2">see how it weaves together I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:40.390" style="s2">able to track Darwin be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.230" end="00:10:42.130" style="s2">everyone he interacted with in his</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.390" end="00:10:44.580" style="s2">lifetime he was born on a day he died on</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.130" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">a day he had his his SS people that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.580" end="00:10:50.140" style="s2">took to the Galapagos that is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">well known but having that in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.140" end="00:10:54.279" style="s2">timeline of history so I could also see</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">what was happening with other figures</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.279" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">that were alive at the same time and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:58.810" style="s2">that interwove and how Wallace came up</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:00.490" style="s2">with the same idea at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.810" end="00:11:02.350" style="s2">I&#39;m not actually familiar with Darwin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.490" end="00:11:05.110" style="s2">stole it from someone else whether that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.350" end="00:11:08.230" style="s2">was Wallace or whether that was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.110" end="00:11:10.209" style="s2">somebody else but seen history come</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.230" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">alive organizing what&#39;s already there so</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.209" end="00:11:13.870" style="s2">that if I want to learn about slavery</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:15.550" style="s2">here because 12 years of slave is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.870" end="00:11:17.350" style="s2">definitely not the only one you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.550" end="00:11:19.300" style="s2">what to say okay well you know Gone with</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.350" end="00:11:21.490" style="s2">the Wind deals with slavery but is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.300" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">accurate depiction of slavery right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">actually grading the history on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:29.740" style="s2">historical context in retrospect right</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">in I when gone the width wind came out</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.740" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">I&#39;m sure they thought it was accurate</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:36.220" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t actually ask people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:38.500" style="s2">had um people had been alive at the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.220" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">but the descendants of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.500" end="00:11:43.930" style="s2">been alive at the time I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:46.779" style="s2">tons of artifacts in the world whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:48.550" style="s2">that be people&#39;s journals whether the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.779" end="00:11:49.899" style="s2">things that are actually in museums that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.550" end="00:11:51.940" style="s2">can be catalogued and we can all share</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.899" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">in it so if I can&#39;t get to the museum</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.940" end="00:11:56.740" style="s2">that has it I can still know everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:11:58.839" style="s2">that is encompassed in that museum we</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.740" end="00:12:01.390" style="s2">have an amazing Museum here called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.839" end="00:12:02.740" style="s2">Museum of Anthropology at UBC and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.230" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">I went there except nothing else to do I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:14.890" style="s2">was like why was I not here all day</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:17.459" style="s2">every day like the amount of First</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.890" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">Nations culture especially but also just</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.459" end="00:12:23.260" style="s2">all the different international people</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:25.269" style="s2">who have come to Canada and and some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:26.920" style="s2">their artifacts and their you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.269" end="00:12:29.079" style="s2">touch them but they&#39;re behind glass but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.920" end="00:12:32.290" style="s2">you can still get that somebody touched</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.079" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">this 200 years ago and so to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.290" end="00:12:36.519" style="s2">have what I would love to see is to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:39.399" style="s2">able to have a website like Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.519" end="00:12:41.380" style="s2">but that comes alive that I can track I</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.399" end="00:12:44.230" style="s2">can zoom in and out from pengie at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.380" end="00:12:45.990" style="s2">current in Thai and time right so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.230" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">the continents were all together out to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.990" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">currently and be able to track people</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:53.410" style="s2">places and things be able to see where</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:55.449" style="s2">inventions happen and where they spread</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.410" end="00:12:57.130" style="s2">to be able to see Darwin in his life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.449" end="00:12:59.199" style="s2">who he interacted with and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.130" end="00:13:01.029" style="s2">see the artifacts and to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.199" end="00:13:04.449" style="s2">current knowledge right this artifact</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.029" end="00:13:05.949" style="s2">might have been made 10,000 BC to 12,000</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.449" end="00:13:08.140" style="s2">BC that&#39;s not going to be an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.949" end="00:13:09.459" style="s2">date but it&#39;s accurate enough probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.140" end="00:13:12.279" style="s2">for that time period and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.459" end="00:13:14.890" style="s2">see how confident are we in this and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.279" end="00:13:17.230" style="s2">want the history from oh sure every way</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.890" end="00:13:18.490" style="s2">I want the history from everyone I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.230" end="00:13:20.050" style="s2">to know my actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.490" end="00:13:22.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t freaking care about King George</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.920" end="00:13:31.480" style="s2">actually go through what is the history</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.170" end="00:13:33.190" style="s2">of all of them I want access to all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:35.319" style="s2">the grandmothers interviews like I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.190" end="00:13:38.860" style="s2">to know the people who are alive today</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.319" end="00:13:40.420" style="s2">how they experienced the Vietnam War I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.860" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">love to people have all of that but that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.420" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">is not something we can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.899" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">I would love to hear what you guys would</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:52.329" style="s2">like to see her for history well in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:55.300" style="s2">future as I said like that dad started</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.329" end="00:13:58.990" style="s2">an idea one of the groups that involved</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.300" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">in after seeing somebody say you know we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.990" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">went we had this many people back then</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">but she was going back research in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">lives of ordinary people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">through ordinary people I think history</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.230" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">does come alive because what you&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">see is people of note you know I mean</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:17.170" style="s2">sink in but if you&#39;ve got somebody there</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:19.509" style="s2">talking about it you can listen and see</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.060" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">think I&#39;d like more people the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.339" end="00:15:32.030" style="s2">history rather than sort like using</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">politics at the time who said Wow</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.030" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">because it say like 3040 years from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:37.580" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.750" end="00:15:39.770" style="s2">a lot of people are just gonna be left</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.580" end="00:15:41.930" style="s2">with saucer-like influences on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.770" end="00:15:44.660" style="s2">to look back and say oh is this what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:49.100" style="s2">everybody was like you know I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.660" end="00:15:51.410" style="s2">you know the show that that is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.100" end="00:15:54.470" style="s2">yeah so I would like sup I was also like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.410" end="00:15:55.910" style="s2">choose for history as well and people</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.470" end="00:15:58.490" style="s2">going oh well you&#39;re a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.910" end="00:16:00.650" style="s2">theorist if you believe this when some</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.490" end="00:16:02.870" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve come true as you find</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.650" end="00:16:05.270" style="s2">out over time with that label still</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.870" end="00:16:07.310" style="s2">sticks but yeah so true true proper</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.270" end="00:16:09.500" style="s2">history does not just come from one</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.310" end="00:16:12.140" style="s2">textbook and not just won&#39;t come from</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.500" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">whoever&#39;s paying for that project at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:16.940" style="s2">time and what they their the agenda is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:18.860" style="s2">and that we&#39;re just just truthfulness I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.940" end="00:16:21.230" style="s2">think in history that&#39;s why I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.860" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">see going forwards and as I said if it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.230" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">adds a load of people doing the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.700" end="00:16:27.950" style="s2">history you know and research in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:29.900" style="s2">whatever interest they&#39;re into then as</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.950" end="00:16:32.690" style="s2">daniel said and you know it&#39;s somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.900" end="00:16:34.400" style="s2">research in it well into it you have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.690" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">tendency to believe they&#39;re more than</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.400" end="00:16:37.700" style="s2">what you have in some text book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">been put out with loads of advertising</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.700" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">sponsorship and everything else you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:44.900" style="s2">I mean so that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:50.180" style="s2">for the future Daniel you want to show</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.900" end="00:16:53.330" style="s2">your aversion yeah I I guess I can I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.180" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">kind of resonate with what Kerry said I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.330" end="00:16:57.500" style="s2">mean one of the things that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">mind on this is that old saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.500" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">winners write history and so we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:06.290" style="s2">these experts nowadays to go back be</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:08.840" style="s2">like well the win the winners wrote</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.290" end="00:17:13.850" style="s2">history but we may have found out some</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.840" end="00:17:15.230" style="s2">new information now and so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.850" end="00:17:17.570" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.230" end="00:17:19.880" style="s2">you know what comes to mind unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.570" end="00:17:25.100" style="s2">peoples history or mine see if almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.880" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">like a police investigation you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.100" end="00:17:28.670" style="s2">lot of times so you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:31.340" style="s2">interview a few different people and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.670" end="00:17:34.820" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have all their own version</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.340" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s through the grouping of all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.820" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">their perceptions that like the real</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:45.860" style="s2">truth comes out so I do know a community</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.860" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.860" end="00:17:50.660" style="s2">doing they and so technology is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.860" end="00:17:54.620" style="s2">help they what they were doing is they</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.660" end="00:17:58.309" style="s2">were doing recorded interviews with all</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.620" end="00:18:02.390" style="s2">their oldest members like their 80 up</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.309" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">and 90 90 year old members and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.390" end="00:18:07.400" style="s2">basically just said like a one-hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:09.290" style="s2">interview like of hey tell us the story</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.400" end="00:18:13.150" style="s2">of your life and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:18.679" style="s2">fascinating the details that people told</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">and so that type of you know recorded a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.679" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">lot of people aren&#39;t gonna write a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:26.090" style="s2">memoir but the idea that even if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think you&#39;re like this important</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.090" end="00:18:32.510" style="s2">person to do like a 1-hour recorded</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:33.890" style="s2">memoir of like hey these were some</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.510" end="00:18:36.740" style="s2">interesting things that happened during</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.890" end="00:18:39.320" style="s2">my time you know like what was said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.740" end="00:18:42.020" style="s2">great to like dig up and find people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.320" end="00:18:43.880" style="s2">Diaries and stuff like that but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">even sure they were written with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.880" end="00:18:55.790" style="s2">you know memoir thing on purpose so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:59.510" style="s2">yes a lot of people could do of audio</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.790" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">memoir of their life and then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.510" end="00:19:08.059" style="s2">put those into a database with tags for</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:10.669" style="s2">like themes regional you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.059" end="00:19:14.809" style="s2">regional tags you know where they grew</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.669" end="00:19:17.780" style="s2">up places they&#39;ve moved places they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.809" end="00:19:21.799" style="s2">worked I don&#39;t know whatever you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.780" end="00:19:23.540" style="s2">other interests that could be a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.799" end="00:19:27.140" style="s2">good thing because then we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.540" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">like that really like individual view</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.140" end="00:19:34.700" style="s2">which gives us some more clear broader</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:36.380" style="s2">view that would be cool and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.700" end="00:19:39.799" style="s2">what comes to mind I don&#39;t know totally</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.380" end="00:19:42.740" style="s2">how museums work but also on the museum</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.799" end="00:19:46.750" style="s2">thing I thought well there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.740" end="00:19:51.500" style="s2">museums that have the same theme but</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.750" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">like artifacts and certain items can</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.500" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">only be in one physical location at once</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:19:59.870" style="s2">what if there was like a way to network</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.030" end="00:20:01.940" style="s2">them all together so you&#39;re like enemies</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.870" end="00:20:04.610" style="s2">and then there&#39;s like a console that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.940" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">like here&#39;s all the other related</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.610" end="00:20:10.730" style="s2">artifacts that are across the world in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:12.980" style="s2">all these other museums and you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.730" end="00:20:15.290" style="s2">like flip through a catalog because like</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.980" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">hey we can only have 40 of these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.290" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">but actually there&#39;s 4,000 of them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:29.000" style="s2">like you can flip through them because</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;re all related in this topic from</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.000" end="00:20:34.250" style="s2">one location the evolution of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:36.380" style="s2">art or music but also the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.250" end="00:20:37.850" style="s2">throughout space right that is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.380" end="00:20:40.010" style="s2">in different places at different times</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">like here are the fertility statues that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.010" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">were coming out of as part of Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.140" style="s2">the fertility Scotchies are recorded as</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:46.280" style="s2">part of Asia at the same time period</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.140" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">even though they weren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.280" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">attracting each other so we can switch</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:52.850" style="s2">on to the other part which is because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:56.929" style="s2">think there was sparking ideas why I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.850" end="00:21:00.140" style="s2">in tears talking is I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.929" end="00:21:02.120" style="s2">something very very powerful here they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.140" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">could be done absolutely with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.120" end="00:21:07.910" style="s2">people and $100,000 but I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:12.340" style="s2">hear from you guys why do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.910" end="00:21:12.340" style="s2">can do with 10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.300" end="00:21:20.420" style="s2">because I told the likes of donkeys what</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.890" end="00:21:23.240" style="s2">does it get going all three of us do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.420" end="00:21:25.250" style="s2">know since I&#39;m no expert I do I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.240" end="00:21:29.090" style="s2">guess I just go from the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.250" end="00:21:35.800" style="s2">fruit of this conversation I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.090" end="00:21:39.110" style="s2">know what if you had a way for you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.800" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">you had 10,000 people that said I will</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.110" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">interview 10 people in my community and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">like put that all in a database and like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:51.650" style="s2">you pay them you give them a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">dollars to do it and then you know each</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.650" end="00:21:58.520" style="s2">interview they paid the interviewee 50</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">spread that all out and then you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.920" end="00:22:17.110" style="s2">a hundred thousand you know interview</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:24.800" style="s2">from all across wherever people were</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.570" end="00:22:31.850" style="s2">the idea - the one effort because if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.530" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">only have a hundred thousand dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:34.310" style="s2">you have ten thousand interviews in fact</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.950" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">interviewing people because then you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.630" end="00:29:06.770" style="s2">who they are you know I mean and as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:08.450" style="s2">surgery to a tendency to forget this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.770" end="00:29:10.870" style="s2">all down to relationships the whole a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:13.280" style="s2">life is down to relationship with others</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.870" end="00:29:15.950" style="s2">and a lot of people don&#39;t get that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.280" end="00:29:18.049" style="s2">just kind of look at your assume you die</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.950" end="00:29:20.900" style="s2">the commoners mark you&#39;ve got nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.049" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">value to it to them you&#39;ve got nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.900" end="00:29:25.970" style="s2">to offer and then they just dismiss you</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.740" end="00:29:32.630" style="s2">basically it so as I said create the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.900" end="00:29:35.240" style="s2">project where people could be having a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.630" end="00:29:37.100" style="s2">chart interview and just record it and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.240" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">think that would start and they would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.100" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">able to collect these and showcase them</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:43.370" style="s2">of where they are and what what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:46.309" style="s2">wear you know I mean so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.370" end="00:29:48.200" style="s2">would be really great I think also what</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.040" end="00:33:28.330" style="s2">it can be tremendously encouraging the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:31.240" style="s2">people I&#39;m also reminded about like how</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.330" end="00:33:35.170" style="s2">this could help society in a general way</p>

<p begin="00:43:01.369" end="00:43:06.619" style="s2">that and then sitting through and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.970" end="00:43:08.989" style="s2">watching you don&#39;t I mean 10 people tell</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.989" end="00:43:12.559" style="s2">memory is and their best memory and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.910" end="00:43:13.700" style="s2">something that you would only offer to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.559" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">the world if it&#39;s something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.700" end="00:43:20.239" style="s2">willing to share like what is your worst</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.890" style="s2">memory you&#39;re willing to share and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.239" end="00:43:23.809" style="s2">know on that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.890" end="00:43:26.359" style="s2">comes to mind and this is just something</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.809" end="00:43:31.609" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned from talking to folks is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.359" end="00:43:35.150" style="s2">that it appears that like my parents</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.609" end="00:43:38.950" style="s2">were baby boomer generation and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.150" end="00:43:44.119" style="s2">their parents the Silent Generation</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.950" end="00:43:46.729" style="s2">it appears that especially the men they</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.119" end="00:43:50.749" style="s2">were told something like my dad has even</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.729" end="00:43:54.950" style="s2">said this that vulnerability is a sign</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.749" end="00:43:57.049" style="s2">of weakness and so like I think we get a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.950" end="00:43:59.589" style="s2">lot out of these stories when people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.049" end="00:44:03.140" style="s2">able to talk about what didn&#39;t go well</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.589" end="00:44:07.880" style="s2">what you know they&#39;re failures I do</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.140" end="00:44:12.859" style="s2">think that we have some malicious code</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.880" end="00:44:16.700" style="s2">in there basically that says we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.859" end="00:44:19.099" style="s2">whole huge part of the generation that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.700" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">has basically been running the software</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.099" end="00:44:25.759" style="s2">that says don&#39;t ever talk about your</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">weaknesses and that was seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.759" end="00:44:30.380" style="s2">weakness especially as a man</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:33.380" style="s2">and I&#39;ll only talk about your successes</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.380" end="00:44:37.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s like we&#39;re missing a whole part</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.380" end="00:44:42.950" style="s2">of this of the story because that was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.700" end="00:44:44.780" style="s2">meme that has been going on I think we</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.950" end="00:44:49.130" style="s2">started we&#39;ve definitely started to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.780" end="00:44:54.440" style="s2">change that in our generation it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.130" end="00:44:58.670" style="s2">for me to think of my own father talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.440" end="00:45:00.740" style="s2">about that stuff whatever he views as</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.670" end="00:45:03.980" style="s2">negative because that&#39;s what me was told</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.740" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the number one thing you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.980" end="00:45:10.010" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about your failures just</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.230" style="s2">that&#39;s why like as I said everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.010" end="00:45:14.780" style="s2">talks about the success so you go</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.230" end="00:45:17.270" style="s2">through life thinking that you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.780" end="00:45:19.870" style="s2">attain this success or you know nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.270" end="00:45:22.370" style="s2">you you know you&#39;re seen as a failure</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.870" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">and if you look at the suicide rates</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.370" end="00:45:28.280" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly men young men do you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:30.230" style="s2">that that&#39;s why a lot of yeah I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.280" end="00:45:32.540" style="s2">make this up there&#39;s a book there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.230" end="00:45:34.370" style="s2">book called I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.540" end="00:45:37.640" style="s2">remember the author right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.370" end="00:45:40.970" style="s2">Terrence somebody it&#39;s the book is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.640" end="00:45:44.600" style="s2">called I don&#39;t want to talk about it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.970" end="00:45:47.660" style="s2">the subtext is a history of underlying</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.600" end="00:45:49.100" style="s2">depression and Men and like yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.660" end="00:45:52.010" style="s2">about that going through your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.100" end="00:45:54.830" style="s2">never being able to talk about what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.010" end="00:45:58.730" style="s2">is going on that will start you won&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.470" end="00:46:15.080" style="s2">on I didn&#39;t make this stuff up then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.590" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">flip side of that for women in a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.080" end="00:46:21.380" style="s2">heterosexual culture is that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:22.940" style="s2">emotional labor is put on us right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.380" end="00:46:25.010" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna talk about the what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.940" end="00:46:27.170" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about its to your</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.390" end="00:46:32.300" style="s2">only gonna be vulnerable with them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.890" end="00:46:34.250" style="s2">then we are taught not to love</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.300" end="00:46:36.230" style="s2">vulnerability necessarily in that space</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.250" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">so then it looks like your enemy like</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.230" end="00:46:41.390" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a yes yet show that I really</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.010" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">heterosexual sense but just in generally</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.750" end="00:48:30.700" style="s2">speaking whatever I mean the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:33.170" style="s2">history but we&#39;ve had a fascination</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:35.450" style="s2">leave together it was like a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.170" end="00:48:40.040" style="s2">thing that could be done to get like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.450" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">current verbal stories and video stories</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.040" end="00:48:45.290" style="s2">of who&#39;s alive today and then from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:46.820" style="s2">I think we see such richness that we go</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.290" end="00:48:47.840" style="s2">back in time right and we&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.820" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">we have these journals we have these</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.840" end="00:48:53.330" style="s2">photos how do we connect them how do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:55.069" style="s2">actually put them together but well I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.330" end="00:48:59.989" style="s2">think we&#39;ve got a history</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.069" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">longer-term of countries tribes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.989" end="00:49:05.180" style="s2">all competing with one another and so if</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:08.329" style="s2">you&#39;re competing you have to put up this</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.140" end="00:55:48.050" style="s2">gosh of my stories out there that could</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.780" end="00:55:50.540" style="s2">work against me somehow how could you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.050" end="00:55:53.750" style="s2">know just how could you protect against</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.540" end="00:55:55.220" style="s2">that what you could do right because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.750" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">know like when you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.220" end="00:56:01.160" style="s2">conversations with people and they get</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:04.280" style="s2">recorded you could actually actually ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.160" end="00:56:07.640" style="s2">them to listen to it back and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.280" end="00:56:08.869" style="s2">anything kin there may be edited some of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.640" end="00:56:10.970" style="s2">the stuff that they don&#39;t want in there</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.869" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">but actually give it back to them cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.970" end="00:56:16.580" style="s2">know through you doing filmmaking and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:18.470" style="s2">radio and everything sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.580" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">through college and that you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.470" end="00:56:22.010" style="s2">get people&#39;s consent well once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:24.619" style="s2">got their consent</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.010" end="00:56:26.420" style="s2">a lot of companies you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.619" end="00:56:28.070" style="s2">have anything to do with them after that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.420" end="00:56:29.960" style="s2">once you&#39;ve got the consent and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.070" end="00:56:31.820" style="s2">this is where they go wrong in most</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.960" end="00:56:34.070" style="s2">places they don&#39;t they don&#39;t show the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.820" end="00:56:36.260" style="s2">pace and what we&#39;ve done you don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.070" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">they get you know say is this or a field</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.260" end="00:56:41.089" style="s2">the more just interested in the content</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:43.670" style="s2">for the documentary or whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.089" end="00:56:45.890" style="s2">don&#39;t actually go back and ask them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.670" end="00:56:47.540" style="s2">say look this is what do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.890" end="00:56:49.339" style="s2">problems with this because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.540" end="00:56:50.869" style="s2">about budget it&#39;s all about getting it</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.339" end="00:56:53.089" style="s2">you know at me so they&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.869" end="00:56:55.580" style="s2">interest in the person that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.089" end="00:56:57.770" style="s2">actually took the stories from which I</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.580" end="00:57:00.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s quite wrong really you know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.770" end="00:57:03.170" style="s2">mean and as I said you could say right</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.680" end="00:57:06.530" style="s2">listen to that bass is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.170" end="00:57:08.359" style="s2">there that you don&#39;t want us to to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.530" end="00:57:11.390" style="s2">know I mean and then we&#39;ll take it out</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.359" end="00:57:12.770" style="s2">and we&#39;ll edit it so yeah yeah having</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.390" end="00:57:14.690" style="s2">the person who&#39;s interviewed give the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.770" end="00:57:17.089" style="s2">consent is huge yeah I think also</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.690" end="00:57:19.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain width with council</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.089" end="00:57:21.589" style="s2">culture and influencer culture how it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.400" end="00:57:22.580" style="s2">one person has 20 million views five of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.589" end="00:57:24.500" style="s2">them don&#39;t like them they could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.580" end="00:57:24.859" style="s2">cancelled because it feels yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.500" end="00:57:27.530" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.859" end="00:57:30.020" style="s2">but there&#39;s the flip side of that where</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.530" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like share like someone says</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.020" end="00:57:32.869" style="s2">something racist right and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">gonna pull that out and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.869" end="00:57:38.030" style="s2">shame them for it and we&#39;re gonna or how</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:39.920" style="s2">will we all share stories or we were</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.030" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">racist right because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:43.579" style="s2">going to help move racism</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:46.609" style="s2">further then shaving people for their</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.579" end="00:57:48.650" style="s2">moment of racism right like hey when my</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.609" end="00:57:50.329" style="s2">Korean friend got married and they had</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.650" end="00:57:53.059" style="s2">live fish at the wedding shark fin soup</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.329" end="00:57:55.220" style="s2">I was not most magnanimous friend right</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.059" end="00:57:59.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s real story then I would get</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.220" end="00:58:02.569" style="s2">into if I needed to write for the like</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.240" end="00:58:04.430" style="s2">the idea that revenge porn happens and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.569" end="00:58:04.940" style="s2">then you as a woman because it happens</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.430" end="00:58:08.779" style="s2">to women</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.940" end="00:58:10.970" style="s2">no one cares man has then they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.779" end="00:58:13.490" style="s2">President and they can&#39;t be CEO well if</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.970" end="00:58:15.519" style="s2">everyone is then actually it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.490" end="00:58:18.049" style="s2">matter right if everyone has naked</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.519" end="00:58:20.749" style="s2">pictures of their body out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.049" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">actually be an immunization for it</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.749" end="00:58:24.710" style="s2">rather than like no no no no your body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:26.569" style="s2">sacred nobody Sheraton picture the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.710" end="00:58:29.809" style="s2">actual solution is everybody share it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.569" end="00:58:31.910" style="s2">who wants to no shame in it right and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.809" end="00:58:33.349" style="s2">I think there is I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.910" end="00:58:34.999" style="s2">that&#39;s necessarily what would happen and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.349" end="00:58:36.589" style="s2">or what should happen but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.999" end="00:58:39.740" style="s2">certain amount of how we protect each</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.589" end="00:58:41.210" style="s2">other is doing what they did like not go</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.740" end="00:58:41.660" style="s2">out and yell at the black guy in Central</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.210" end="00:58:43.970" style="s2">Park</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.660" end="00:58:46.069" style="s2">no that was over-the-top and wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.970" end="00:58:47.869" style="s2">yes here&#39;s the story of me when I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.069" end="00:58:48.680" style="s2">racist I can only imagine if someone had</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.869" end="00:58:50.869" style="s2">a camera on me</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.680" end="00:58:52.819" style="s2">right here&#39;s my worst moment for</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.869" end="00:58:54.950" style="s2">homophobia here&#39;s my weirdest moment for</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.819" end="00:58:57.230" style="s2">this and when there&#39;s tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.950" end="00:58:59.509" style="s2">of them you can see okay and then how</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.230" end="00:59:00.950" style="s2">did you grow beyond that how have you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.509" end="00:59:04.789" style="s2">learned from that right is a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.950" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">story forward well you could do with</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.789" end="00:59:09.499" style="s2">that you could have they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:10.670" style="s2">if they wanted to share something but he</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.499" end="00:59:13.549" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to but you could have it as</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.670" end="00:59:14.989" style="s2">anonymous maybe just of the location</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.549" end="00:59:17.450" style="s2">every way</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.989" end="00:59:20.569" style="s2">and maybe I will the way you just have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.450" end="00:59:22.730" style="s2">it as anonymous and the guy you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.569" end="00:59:24.049" style="s2">think that hurts the other part though</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.730" end="00:59:28.339" style="s2">cuz then it&#39;s like well the nonnamous</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.049" end="00:59:29.960" style="s2">porn and I think a lot of it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.339" end="00:59:32.329" style="s2">retrospect right it&#39;s like you told a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.960" end="00:59:34.339" style="s2">story what&#39;s happening with the tearing</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.329" end="00:59:36.799" style="s2">down of the statues right the people at</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.339" end="00:59:38.989" style="s2">the time thought they were fine right</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.799" end="00:59:41.180" style="s2">having slaves is normal having like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.989" end="00:59:43.160" style="s2">is normal and then now that history is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.180" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">happening well weren&#39;t currently alive</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.160" end="00:59:48.200" style="s2">right this is history 200 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:49.999" style="s2">we can see what happens to slave owners</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.200" end="00:59:52.130" style="s2">who are our current slave owners right</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.999" end="00:59:54.259" style="s2">Birds her current you don&#39;t get to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.130" end="00:59:54.810" style="s2">the white guy hero from history and how</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.259" end="00:59:56.670" style="s2">your sad</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.810" end="00:59:58.620" style="s2">you up there if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.670" end="01:00:01.050" style="s2">asshole so maybe don&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.620" end="01:00:02.670" style="s2">asshole right like I think there is but</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.050" end="01:00:04.470" style="s2">how do you know you don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.670" end="01:00:07.170" style="s2">is to be a asshole 200 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.470" end="01:00:08.490" style="s2">from now you can think maybe right like</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.170" end="01:00:10.680" style="s2">maybe you need to be vegan maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.490" end="01:00:12.540" style="s2">need to be I&#39;m not going vegan so my</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.680" end="01:00:15.680" style="s2">great-grandkids can think that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.540" end="01:00:18.750" style="s2">good person they can be vegan</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.680" end="01:00:21.810" style="s2">anyway so what I&#39;m hearing is one</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.750" end="01:00:25.860" style="s2">potential way to do this is probably not</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.810" end="01:00:30.180" style="s2">live in order to help someone be safe</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.860" end="01:00:31.650" style="s2">and be very candid you say when I can do</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.180" end="01:00:33.450" style="s2">this live we&#39;re gonna record this</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.650" end="01:00:35.910" style="s2">because I want you to be very candid and</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.910" end="01:00:41.820" style="s2">gonna go back through and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.030" end="01:00:44.760" style="s2">about if there&#39;s anything you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.820" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">want in the final thing you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.760" end="01:00:50.940" style="s2">open to omitting things but for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:55.290" style="s2">initial recording just talk off the top</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.940" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">of your head and then anyways that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.290" end="01:01:01.740" style="s2">of that&#39;s what I&#39;m hearing that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:02.040" style="s2">pretty good yeah I think so I like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.740" end="01:01:03.900" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.040" end="01:01:05.190" style="s2">I also think starting if we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.900" end="01:01:07.560" style="s2">actually gonna start this project</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.190" end="01:01:10.170" style="s2">starting with like the top five</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.560" end="01:01:11.940" style="s2">questions to talk to any questions so</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.170" end="01:01:13.350" style="s2">that they were similar between who</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.940" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">wanted to have them some of interviewing</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.350" end="01:01:16.050" style="s2">my dad I know what stories I want to ask</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:17.640" style="s2">him right but they&#39;re gonna be different</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.050" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">than what I&#39;m going to ask my mom or</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.640" end="01:01:22.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna ask other grandmother um</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:25.080" style="s2">but there&#39;s gonna be commonality and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.710" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">picking what is common so that we know</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.080" end="01:01:29.460" style="s2">to do that and then you can also ask</p>
