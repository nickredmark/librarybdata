<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:15.010" style="s2">what it what is what is coming to me as</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.929" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">right is is really gathering the notion</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.010" end="00:02:19.030" style="s2">of what I&#39;ve been doing in developing</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">and circling first you know since the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.030" end="00:02:29.950" style="s2">early 90s and linking it to the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:31.330" style="s2">notion of dialogue owes so John&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:33.490" style="s2">be on that with me</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.330" end="00:02:37.510" style="s2">Chris&#39;s could be on that with me I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.490" end="00:02:39.580" style="s2">if hopefully if Jordan Jordan Hall was</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.510" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">available hopefully he&#39;ll attend to and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.580" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re gonna it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">be the first time of formally as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">experiment having all of us enact this</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">process and finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:53.830" style="s2">constraints and the right way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:56.830" style="s2">transition from one into the other and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.830" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">back and forth so this dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.830" end="00:03:00.940" style="s2">we&#39;re having is really getting clear on</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:03.850" style="s2">some of those notions and of course it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.940" end="00:03:05.320" style="s2">turned into dialogue us and have it led</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.850" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">to all these other things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.320" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">certain moment where John was like I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">it this is what I&#39;ve been trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:16.360" style="s2">exemplifying everything that we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:17.709" style="s2">talking about so so beautiful I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.360" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">believe my life I have to pinch myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.709" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">sometimes so so you can also watch this</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">as a preparation for that and to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">more of a conceptual sense of it because</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">this this this session is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:39.370" style="s2">mostly very little lecture just enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:42.310" style="s2">to get us oriented for us to experiment</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.169" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">videos because I&#39;ve got doing the voices</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.870" end="00:04:55.180" style="s2">with verve a key as well as still trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">to release sort of the lecture styles</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.180" end="00:05:00.610" style="s2">when I can and also on doing the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:03.580" style="s2">live streaming of the meditation class</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.610" end="00:05:05.260" style="s2">every morning now too and so what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.580" end="00:05:11.470" style="s2">see what&#39;s that been like for you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.260" end="00:05:14.889" style="s2">been enjoying those a lot so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.470" end="00:05:17.220" style="s2">very helpful to me because I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.889" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">lot of encouraging feedback from people</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:22.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s giving me a sense doing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">lot of the videos especially around the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.300" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">COBIT and sort of existential and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:30.610" style="s2">philosophical responses to them and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:33.729" style="s2">doing the meditation videos with people</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.610" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">has really given me a sense of of trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.729" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">to do something to help and to intervene</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.580" end="00:05:40.389" style="s2">I&#39;m like obviously nothing comparable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">what the health care workers are doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.389" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to make that comparison</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.770" end="00:05:48.490" style="s2">but the fact that I can perhaps help</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:50.500" style="s2">people address the meaning aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.490" end="00:05:53.500" style="s2">this and the existential aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.500" end="00:05:56.169" style="s2">and the cognitive aspects that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.500" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">helpful to me because it&#39;s reduced my</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.169" end="00:06:01.460" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">just sort of being just passively</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.460" end="00:06:06.440" style="s2">suffering the crisis that&#39;s allowed me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:08.060" style="s2">to connect with people what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.440" end="00:06:10.550" style="s2">interesting is like there&#39;s a community</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.060" end="00:06:12.620" style="s2">now forming all the people that come on</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.550" end="00:06:14.150" style="s2">actually online and they&#39;re all there</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.620" end="00:06:16.250" style="s2">and they&#39;re there often now talking to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.150" end="00:06:19.729" style="s2">each other way before the class starts</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.250" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">and things like that and so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.729" end="00:06:24.500" style="s2">really really wonderful and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:25.699" style="s2">happy to get the series out there</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.500" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">because if now it&#39;ll be a you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.699" end="00:06:32.690" style="s2">long-standing and finally especially for</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.539" style="s2">today for example although this has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.690" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">a pattern across so I was teaching about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.539" end="00:06:41.630" style="s2">meta contemplation today and it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:43.849" style="s2">all came together in a powerful way and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.630" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve taught this course many many many</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.849" end="00:06:47.479" style="s2">times in person but there was something</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">about doing it in this context that made</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.479" end="00:06:53.900" style="s2">me sharpen things up I think a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:56.539" style="s2">bit more those are all the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.900" end="00:07:00.229" style="s2">positives and they keep me going the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.539" end="00:07:02.990" style="s2">negative has been that my it read sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.229" end="00:07:06.979" style="s2">of Reaper off backup sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.990" end="00:07:09.139" style="s2">fears of social exposure and those were</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.979" end="00:07:11.180" style="s2">exacerbated and it&#39;s hard to tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.139" end="00:07:13.969" style="s2">chicken and egg kind of thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.180" end="00:07:16.219" style="s2">fact that my ears been really bad on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.969" end="00:07:17.690" style="s2">moon years and so it&#39;s actually making</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.219" end="00:07:23.449" style="s2">it was making it so physically difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.690" end="00:07:25.330" style="s2">to set but so many people found it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.449" end="00:07:28.969" style="s2">this again was I&#39;m so grateful for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.330" end="00:07:32.030" style="s2">so many people found it helpful to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.969" end="00:07:35.509" style="s2">me doing what I can even in distress to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.030" end="00:07:37.639" style="s2">keep you know doing the practice where</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.509" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">you know and and trying to properly</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.639" end="00:07:41.750" style="s2">defend myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:43.159" style="s2">they found that very very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.750" end="00:07:45.110" style="s2">and that and then that in turn was</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.159" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">encouraging and helpful to me to keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.110" end="00:07:49.219" style="s2">going so in fact what we&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:51.169" style="s2">we&#39;ve extended it we were doing two GU</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.219" end="00:07:52.759" style="s2">teaching sessions per week and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.169" end="00:07:54.650" style="s2">would have been a five-week course we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">did I&#39;d we decided to slow it down so</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.650" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">people could catch up and get more</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:08:02.270" style="s2">practice in and we&#39;re doing one teaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:03.979" style="s2">per week and now for a 10-week course so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.270" end="00:08:06.650" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s at but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.979" end="00:08:09.259" style="s2">been it&#39;s been it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:10.910" style="s2">very good it&#39;s I don&#39;t want to say fun</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.259" end="00:08:14.060" style="s2">because it&#39;s been very challenging in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.910" end="00:08:17.419" style="s2">lot of ways it&#39;s also been really good</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.060" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">really meaningful you know what you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.419" end="00:08:22.130" style="s2">about you know it&#39;s interesting because</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.140" end="00:08:37.820" style="s2">just this has some context for that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.669" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">this is it&#39;s funny because I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.820" end="00:08:47.029" style="s2">it come together in me right when I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">when we asked to do this and I Peter</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.029" end="00:08:53.000" style="s2">Limburg you know said hey come and put</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.830" style="s2">like a one sentence descriptor and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.000" end="00:08:58.100" style="s2">said I said something about like I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.830" end="00:09:03.650" style="s2">I said something about like yeah come</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.100" end="00:09:07.790" style="s2">circle the meta-crisis where we we we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.650" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">enter into authenticity into dialo goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.790" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">right in other words make this</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.190" end="00:09:13.910" style="s2">transition right from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:16.279" style="s2">additionally what a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.910" end="00:09:21.010" style="s2">traditionally think about as circling</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.279" end="00:09:25.850" style="s2">mm-hmm this is an inner subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.010" end="00:09:31.160" style="s2">meditation into it going into dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.850" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">oh right yeah each other and so since I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.160" end="00:09:36.709" style="s2">wrote that it&#39;s almost been as if that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:38.690" style="s2">was like an attractor based and for all</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.709" end="00:09:40.730" style="s2">the conversations that we&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.690" end="00:09:42.529" style="s2">oh very much and this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.730" end="00:09:46.490" style="s2">imagining and this is often my</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.529" end="00:09:48.440" style="s2">experience actually in teaching if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.490" end="00:09:51.620" style="s2">think what you just mentioned about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.440" end="00:09:55.160" style="s2">meditation mm-hmm they often find this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.620" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">when I&#39;m teaching course where what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.160" end="00:10:00.529" style="s2">been thinking about with the person or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:03.020" style="s2">student or a lecture that I&#39;m giving or</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.529" end="00:10:04.940" style="s2">making a distinction where everything I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.020" end="00:10:07.850" style="s2">was thinking about just comes together</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.940" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">and yeah yeah really the dates in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.850" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">moment they&#39;re very much yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:13.580" style="s2">very much that&#39;s what said yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:15.589" style="s2">very much the case I would I noted that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.580" end="00:10:17.270" style="s2">to you how we&#39;re sort of happy with</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.589" end="00:10:19.980" style="s2">carrying things around in our head and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.270" end="00:10:22.850" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat fragmented make fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.980" end="00:10:25.020" style="s2">but well we have to enter into a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.850" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">discourse or dialogue or perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.020" end="00:10:30.300" style="s2">deal logos with people that is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:33.420" style="s2">acceptable it it alters your</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.300" end="00:10:36.570" style="s2">perspectival standard right and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.420" end="00:10:38.400" style="s2">becomes much more demanding and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.570" end="00:10:40.680" style="s2">that&#39;s really really cool that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.400" end="00:10:44.520" style="s2">the great pleasures of teaching yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.680" end="00:10:47.640" style="s2">fact if that&#39;s happening for you and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.520" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">can share that moment of learning when</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.640" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching that&#39;s better than just</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:57.570" style="s2">the dissemination of information to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:58.680" style="s2">people I find yeah my wife just reminded</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.570" end="00:11:01.410" style="s2">me to keep it down</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:02.820" style="s2">I get excited and then the neighbors if</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.410" end="00:11:04.860" style="s2">we just moved into it</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:08.940" style="s2">a thin wall so oh I see I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:13.430" style="s2">getting complaints from the neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.940" end="00:11:19.530" style="s2">and um I should just blame you instead</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.520" end="00:11:38.010" style="s2">exercises that kind of get people into</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:41.670" style="s2">that space and in some you know oak that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.010" end="00:11:43.230" style="s2">transition so transition points which I</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.670" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">think are gonna be essential and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.230" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">really interesting is is that it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:51.060" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna really call on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:52.650" style="s2">agency and you know and their</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.060" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">sovereignty to really do this because a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.650" end="00:11:57.300" style="s2">lot of some of these things take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:59.190" style="s2">of practice to learn right and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.300" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">tolerance for what I&#39;m gonna call fumble</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.190" end="00:12:03.300" style="s2">fuckin right in a recommendation so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">really looking forward to setting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.300" end="00:12:07.830" style="s2">context for that and design in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.210" style="s2">middle of designing the exercises and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.830" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">was thinking it would be great if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.210" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">like the four of us could get together</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:14.640" style="s2">and just do like a demo at different</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:18.030" style="s2">things and go through all the exercises</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.640" end="00:12:19.410" style="s2">and and then demo demo something and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.030" end="00:12:21.630" style="s2">have them go and break up into groups</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:24.650" style="s2">and do it and come back together and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.630" end="00:12:26.730" style="s2">talk about it and yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.650" end="00:12:30.390" style="s2">explicate the very thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.730" end="00:12:32.910" style="s2">attempting to create yeah I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.390" end="00:12:33.640" style="s2">interested in this I&#39;m very capito and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.910" end="00:12:34.839" style="s2">even work</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.640" end="00:12:37.750" style="s2">Lindburgh and i have been working on</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.839" end="00:12:39.399" style="s2">trying to figure out the right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.750" end="00:12:42.070" style="s2">constellation the right what I call</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.399" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">pedagogical program right sequencing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.070" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">feedback relationships between these</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:50.860" style="s2">various practices to try and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">get the best pedagogical progression</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:57.160" style="s2">through them so we need a lot more of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">this online stuff where we&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.160" end="00:13:01.720" style="s2">things out as long as people understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">that this is very much a work in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.720" end="00:13:05.829" style="s2">progress in experimental I think it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:08.860" style="s2">should be very good yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.829" end="00:13:10.630" style="s2">so so I actually this this will be kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.860" end="00:13:12.010" style="s2">of a little different we&#39;ll see right</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.630" end="00:13:14.260" style="s2">but it&#39;ll be a little different of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.010" end="00:13:17.820" style="s2">dialog for both of you and I cuz I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.260" end="00:13:21.850" style="s2">some specific questions yes right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.820" end="00:13:24.040" style="s2">yeah totally that that are actually have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.850" end="00:13:25.740" style="s2">come out of our conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.040" end="00:13:28.510" style="s2">they&#39;re deep end</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.740" end="00:13:31.510" style="s2">as I&#39;ve been taking lots of walks lately</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.510" end="00:13:33.130" style="s2">to get out of the house you know they</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:37.240" style="s2">come up to it while I&#39;m walking and so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.130" end="00:13:39.820" style="s2">did make a little note of them but one</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.240" end="00:13:42.670" style="s2">of them that has been the very striking</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.820" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">to me and I should really share this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.670" end="00:13:47.079" style="s2">with you is this sense of what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:49.209" style="s2">believe is it was actually in our last</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.079" end="00:13:52.440" style="s2">one-on-one dialogue where you had said</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.209" end="00:13:54.730" style="s2">something the likes of you know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.440" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">philosophy or the practice of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.730" end="00:14:04.060" style="s2">and dialogue owes isn&#39;t just a as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:05.800" style="s2">see it I think you were referencing how</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.060" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve been observing and participating</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.800" end="00:14:11.290" style="s2">in other practices like meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:14.140" style="s2">circling and often authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.290" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">practices embodiment practice and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.140" end="00:14:19.000" style="s2">basically taking like yeah yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:21.970" style="s2">thing is kind of missing for you and me</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.000" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">and these things was the was dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:29.649" style="s2">owes and philosophy and in what struck</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:30.430" style="s2">me is is is in that conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.649" end="00:14:35.010" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.430" end="00:14:36.190" style="s2">it just felt deeply true which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.010" end="00:14:38.920" style="s2">philosophy a--</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.190" end="00:14:43.529" style="s2">or the practice of philosophy may not</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.920" end="00:14:46.180" style="s2">just be a preferable adjunct right who</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.529" end="00:14:47.740" style="s2">practices attempting to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.180" end="00:14:50.910" style="s2">meeting crisis but they</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.740" end="00:14:55.030" style="s2">it may actually be something necessary</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:14:56.470" style="s2">in the absence of which may actually be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.030" end="00:14:58.810" style="s2">the difference between it being a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:15:02.970" style="s2">genuine response to what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.810" end="00:15:05.260" style="s2">not and that just I noticed for me can</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.970" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">consolidated it for me and that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.260" end="00:15:09.640" style="s2">was like okay Chris let&#39;s let&#39;s read the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:12.460" style="s2">dialogues let&#39;s yeah yeah good thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.640" end="00:15:13.960" style="s2">you&#39;re doing that so I&#39;m just curious</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.460" end="00:15:19.870" style="s2">for you like I guess my first question</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.960" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">is you know what is what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.870" end="00:15:26.740" style="s2">is the the practice of philosophy ax</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:30.400" style="s2">right in dialogue OHS and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.740" end="00:15:32.760" style="s2">about it that makes it something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.400" end="00:15:37.470" style="s2">that actually is crucial or necessary</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.760" end="00:15:39.820" style="s2">right along with these other practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.470" end="00:15:41.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s a really excellent question I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.820" end="00:15:43.210" style="s2">want to go through this really slowly</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.080" end="00:15:48.010" style="s2">and carefully because it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.210" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">that I am I&#39;m thinking a lot about which</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.010" end="00:15:52.210" style="s2">means it&#39;s very much a work in progress</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:56.710" style="s2">for me because I&#39;m trying as best I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.210" end="00:15:59.200" style="s2">to do this double act of being deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.710" end="00:16:01.990" style="s2">responsible to a reconstruction as best</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.200" end="00:16:05.320" style="s2">I can with all the help I can get of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.990" end="00:16:08.440" style="s2">ancient practice well getting you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.320" end="00:16:10.780" style="s2">staying true to these emerging existing</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.440" end="00:16:14.830" style="s2">practices and so that&#39;s been its it</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.780" end="00:16:23.710" style="s2">that&#39;s as a significant challenge so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.830" end="00:16:27.430" style="s2">thing for me that what philosophy is and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.710" end="00:16:30.520" style="s2">I use that term because I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.430" end="00:16:31.780" style="s2">about what&#39;s traditionally or sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.520" end="00:16:34.330" style="s2">the tradition is the wrong word what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.780" end="00:16:36.700" style="s2">currently for a long time since perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.330" end="00:16:38.230" style="s2">the Enlightenment like understood by</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.700" end="00:16:39.910" style="s2">philosophy with so let&#39;s call that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.230" end="00:16:43.720" style="s2">academic philosophy and I want to state</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.910" end="00:16:46.080" style="s2">right up front that I believe in and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.720" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">think academic philosophy is important</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.080" end="00:16:52.210" style="s2">it really is and I have a PhD in it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:54.400" style="s2">stuff like that and so you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.210" end="00:17:00.370" style="s2">but there&#39;s a sense in which I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.400" end="00:17:05.230" style="s2">understand how that specialists task</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.370" end="00:17:09.699" style="s2">is not sought-after and may not even be</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.230" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">needed by most people but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.699" end="00:17:18.790" style="s2">philosophy ax is yeah because philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:22.120" style="s2">ax is the task of bringing various</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.790" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">strategies of rational reflection and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.120" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">want to ask people to give me charity</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:27.160" style="s2">here because I&#39;ve done a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:30.010" style="s2">trying to expand the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.160" end="00:17:33.630" style="s2">rationality and expand the notion of no</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.010" end="00:17:35.560" style="s2">a beyond logical manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.630" end="00:17:37.570" style="s2">propositions and beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.560" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">propositional knowing so I&#39;m using both</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.570" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">knowing and reflecting and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:44.800" style="s2">and rationality and a much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:46.360" style="s2">comprehensive sense so for me meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.800" end="00:17:48.910" style="s2">as you mentioned earlier is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.360" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">importantly rational activity because it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.910" end="00:17:53.500" style="s2">systematically and reliably reduces</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.500" end="00:17:56.650" style="s2">within our attentional processing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.360" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.650" end="00:18:03.730" style="s2">so philosophy a-- is an attempt to bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.360" end="00:18:07.990" style="s2">rational reflection and enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.730" end="00:18:11.920" style="s2">understanding to write our processing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.990" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">a powerful way and so what I saw</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.920" end="00:18:18.010" style="s2">happening was what I see happening in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:22.650" style="s2">these practices is there&#39;s a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.010" end="00:18:25.330" style="s2">I would call you know interactive</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.650" end="00:18:26.890" style="s2">reflection people are reflecting on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.330" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">interaction and they were reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.890" end="00:18:33.429" style="s2">their sort of state of mind and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s good right but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.429" end="00:18:41.410" style="s2">put in the service of trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:44.380" style="s2">about a reflective enhancement of our</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.410" end="00:18:50.620" style="s2">understanding of the processes of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.380" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">meaning making so one of the things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.620" end="00:18:54.580" style="s2">for example what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:58.030" style="s2">four-way deal logos with you and I on</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.580" end="00:19:00.550" style="s2">Chris and Jordan is we don&#39;t just circle</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.030" end="00:19:02.290" style="s2">we that we also do something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.550" end="00:19:04.840" style="s2">enough others so we do this really</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.290" end="00:19:08.620" style="s2">important move right there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.840" end="00:19:10.990" style="s2">phenomena that emerges let&#39;s call it in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">the circling aspect this is collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.990" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">flow state and we know when we&#39;re in it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:15.669" style="s2">because we</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:17.650" style="s2">feel the Jazz happening I&#39;m gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.669" end="00:19:22.299" style="s2">that collective flow state but then what</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.650" end="00:19:24.820" style="s2">will happen is that phenomena instead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.299" end="00:19:28.779" style="s2">being something that we&#39;re immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.820" end="00:19:31.169" style="s2">in order to engender the flow one of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.779" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">will often step back and we will we will</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.169" end="00:19:35.980" style="s2">question it now not in the not in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:38.620" style="s2">canary ASSA t sense of well what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.980" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">right this is more in the Wonder sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.620" end="00:19:43.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like what is that what is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:48.159" style="s2">disclosing what is that what is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.620" end="00:19:51.340" style="s2">exemplifying about the this process that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.159" end="00:19:55.240" style="s2">I care so much about what way of life is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.340" end="00:19:57.730" style="s2">it portending what kind of person is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.240" end="00:19:59.710" style="s2">affording me to aspire to becoming right</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.730" end="00:20:04.059" style="s2">and this is what philosophy Oh was about</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.710" end="00:20:06.190" style="s2">trying to get an understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.059" end="00:20:08.230" style="s2">possibilities are available to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.190" end="00:20:10.149" style="s2">aspirational possibilities the wit</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.230" end="00:20:13.299" style="s2">ontological possibilities of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.149" end="00:20:15.100" style="s2">relate to ourselves to other people to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.299" end="00:20:18.370" style="s2">being in general and you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.100" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">be like in order to be it helps it helps</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.370" end="00:20:23.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be like versed in</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:26.289" style="s2">technical philosophy to do this if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.890" end="00:20:27.610" style="s2">know because obviously it started with</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.289" end="00:20:28.809" style="s2">people like Socrates who weren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.610" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">technically worse because there just</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.809" end="00:20:36.250" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that much around right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.990" end="00:20:40.600" style="s2">idea here is can we can we get to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.250" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">place where and and this is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.600" end="00:20:48.250" style="s2">really sweet spot where I&#39;m staying in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:52.570" style="s2">touch with the online organic flow of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.250" end="00:20:55.240" style="s2">the phenomena of logos of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.570" end="00:20:58.840" style="s2">taking on a life of its own but can I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.240" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">also let it tutor me can I let it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.840" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">educate me can I can I hit it can I let</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:06.429" style="s2">it draw out for me a reflective</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">understanding and we have to be and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.429" end="00:21:10.090" style="s2">notice what we do we we we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.380" end="00:21:11.799" style="s2">challenge each other and we question and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.090" end="00:21:15.460" style="s2">we build and we elucidate and go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.799" end="00:21:20.500" style="s2">right because we&#39;re not we&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.460" end="00:21:23.350" style="s2">satisfied now with any quick intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.500" end="00:21:26.110" style="s2">oh well that&#39;s just that an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.350" end="00:21:27.610" style="s2">understanding right nor with some merely</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.110" end="00:21:29.140" style="s2">technical labor</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.610" end="00:21:30.910" style="s2">you see in the Socratic dialogues that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.140" end="00:21:33.910" style="s2">Socrates is always trying to steer</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.910" end="00:21:36.520" style="s2">between these two options we have for</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.910" end="00:21:37.960" style="s2">premature closure that&#39;s why I often say</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.520" end="00:21:40.990" style="s2">the questioning that we&#39;re doing is more</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.960" end="00:21:44.110" style="s2">like questing and we&#39;re not flying right</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.990" end="00:21:45.820" style="s2">to close off the phenomena instead the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.110" end="00:21:48.870" style="s2">reflective understanding is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.820" end="00:21:52.390" style="s2">correct ways we might be self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.870" end="00:21:54.520" style="s2">premature miss frame yet so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.390" end="00:21:57.250" style="s2">actually open it up for more disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.520" end="00:22:01.270" style="s2">so we&#39;re going back and forth between</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">the phenomena in flow right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.270" end="00:22:06.460" style="s2">theoretical reflection and we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:09.670" style="s2">to keep them really resonant in sync</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.460" end="00:22:12.970" style="s2">with each other so that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.670" end="00:22:15.190" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not just argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.970" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">argumentation in all of its senses is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.190" end="00:22:23.260" style="s2">there but it&#39;s also exemplification</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:27.490" style="s2">right right and and and so we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.260" end="00:22:31.000" style="s2">in philosophy R to disclose not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.490" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">ways of thinking but ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.000" end="00:22:36.970" style="s2">make them aspirationally attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:39.130" style="s2">people that&#39;s what I mean by philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.970" end="00:22:42.630" style="s2">a-- and why is that needed well why is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.130" end="00:22:46.990" style="s2">that needed because this is the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.630" end="00:22:51.640" style="s2">this this is the philosophy uh India</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.990" end="00:22:53.380" style="s2">logos I think is what Jordan John Hall</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.640" end="00:22:54.790" style="s2">and he seems to be an agreement with</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.380" end="00:22:56.680" style="s2">this because he keeps meeting with us</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.790" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">right and keeps talking with me to what</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.680" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">said what was needed which is a meta</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:03.310" style="s2">psychic technology in addition to all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:07.240" style="s2">these practices we need a meta practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.310" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">that is designed to curate and that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.240" end="00:23:11.590" style="s2">you know cultivate the occult the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.680" style="s2">individual colleagues practice this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.590" end="00:23:17.560" style="s2">the place where we tap into the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.680" end="00:23:20.260" style="s2">resources simultaneously of individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.560" end="00:23:22.060" style="s2">cognition and distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.260" end="00:23:24.100" style="s2">we Ratchet it up as much as we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.060" end="00:23:26.230" style="s2">individual rationality collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.100" end="00:23:29.140" style="s2">rationality individual wisdom collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.230" end="00:23:32.020" style="s2">wisdom so we get the best wisdom we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.140" end="00:23:34.680" style="s2">have for the ecology of practices and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.020" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">think that&#39;s why it&#39;s indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.680" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">totally as you&#39;re talking about this I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:43.940" style="s2">was flashing too</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:46.039" style="s2">so what so for example what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.940" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">things that has happened for me in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.039" end="00:23:53.570" style="s2">dialoguing with you is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:56.659" style="s2">bring to bed if you ask a question for</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.570" end="00:23:58.369" style="s2">example right year you&#39;ve asked me</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.659" end="00:24:01.519" style="s2">questions before in those dial up in</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.369" end="00:24:03.320" style="s2">those dialogue OSA cysts that are that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.519" end="00:24:06.039" style="s2">that is a struggle for me to answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.320" end="00:24:09.999" style="s2">right so you asked me a question and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.039" end="00:24:13.789" style="s2">it&#39;s as if in answering it right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.999" end="00:24:15.739" style="s2">walking towards the answer of it and at</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.789" end="00:24:18.549" style="s2">the end of may or may not have answered</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.739" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">it but because you bring to bear all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.549" end="00:24:26.809" style="s2">your um like the horizons of being a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:28.460" style="s2">scientist to philosopher of all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.809" end="00:24:30.710" style="s2">different things that you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.460" end="00:24:33.320" style="s2">that they&#39;re probably just implicit for</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:37.249" style="s2">you in that point and I&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.320" end="00:24:39.409" style="s2">been around anybody with in that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.249" end="00:24:42.139" style="s2">brings to bear all those things right in</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.409" end="00:24:44.239" style="s2">answering those questions I&#39;ll I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.139" end="00:24:47.059" style="s2">at the end and I may not may not have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.239" end="00:24:51.529" style="s2">had answered the question but then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.059" end="00:24:53.269" style="s2">look up and what the horizons write is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.529" end="00:24:56.269" style="s2">like I&#39;m in event you draw me into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.269" end="00:24:59.779" style="s2">valley and then I look up and I&#39;m now in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.269" end="00:25:02.389" style="s2">different meaning horizons and those</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.779" end="00:25:04.669" style="s2">those horizons I look around at and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.389" end="00:25:09.320" style="s2">things occur the very same things occur</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.669" end="00:25:11.029" style="s2">differently to me and I and there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.320" end="00:25:12.529" style="s2">sense in which there is really that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.029" end="00:25:14.059" style="s2">sense in which we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.529" end="00:25:17.499" style="s2">traveling together and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.059" end="00:25:20.570" style="s2">something guiding the inquiry yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.499" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">somehow does it because of the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:24.950" style="s2">flow there&#39;s an absorption into it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:26.599" style="s2">then at some point I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.950" end="00:25:28.909" style="s2">talking about somebody&#39;s just back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.599" end="00:25:30.440" style="s2">goes what is this thing that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.909" end="00:25:34.789" style="s2">right here how did you know that&#39;s than</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.440" end="00:25:36.979" style="s2">that right so that yeah I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.789" end="00:25:39.979" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of thinking about that is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.979" end="00:25:44.229" style="s2">giving voice to the logos right rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.979" end="00:25:48.019" style="s2">than right relying the logos is my name</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.229" end="00:25:50.059" style="s2">for that that that way in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.019" end="00:25:51.799" style="s2">something like a dynamical system takes</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.059" end="00:25:54.509" style="s2">shape it takes on a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.799" end="00:25:56.339" style="s2">it&#39;s it it&#39;s gathering right</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.509" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s gathering together so things come</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.339" end="00:26:00.269" style="s2">to belong together which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:02.419" style="s2">original meanings of logos but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.269" end="00:26:05.639" style="s2">just it&#39;s disclosing new intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.419" end="00:26:08.759" style="s2">right but it&#39;s also a way of being you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.639" end="00:26:10.649" style="s2">know you know in Christianity made you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.759" end="00:26:12.839" style="s2">know a huge deal about this that Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.649" end="00:26:18.209" style="s2">didn&#39;t just speak the logos he was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.839" end="00:26:20.999" style="s2">logos right right um and so that logos</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.209" end="00:26:23.909" style="s2">is the name that Chris and I give to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.999" end="00:26:27.329" style="s2">that phenomena and the thing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.909" end="00:26:30.659" style="s2">it&#39;s it you know it it has connections</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.329" end="00:26:32.789" style="s2">to logic but it&#39;s not reducible to logic</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.659" end="00:26:34.859" style="s2">it also has you know potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.789" end="00:26:39.269" style="s2">connections to how we organize and make</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.859" end="00:26:44.389" style="s2">use of our resources in the best way so</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.269" end="00:26:47.099" style="s2">logos are much more like it for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.389" end="00:26:52.529" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of trying to point out a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.099" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">dynamical system of emergent distributed</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.529" end="00:26:56.699" style="s2">cognition and and its attendant emergent</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:58.979" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.699" end="00:27:01.649" style="s2">that&#39;s what logo says it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.979" end="00:27:03.389" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that one that Chris</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.649" end="00:27:05.969" style="s2">and I call it the third factor when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.389" end="00:27:08.969" style="s2">comes up and then what what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.969" end="00:27:10.889" style="s2">do right is and I see people wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.969" end="00:27:13.099" style="s2">do this naturally encircling practices</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.889" end="00:27:17.879" style="s2">other they sort of want to venerate this</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.099" end="00:27:20.249" style="s2">this because they they they sense rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.879" end="00:27:22.379" style="s2">directly I think that it&#39;s affording</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.249" end="00:27:25.499" style="s2">them you know it&#39;s affording them an</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.379" end="00:27:27.929" style="s2">access to a way of being that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.499" end="00:27:29.549" style="s2">otherwise couldn&#39;t reach by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.929" end="00:27:32.129" style="s2">so there&#39;s a often a sense of gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.549" end="00:27:34.139" style="s2">and amazement and and Wonder and like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.129" end="00:27:36.929" style="s2">eat it how did I get here and how did</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.139" end="00:27:40.199" style="s2">what was doing this and right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.929" end="00:27:42.929" style="s2">good that that veneration but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.199" end="00:27:45.329" style="s2">I want to do something more and because</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.929" end="00:27:47.269" style="s2">you you used this is what you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.329" end="00:27:49.979" style="s2">dialogues of Plato right you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.269" end="00:27:53.369" style="s2">Socrates is often the spokesperson for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.979" end="00:27:56.819" style="s2">some of the way things are turning he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.369" end="00:27:58.379" style="s2">often write remark and he&#39;ll often not</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.819" end="00:28:01.859" style="s2">only will he remark on the turn he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.379" end="00:28:06.389" style="s2">try and afford the turn in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.859" end="00:28:08.490" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s stepping back and naming</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.389" end="00:28:14.070" style="s2">not just naming the logos but</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.490" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">noticing it in a way that explicate its</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.070" end="00:28:20.300" style="s2">call on us that like sort of brings out</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:22.500" style="s2">how it&#39;s calling us and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.300" end="00:28:26.670" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do is we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">to it&#39;s it sounds kind of pretentious</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.670" end="00:28:32.340" style="s2">but we&#39;re trying to directly relate to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">that logos so that it can infer it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.340" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">afford enhanced understanding know and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:38.550" style="s2">again you&#39;re not just intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:42.350" style="s2">understanding in all the kinds of noise</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.550" end="00:28:45.660" style="s2">yeah like it affords it affords insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.350" end="00:28:47.280" style="s2">yeah yeah so Heraclitus famously said</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.660" end="00:28:49.380" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to my words listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.280" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">logos that&#39;s speaking through them yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.380" end="00:28:54.809" style="s2">right and so right and he&#39;s the great</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">godfather of the logos idea right in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.809" end="00:28:59.640" style="s2">West in fact that a sense of logos that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">as I&#39;m using it is very close to her a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.640" end="00:29:09.470" style="s2">cletus&#39;s sense of it and so right</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:14.429" style="s2">getting right sort of getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.470" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">resonant relationship not just with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.429" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">others which is what circling is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:22.050" style="s2">excellent for but with the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:26.520" style="s2">logos that&#39;s where the logos comes in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.050" end="00:29:31.110" style="s2">right and then when that process is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.520" end="00:29:33.420" style="s2">turned towards trying to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.110" end="00:29:37.920" style="s2">disclosure trying to afford enhance</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.420" end="00:29:39.240" style="s2">understanding of how we could be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.920" end="00:29:40.950" style="s2">that sounds like such an easy question</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.240" end="00:29:42.179" style="s2">that it&#39;s an easy question to state but</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.950" end="00:29:45.350" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the hardest questions to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.179" end="00:29:47.910" style="s2">live through right how we could be right</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.350" end="00:29:51.030" style="s2">and since this is like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.910" end="00:29:52.890" style="s2">revealing the divine double yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.030" end="00:29:55.380" style="s2">revealing the divine double but not only</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.890" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">our divine double our individual divine</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.380" end="00:29:59.429" style="s2">double that divine double potential for</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.059" style="s2">the group the divine double potential</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.429" end="00:30:01.740" style="s2">for the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.059" end="00:30:03.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like Corbin&#39;s notion of the eight</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.740" end="00:30:06.540" style="s2">how all beings have their eight angels</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.420" end="00:30:09.660" style="s2">right it&#39;s right it&#39;s it&#39;s that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.540" end="00:30:12.510" style="s2">it uh and so when we when we get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.660" end="00:30:14.040" style="s2">uh you know like in our last dialogue we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.510" end="00:30:16.679" style="s2">started talking about well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.040" end="00:30:18.270" style="s2">drawing us like what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.679" end="00:30:21.720" style="s2">we got this up and then we got this week</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.270" end="00:30:22.330" style="s2">we turn to a philosophical not in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.720" end="00:30:24.549" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.330" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">so like in just the conceptual analysis</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.549" end="00:30:29.140" style="s2">but in the way I&#39;m talking about here we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">turn to this discussion about beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.140" end="00:30:32.860" style="s2">then what we were all doing it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:34.870" style="s2">trying to sense the beauty and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:37.450" style="s2">like we&#39;re trying to keep coaxing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.870" end="00:30:39.730" style="s2">beauty into presence while also getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.450" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">it but yet okay can i coax it into</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.730" end="00:30:45.789" style="s2">presence and also let it shine into my</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:47.740" style="s2">understanding and we&#39;re trying and where</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.789" end="00:30:49.510" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to help each other do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.740" end="00:30:52.179" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to bring it more</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.510" end="00:30:55.090" style="s2">and more to light right and that and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.179" end="00:30:58.299" style="s2">what happens is if you notice will shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.090" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">from talking we&#39;re still talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.299" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">other but we shift from sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">concentrating on the communing and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:07.899" style="s2">all focus on the thing we focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">phenomena and how it&#39;s shining and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.899" end="00:31:12.250" style="s2">were trying to get it to shine forth</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:13.720" style="s2">more right and what and what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.250" end="00:31:15.850" style="s2">is we&#39;re doing it really because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.720" end="00:31:17.620" style="s2">don&#39;t want to lose the logos right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.850" end="00:31:19.960" style="s2">don&#39;t lose the logos and we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.620" end="00:31:21.010" style="s2">to lose the circle and we write but we</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.960" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t want to lose the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.010" end="00:31:25.090" style="s2">opportunity either because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.870" end="00:31:27.700" style="s2">possibility here that you know is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.090" end="00:31:29.830" style="s2">precious yeah and so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.700" end="00:31:34.470" style="s2">this very there&#39;s this grip there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.830" end="00:31:37.960" style="s2">almost musical finesse about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.470" end="00:31:41.860" style="s2">dialectic is trying to get up a set of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">practices and a pedagogical program so</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.860" end="00:31:47.080" style="s2">that people learn the skills the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:50.710" style="s2">sensitivities and the sensibilities in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.080" end="00:31:53.110" style="s2">order to find and flow in to do logos</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.710" end="00:31:58.389" style="s2">and into philosophy a-- in a more</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.110" end="00:32:01.690" style="s2">readily reliable fashion so dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.389" end="00:32:04.899" style="s2">has two aspects to it it has a personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.690" end="00:32:07.720" style="s2">ontological aspect in which you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.899" end="00:32:10.510" style="s2">basically it interacting with the levels</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.720" end="00:32:13.299" style="s2">of being because something about those</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.510" end="00:32:15.909" style="s2">levels has been disclosed to you right</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.299" end="00:32:18.460" style="s2">and you&#39;re also it has the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.909" end="00:32:20.850" style="s2">aspect that we&#39;ve been talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.460" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">you&#39;re trying I&#39;m always an arena yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.850" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">relations yep yep yeah yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:29.559" style="s2">in a certain sense of looking at so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.929" style="s2">looking at these transitions because</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.559" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">especially like part of my attention is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.929" end="00:32:38.050" style="s2">like okay in setting up the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">the dialectic right the biological</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.050" end="00:32:42.850" style="s2">practices right yeah it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:45.250" style="s2">what&#39;s important is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.850" end="00:32:49.030" style="s2">transition from one into the other right</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.250" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">in creating the right constraints right</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.030" end="00:32:54.010" style="s2">yes the the in what&#39;s tricky about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.290" style="s2">and I think what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.010" end="00:32:58.360" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s a delicacy to it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.290" end="00:33:01.990" style="s2">responsiveness to it there&#39;s a balance</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.360" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">it invokes all of this all of this cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.990" end="00:33:09.040" style="s2">machinery right here yes that is very</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:11.860" style="s2">involved yet like stands back and stands</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.040" end="00:33:14.170" style="s2">forward and then names and is related</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:19.180" style="s2">and up and there&#39;s all these processes</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.170" end="00:33:20.890" style="s2">that are going on yes the but in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.180" end="00:33:24.280" style="s2">this element to which is where I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.890" end="00:33:27.070" style="s2">the biological fire right the symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.280" end="00:33:29.830" style="s2">the of the fire really comes back well</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.070" end="00:33:30.820" style="s2">to by the way yeah absolutely that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.830" end="00:33:32.920" style="s2">I really want to good because they think</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.820" end="00:33:35.020" style="s2">on some level that&#39;s that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.920" end="00:33:38.530" style="s2">guiding symbol that has been speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.020" end="00:33:41.080" style="s2">me in in all this coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.530" end="00:33:44.590" style="s2">that there&#39;s this element about a fire</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.080" end="00:33:47.470" style="s2">right which is similar to cut like like</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.590" end="00:33:49.330" style="s2">at the garden metaphor right where where</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.470" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">you can you can get all the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">in right you can you know you you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.980" style="s2">get you can gather the right wood you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:33:59.080" style="s2">can you can you could stoke the flame</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.980" end="00:34:01.660" style="s2">you can but there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.080" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">place where it&#39;s beyond you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.660" end="00:34:07.660" style="s2">your direct doing yeah at the stage but</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:12.010" style="s2">then it almost by grace by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.660" end="00:34:14.830" style="s2">itself it becomes more than very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.010" end="00:34:17.980" style="s2">very much and I think and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.830" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">also pertinent given the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.980" end="00:34:23.560" style="s2">fire were I was suggesting to you I</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:25.419" style="s2">think in that last dialogue that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.560" end="00:34:28.990" style="s2">know we&#39;re engaging in virtual campfires</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.419" end="00:34:30.610" style="s2">now are staring at a fire that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.990" end="00:34:32.950" style="s2">communal that we put together and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.610" end="00:34:36.190" style="s2">we&#39;re now sharing and that is having an</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.950" end="00:34:38.169" style="s2">impact on us drawing us out from</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.190" end="00:34:40.900" style="s2">ourselves while also drawing us deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.169" end="00:34:43.360" style="s2">into ourselves like yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.900" end="00:34:45.370" style="s2">fire metaphor is also a wonderful symbol</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.360" end="00:34:48.160" style="s2">precisely because of the way to evoke</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.370" end="00:34:49.130" style="s2">the shared campfire which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.160" end="00:34:51.530" style="s2">being involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.130" end="00:34:54.260" style="s2">in some ways by the way this medium is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:57.140" style="s2">if is affecting us and so I think there</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.260" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">it I mean I was sort of hi to Gary in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.140" end="00:35:00.500" style="s2">here but I think maybe Tillich and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:03.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a there there there&#39;s a coming</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:05.660" style="s2">together a Kairos between the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.380" end="00:35:08.840" style="s2">phenomenological affordances of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.660" end="00:35:11.480" style="s2">medium what it exams and the symbols</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.840" end="00:35:15.230" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about here the fire</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.480" end="00:35:17.570" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s this thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.230" end="00:35:19.820" style="s2">keep doing with their hands kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.570" end="00:35:24.620" style="s2">gathering it has this quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.820" end="00:35:29.090" style="s2">gathering but also emergence yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.620" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">yes yes very much having a life of its</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.090" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">own and so you can&#39;t like if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.859" end="00:35:44.590" style="s2">so you have to you have to accept the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.630" end="00:35:47.950" style="s2">fact that the fire is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.590" end="00:35:50.170" style="s2">shifting constantly moving precisely</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.950" end="00:35:53.350" style="s2">because it has a life of its own if it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.170" end="00:35:56.680" style="s2">has because it&#39;s a logos and and not</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.350" end="00:35:58.510" style="s2">just a machine right you have to let it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.680" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">let it have a life of its own this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.510" end="00:36:02.950" style="s2">why Jordan and I&#39;ve been talking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">about Socratic faith this sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:08.380" style="s2">know being able to maintain a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:11.109" style="s2">of contact and then flow and follow with</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.380" end="00:36:15.090" style="s2">something rather than having any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.109" end="00:36:19.740" style="s2">closure on to certainty yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.090" end="00:36:23.320" style="s2">yeah yeah faith in this very active way</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.740" end="00:36:26.080" style="s2">yes I mean like when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.320" end="00:36:29.830" style="s2">letting it&#39;s not just a passivity it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.080" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">proactive allowing letting it has me</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.830" end="00:36:35.500" style="s2">think about glass tonight right letting</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:37.240" style="s2">be yep let it be yet there&#39;s an energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.500" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">there&#39;s an energy of breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.240" end="00:36:41.560" style="s2">there&#39;s an energy of inspiration right</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.550" end="00:36:43.630" style="s2">it&#39;s all for those one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.560" end="00:36:44.890" style="s2">that you you talked about in one of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.630" end="00:36:48.490" style="s2">conversations too that I&#39;ve thought a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.890" end="00:36:50.170" style="s2">lot about like that what&#39;s what was</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.490" end="00:36:52.660" style="s2">missing for you and some heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.170" end="00:36:54.760" style="s2">later work was it was like lots about</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.660" end="00:36:57.160" style="s2">glass and height letting be but what was</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.760" end="00:36:59.020" style="s2">missing was another German you were</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.160" end="00:37:00.609" style="s2">doing right from meister eckhart</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.020" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">breakthrough breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.609" end="00:37:05.980" style="s2">yeah the breakthrough yeah so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:07.570" style="s2">need both believes and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.980" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">breakthrough I like what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.570" end="00:37:11.350" style="s2">earlier like you you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">together they the right set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.350" end="00:37:16.450" style="s2">constraints of virtual engine and and at</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:18.340" style="s2">that overlaps with having cultivated the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.450" end="00:37:20.530" style="s2">resonant and appropriate virtues in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.340" end="00:37:22.930" style="s2">oneself might not just moral virtues but</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.530" end="00:37:27.100" style="s2">cognitive virtues so that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.930" end="00:37:29.170" style="s2">you are rezulin resonantly aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.100" end="00:37:31.660" style="s2">the conditions all right because if</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.170" end="00:37:33.580" style="s2">you&#39;re not properly aligned like so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.660" end="00:37:35.410" style="s2">can get all the firewood together right</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.580" end="00:37:37.030" style="s2">but if you&#39;re not properly following the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.410" end="00:37:39.670" style="s2">grain of the wood and paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.030" end="00:37:41.980" style="s2">to the wind and noticing the lay of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.670" end="00:37:43.720" style="s2">land and feeling the wetness of the wood</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.980" end="00:37:45.400" style="s2">you can get it all together and you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.720" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">use your magic sort of formula and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.400" end="00:37:50.289" style="s2">nothing happens but right if right if</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:53.439" style="s2">you&#39;re if you write if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.289" end="00:37:55.390" style="s2">finessing and finding the balance of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.439" end="00:37:56.949" style="s2">conditions oh no these conditions have</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.390" end="00:37:58.509" style="s2">to be nudged this way this constraint</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.949" end="00:38:02.019" style="s2">has to be nudged this way these have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.509" end="00:38:05.049" style="s2">be nudged and now here now</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.019" end="00:38:07.869" style="s2">this virtual engine is possible for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.049" end="00:38:09.429" style="s2">and therefore a fire as possible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.869" end="00:38:12.009" style="s2">very much what it&#39;s like for deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.429" end="00:38:14.019" style="s2">- I think if there&#39;s there&#39;s dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.009" end="00:38:15.249" style="s2">therefore has two sets of practices two</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.019" end="00:38:17.140" style="s2">kinds of practices</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.249" end="00:38:21.910" style="s2">there&#39;s the practices that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.140" end="00:38:24.150" style="s2">to try and engender the do logos but</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.910" end="00:38:26.499" style="s2">there&#39;s also all of the preparatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.150" end="00:38:29.289" style="s2">practices the s thesis the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.499" end="00:38:30.579" style="s2">exercises that purify I don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.289" end="00:38:32.289" style="s2">word but that&#39;s you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.579" end="00:38:34.989" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition basically what</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.289" end="00:38:36.669" style="s2">they do is I like Plutonians model of if</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.989" end="00:38:39.189" style="s2">you&#39;re carving your inner statute they</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.669" end="00:38:41.499" style="s2">shape you they shape you and make you</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.189" end="00:38:44.289" style="s2">fossil make it possible for you to enter</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.499" end="00:38:45.939" style="s2">into these kinds of practices so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.289" end="00:38:46.839" style="s2">of there being this really important</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.939" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.839" end="00:38:52.239" style="s2">the ecologies of the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:55.390" style="s2">practices should shape you for via logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.239" end="00:38:57.549" style="s2">alright and so part of what the part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.390" end="00:38:59.829" style="s2">what the dialectic does is it help right</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.549" end="00:39:03.159" style="s2">it helps draw from all the ecologies and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.829" end="00:39:05.349" style="s2">draw them up to shape you for Dia logos</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.159" end="00:39:07.089" style="s2">but what dialectic does is also it takes</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.349" end="00:39:10.689" style="s2">the do logos and then goes back and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.089" end="00:39:13.989" style="s2">shapes and Shepherds the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.689" end="00:39:16.719" style="s2">practices that&#39;s why it&#39;s indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.989" end="00:39:19.479" style="s2">on an individual level and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.719" end="00:39:22.959" style="s2">of the things that you know this is part</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.479" end="00:39:27.759" style="s2">of one of the contentions around I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.959" end="00:39:30.099" style="s2">even say a defense and a scorn for what</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.759" end="00:39:32.949" style="s2">went what comes up for people oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.099" end="00:39:35.799" style="s2">with philosophy right yeah which is is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.949" end="00:39:39.209" style="s2">actually what we&#39;re this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.799" end="00:39:42.279" style="s2">really like in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.209" end="00:39:44.619" style="s2">deconstructing or revealing is is not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.279" end="00:39:46.929" style="s2">proper attitude right which is in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.619" end="00:39:50.679" style="s2">of the and a lot of like the personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.929" end="00:39:53.849" style="s2">growth world or like the stall</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.679" end="00:39:56.409" style="s2">processing world and the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.849" end="00:39:58.779" style="s2">that whole world there&#39;s almost like in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.409" end="00:40:01.179" style="s2">a sense of this that like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.779" end="00:40:02.019" style="s2">thing that you could be told is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.179" end="00:40:03.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in your head</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.019" end="00:40:05.020" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.640" end="00:40:08.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of quality where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.020" end="00:40:11.020" style="s2">almost like to be virtuous is to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.170" end="00:40:14.860" style="s2">shunning of anything cognitive right</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.020" end="00:40:16.810" style="s2">yeah because I think what what what what</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.860" end="00:40:19.540" style="s2">we&#39;re addressing is that is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.810" end="00:40:21.400" style="s2">been a split that&#39;s going on I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.540" end="00:40:23.950" style="s2">there&#39;s I mean we could talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.400" end="00:40:28.390" style="s2">the history of that but like I would say</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.950" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">in the in in the world of personal</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.390" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">growth today it&#39;s generally said that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:34.840" style="s2">like the whole thing is about getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:37.600" style="s2">into your body and getting out of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.840" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">head yeah and and I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.600" end="00:40:42.970" style="s2">talking about is precisely the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:45.970" style="s2">that brings both of them together and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.970" end="00:40:48.630" style="s2">and then beyond themselves much very</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.970" end="00:40:51.550" style="s2">much very much that&#39;s why I keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.630" end="00:40:55.690" style="s2">you know I&#39;m using rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.550" end="00:40:59.860" style="s2">knowing in these much that involve being</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.690" end="00:41:08.950" style="s2">embodied embedded enacted right all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.860" end="00:41:11.640" style="s2">that for ease right so extend it to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.950" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">extended cognition is paramount</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.640" end="00:41:16.600" style="s2">encircling indecision one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:21.490" style="s2">that you said you said after one of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.600" end="00:41:24.010" style="s2">diet our art our dialog assesses is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.490" end="00:41:28.060" style="s2">you referred to what would happen after</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.010" end="00:41:29.560" style="s2">a dialog with Socrates right where where</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.060" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">you start off with some that he starts</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.560" end="00:41:35.490" style="s2">off with some question right like what</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">is some virtue and at the end of it like</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.490" end="00:41:40.080" style="s2">no one there&#39;s no clear answer that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.170" end="00:41:43.240" style="s2">question nothing has been solved yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.080" end="00:41:45.610" style="s2">people that they speak like their vision</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.240" end="00:41:47.530" style="s2">is more clear and I want to travel</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.610" end="00:41:50.050" style="s2">further with Socrates or at least they</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.530" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">want their kids to study with Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.050" end="00:41:57.730" style="s2">that&#39;s how dialogues often end right yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:59.860" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense of people well</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.730" end="00:42:04.210" style="s2">getting this Socratic faith this sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.860" end="00:42:07.300" style="s2">of coming into coming into immersion</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.210" end="00:42:11.730" style="s2">with the logos and seeing that the logos</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.300" end="00:42:14.830" style="s2">has a trajectory and it&#39;s offering you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.730" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">the serious play and the way I use that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.830" end="00:42:20.530" style="s2">the serious play</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:21.940" style="s2">of another way of being its so I talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.530" end="00:42:24.609" style="s2">about the fact you know in other places</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.940" end="00:42:26.380" style="s2">that you know and use people can</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.609" end="00:42:27.640" style="s2">countering this and you know when they</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.380" end="00:42:30.460" style="s2">when they&#39;re stuck and they in need of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.640" end="00:42:33.010" style="s2">therapy right they don&#39;t know how to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.460" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">from who I am now in this world to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.010" end="00:42:37.570" style="s2">person there in that world because that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:39.070" style="s2">world is right it&#39;s not you can&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.570" end="00:42:41.830" style="s2">of infer your way to it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.070" end="00:42:43.180" style="s2">inferential II accessible because you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.830" end="00:42:44.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it&#39;s gonna be like until</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.180" end="00:42:46.150" style="s2">you&#39;re there if you don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.680" end="00:42:49.720" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be until you&#39;re there right</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.150" end="00:42:52.599" style="s2">so how and what I say well you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.720" end="00:42:55.330" style="s2">you know le Paul and Agnes Keller talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.599" end="00:42:57.730" style="s2">about this in various ways well what do</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.330" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">people do well what we&#39;ve done is we try</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.730" end="00:43:03.910" style="s2">to create symbolic places liminal places</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">where we can keep touch with who we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.910" end="00:43:09.190" style="s2">now but we can come into contact with</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.690" end="00:45:41.430" style="s2">on the personal transformational end of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.530" end="00:45:44.619" style="s2">things right one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.430" end="00:45:47.560" style="s2">philosophy ax and dial logos is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.619" end="00:45:49.330" style="s2">attractive is that it it is it what it</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.560" end="00:45:51.070" style="s2">seems to do and I and I&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.330" end="00:45:52.990" style="s2">recent examples of working with people</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.070" end="00:45:57.790" style="s2">of watching this happen in a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.990" end="00:45:58.570" style="s2">concrete way it&#39;s very needing to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.790" end="00:46:01.089" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.570" end="00:46:02.680" style="s2">what afforded that right and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.089" end="00:46:05.080" style="s2">much what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.680" end="00:46:07.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of where you know we may</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.080" end="00:46:09.490" style="s2">start off like oftentimes people come to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.420" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">me in my personal practice right in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.490" end="00:46:14.380" style="s2">my my one-on-one working with people</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:16.900" style="s2">they&#39;re very specific problems right</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.380" end="00:46:18.970" style="s2">that they want to solve right and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.900" end="00:46:22.420" style="s2">we&#39;ll start entering into that proc but</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.970" end="00:46:25.630" style="s2">that yep that problem but that problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.420" end="00:46:27.420" style="s2">opens up to all these things where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.630" end="00:46:30.310" style="s2">actually spend most of our time</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.420" end="00:46:33.700" style="s2">dialoguing around all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.310" end="00:46:36.730" style="s2">open up and then somewhere along the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.700" end="00:46:38.890" style="s2">line they show up and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.730" end="00:46:41.080" style="s2">that problem anymore but they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.890" end="00:46:43.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that they&#39;ve ya don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.080" end="00:46:47.140" style="s2">I solved the problem right</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.690" end="00:46:51.190" style="s2">in fact the way that they what they in</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.140" end="00:46:54.490" style="s2">fact the way that they organized the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.190" end="00:46:57.060" style="s2">problem when they first came right it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.490" end="00:46:58.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even look like the same thing no</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.060" end="00:47:00.550" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.210" end="00:47:02.829" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is I was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.550" end="00:47:04.359" style="s2">recently I was like okay so what was the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.829" end="00:47:07.930" style="s2">difference that made that difference cuz</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.359" end="00:47:09.690" style="s2">we awoke inside of it right but not</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.930" end="00:47:13.030" style="s2">being able to get out of bed to like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.690" end="00:47:14.940" style="s2">running groups with people and taking</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.030" end="00:47:17.230" style="s2">the leadership in her community and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">like she&#39;s no longer depressed and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.230" end="00:47:22.210" style="s2">sleeping and and she got we kind of woke</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:25.230" style="s2">up to that and I was like what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.210" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">like what was it she&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.230" end="00:47:33.700" style="s2">like I think what it was is you in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:35.260" style="s2">experience I got deeply seen and I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.700" end="00:47:36.970" style="s2">like okay so let&#39;s pause there cuz I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.260" end="00:47:38.470" style="s2">heard that a lot this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.970" end="00:47:40.540" style="s2">being deeply seen but when we looked</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.470" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">into it was fascinating she&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.540" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">you know when I think about our</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:48.910" style="s2">conversations when I picture you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:51.430" style="s2">right here like I don&#39;t picture you over</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.910" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">there I picture you right here and I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.430" end="00:47:56.410" style="s2">like so let&#39;s picture that and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:59.710" style="s2">is it that like I&#39;m are we face to face</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.410" end="00:48:02.560" style="s2">she&#39;s like no actually it&#39;s not here</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.710" end="00:48:04.869" style="s2">it&#39;s here and I&#39;m like am I looking am i</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.560" end="00:48:09.790" style="s2">looking at you or am like no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.869" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">actually looking somewhere here now is</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.790" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">and what was interesting to me is I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:16.030" style="s2">think that this is kind of getting I</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:17.829" style="s2">think that exemplifies a bit of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.030" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about very much I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.829" end="00:48:24.220" style="s2">that&#39;s brilliant I think that&#39;s it that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:27.160" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s not it it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.220" end="00:48:28.990" style="s2">it&#39;s about so almost like a stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.160" end="00:48:31.450" style="s2">thing between people you know how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.990" end="00:48:32.890" style="s2">two of eyes right they learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.450" end="00:48:34.690" style="s2">integrate so you get a depth of vision</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.890" end="00:48:37.030" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t have before</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.690" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">I think what happens in this process is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.030" end="00:48:42.010" style="s2">that I think one of the things the logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.490" end="00:48:44.470" style="s2">does is it gathers perspectives so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.010" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">they do that you know and the tightness</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.470" end="00:48:49.180" style="s2">even has this metaphor of of all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:50.680" style="s2">faces that come to be inward facing to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.180" end="00:48:52.540" style="s2">the same center and we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.680" end="00:48:54.970" style="s2">campfire again and then you get that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.540" end="00:48:56.710" style="s2">fusion you get that fusion you get to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.970" end="00:48:57.400" style="s2">sort of sense of multi-dimensional depth</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.710" end="00:48:58.780" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.400" end="00:49:01.240" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right I think what</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.780" end="00:49:03.670" style="s2">happens but I think what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.240" end="00:49:05.020" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it via logos as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.670" end="00:49:06.900" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing which is a more I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.020" end="00:49:09.880" style="s2">guess therapeutic context if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:11.290" style="s2">something adjectives right I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.880" end="00:49:13.840" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.290" end="00:49:14.290" style="s2">coming beside each of us is not you or</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.840" end="00:49:17.590" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.290" end="00:49:19.450" style="s2">it&#39;s the logos yeah right yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.590" end="00:49:24.490" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to we&#39;re starting to take</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.450" end="00:49:26.950" style="s2">the perspective of logos as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.490" end="00:49:29.350" style="s2">John&#39;s perspective or guy&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.950" end="00:49:30.550" style="s2">or Jordans perspective we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.350" end="00:49:32.080" style="s2">when the circling we&#39;re taking each</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.550" end="00:49:33.580" style="s2">other&#39;s perspectives I&#39;m sure but what</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.080" end="00:49:35.620" style="s2">happens when you get that next</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.580" end="00:49:37.270" style="s2">transition when that third factor of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.620" end="00:49:39.880" style="s2">yours is your trunk you&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.270" end="00:49:41.620" style="s2">see things from the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.880" end="00:49:43.420" style="s2">logos and you&#39;re starting to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.620" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">it it&#39;s this way it&#39;s as we think is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.420" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">internalize it but it&#39;s coming from us</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:48.220" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:50.440" style="s2">we&#39;re but well it&#39;s like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.220" end="00:49:52.270" style="s2">we put all the wood together it makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.440" end="00:49:54.760" style="s2">the fire and then only then does the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.270" end="00:49:56.890" style="s2">heat and the light come back to us right</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.760" end="00:49:59.170" style="s2">and then it changes us Foucault talks</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.890" end="00:50:01.180" style="s2">about this rebound effect that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.170" end="00:50:04.840" style="s2">looking for and I think what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.180" end="00:50:07.180" style="s2">happens is this is this is I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.840" end="00:50:10.870" style="s2">to internalize the logos perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.180" end="00:50:12.310" style="s2">right and and and and that is now</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.870" end="00:50:16.090" style="s2">becoming internalized and I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.310" end="00:50:17.950" style="s2">to be able to see more deeply from from</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.090" end="00:50:21.040" style="s2">that because it&#39;s now it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.950" end="00:50:23.110" style="s2">active with me it you know I think what</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.040" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">Cynthia is it at the end of the Phaedrus</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.110" end="00:50:29.770" style="s2">I can&#39;t or which one is it where</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:31.990" style="s2">Socrates is the the prayer to pan at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.770" end="00:50:34.030" style="s2">end he said you know and in the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.990" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">the gods were always here they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.030" end="00:50:38.830" style="s2">always here and they were always drawing</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:41.710" style="s2">us through this dialogue and he asked</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.830" end="00:50:44.410" style="s2">any a basically a span to make him only</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.710" end="00:50:45.640" style="s2">desire you know that the good within is</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.410" end="00:50:47.020" style="s2">equal to the good without or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.640" end="00:50:52.210" style="s2">like that the beauty within the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.020" end="00:50:55.840" style="s2">without and III think that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.210" end="00:50:58.150" style="s2">much what&#39;s going on there is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.840" end="00:51:02.020" style="s2">recognition of what has been with us all</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.150" end="00:51:03.910" style="s2">the way through is that this logos that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.020" end="00:51:05.890" style="s2">and I like this like this idea where</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.910" end="00:51:09.970" style="s2">we&#39;re crafting together if it comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.890" end="00:51:10.870" style="s2">beside me so I start to get this new you</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.970" end="00:51:13.450" style="s2">know stereoscope</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.870" end="00:51:15.850" style="s2">ontological depth perception as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.450" end="00:51:18.280" style="s2">to visual depth perception in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.850" end="00:51:22.300" style="s2">interesting is is this sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.280" end="00:51:24.670" style="s2">this sense of being peers yes when I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.300" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">really thought there&#39;s that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.670" end="00:51:28.930" style="s2">like where because there really is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:31.600" style="s2">experience it&#39;s funny I guess there is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.930" end="00:51:34.810" style="s2">therapeutic context but it that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.600" end="00:51:39.100" style="s2">experience like it&#39;s literally like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.810" end="00:51:41.710" style="s2">I feel we become peers and we stand in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.100" end="00:51:43.750" style="s2">the simplex in what in the way that she</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.710" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">described it it was she said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.750" end="00:51:49.330" style="s2">combination of like you&#39;re looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:52.600" style="s2">but then we look out together</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.330" end="00:51:54.670" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s yeah and it really is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.600" end="00:51:58.990" style="s2">experience of and I think this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.670" end="00:52:02.590" style="s2">the things that circling in practicing</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.990" end="00:52:07.060" style="s2">circling has drawn in so many senses</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.590" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">have showed me me like to gathered icing</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.060" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">stock on some level because that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:14.560" style="s2">always noticed that this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:17.560" style="s2">deeply understanding somebody deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.560" end="00:52:19.960" style="s2">getting somebody deeply into their world</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.560" end="00:52:24.040" style="s2">one it leads to these conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.960" end="00:52:26.320" style="s2">go beyond just the did to determine</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.040" end="00:52:28.750" style="s2">itself or something in it light</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.320" end="00:52:32.980" style="s2">something up but I understand you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.750" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">then I walk away from that with knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.980" end="00:52:38.020" style="s2">myself somehow better more articulated</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:40.450" style="s2">because we know ourselves in action we</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.020" end="00:52:43.480" style="s2">know ourselves envisioning it&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.450" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not somewhat what we see I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.480" end="00:52:48.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s how we&#39;re seeing yes right</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:51.100" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.030" end="00:52:54.910" style="s2">Platonic vision right even use this word</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.100" end="00:52:58.270" style="s2">still right it&#39;s right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.910" end="00:53:00.610" style="s2">seeing that brings into remembrance our</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.270" end="00:53:02.920" style="s2">kinship to the divine it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.610" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">skiing it&#39;s not so much what we see is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.920" end="00:53:08.320" style="s2">that in as we see we realize oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:13.330" style="s2">a deep participatory relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.320" end="00:53:15.640" style="s2">between me right and the divine and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.330" end="00:53:18.340" style="s2">what I think that means within the deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:21.090" style="s2">logos it&#39;s like you said we get we get</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.340" end="00:53:21.090" style="s2">this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.510" end="00:53:26.980" style="s2">when we get that turning and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.610" end="00:53:28.450" style="s2">getting the new way of seeing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.980" end="00:53:31.390" style="s2">afforded by the logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.450" end="00:53:33.790" style="s2">we then sense our deep kinship to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.390" end="00:53:35.590" style="s2">logos that&#39;s what I need that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.790" end="00:53:38.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the faith I&#39;m talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.590" end="00:53:40.270" style="s2">sense of affinity to the logos right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.380" end="00:53:42.340" style="s2">we go wait wait that&#39;s the anamnesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.270" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the remembering that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.340" end="00:53:48.580" style="s2">what I really am I&#39;m like the logos</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.580" end="00:53:55.390" style="s2">gives me the the true taste the serious</p>

<p begin="00:53:57.640" end="00:54:03.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a living challenge to me right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.460" end="00:54:06.730" style="s2">because wait wait I&#39;m akin to this I</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.390" end="00:54:08.200" style="s2">participate in it I that&#39;s that&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.720" end="00:57:55.480" style="s2">practicable question is well what what</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.750" end="00:57:58.540" style="s2">skills and virtues and sensibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.480" end="00:58:02.200" style="s2">sensitivities and you know and virtue a</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.099" end="00:58:16.590" style="s2">they can come and experience this it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.119" end="00:58:19.090" style="s2">mean I I was I was remembering is he the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.590" end="00:58:24.670" style="s2">because of my upbringing the Bible is in</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.090" end="00:58:25.930" style="s2">me deeper then and maybe my language but</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.670" end="00:58:28.109" style="s2">I was remembering there&#39;s a passage</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.930" end="00:58:31.690" style="s2">where I can&#39;t remember I think it&#39;s Paul</p>

<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:42.820" style="s2">you like right right and it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:45.099" style="s2">of Eckhart&#39;s thing you know the the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.820" end="00:58:48.460" style="s2">eye by which we see God is the eye by</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.099" end="00:58:50.020" style="s2">which he sees me there&#39;s there all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.460" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">now what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;m seeing all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.020" end="00:58:54.099" style="s2">these traditions were trying to point to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:56.560" style="s2">this place where we get well the logos</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.099" end="00:58:59.830" style="s2">is beside or even within me right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.560" end="00:59:00.250" style="s2">yet it&#39;s affording me to see in a new</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.830" end="00:59:03.609" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.250" end="00:59:05.320" style="s2">yeah which is a realization of my</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.609" end="00:59:09.369" style="s2">kinship to the logos and where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.320" end="00:59:11.530" style="s2">going yeah that&#39;s a sense of faith I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.369" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">been trying to get my finger on ya the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.530" end="00:59:18.609" style="s2">kinship again goes and we&#39;re going then</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:22.359" style="s2">that kinship that remembering that sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.609" end="00:59:24.580" style="s2">of that that discovering what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.359" end="00:59:26.650" style="s2">we&#39;ve been walking with the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.580" end="00:59:31.420" style="s2">just kind of a friend that was there</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.650" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">that was dying yeah yeah it in glimpsing</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.420" end="00:59:37.690" style="s2">it and then wanting it all becomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:39.790" style="s2">present like is there&#39;s no if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.690" end="00:59:44.200" style="s2">ecstatic temporality I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.790" end="00:59:45.849" style="s2">is yeah well it it definitely is and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.200" end="00:59:47.349" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.849" end="00:59:49.780" style="s2">thought about that that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.349" end="00:59:52.210" style="s2">until it for a long time if he talks</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.780" end="00:59:53.950" style="s2">about the problem with autonomy is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.210" end="00:59:56.710" style="s2">closes you in that&#39;s the content</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.950" end="00:59:59.710" style="s2">Cartesian problem and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.710" end="01:00:01.780" style="s2">heteronomy is its demonic its disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.710" end="01:00:03.310" style="s2">its destructive of the person and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.780" end="01:00:05.770" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get is you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.310" end="01:00:10.030" style="s2">get the fionna me right that is trans</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.770" end="01:00:12.040" style="s2">jet it you you use and this is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.030" end="01:00:14.470" style="s2">about the beautiful it&#39;s one Frankfurt</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.040" end="01:00:17.020" style="s2">talks about its he calls it a voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.470" end="01:00:19.390" style="s2">necessity kind of thing right with where</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.020" end="01:00:21.550" style="s2">we like we&#39;re struck and recalled what</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.390" end="01:00:22.870" style="s2">we go yeah but that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.550" end="01:00:26.890" style="s2">what I&#39;ve always wanted I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.870" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">right um kind of thing mmm-hmm I had you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.890" end="01:00:32.700" style="s2">thought about that but this is a crucial</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:37.030" style="s2">feature of of the state of via logos</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.700" end="01:00:39.430" style="s2">that place where people yeah are in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.030" end="01:00:42.580" style="s2">they&#39;re either autonomous nor</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.430" end="01:00:45.130" style="s2">heteronomous right it&#39;s the animus and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.580" end="01:00:48.370" style="s2">it&#39;s because they&#39;ve got that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.130" end="01:00:51.610" style="s2">got that continuity of contact so that</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.370" end="01:00:53.470" style="s2">that that sense of its within and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.610" end="01:00:56.560" style="s2">without they&#39;re calling to each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.470" end="01:00:57.940" style="s2">but that&#39;s there&#39;s a deep affinity sorry</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.560" end="01:01:02.440" style="s2">I keep repeating this because I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.940" end="01:01:03.820" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to write I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.440" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about it&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.820" end="01:01:09.160" style="s2">right yeah calling ended present at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">same time it&#39;s here yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.160" end="01:01:12.850" style="s2">we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re taught it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:14.860" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.850" end="01:01:17.620" style="s2">it shine forth so that we could actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.860" end="01:01:19.480" style="s2">see more deeply into it right and what</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.620" end="01:01:21.790" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the fear the furia</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.480" end="01:01:24.850" style="s2">theorizing right and this is how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.790" end="01:01:28.510" style="s2">different from just theorizing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.850" end="01:01:31.420" style="s2">right it isn&#39;t this is only theorizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.510" end="01:01:35.020" style="s2">that is coupled to the ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.420" end="01:01:37.960" style="s2">transformation of thoria now this brings</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.020" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">me back to the the last like towards the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.960" end="01:01:41.320" style="s2">end for the last question I think that I</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.180" end="01:01:49.750" style="s2">struck me I didn&#39;t quite exactly know</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.890" end="01:01:53.340" style="s2">why it struck me but it is stuck in</p>

<p begin="01:07:12.020" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">want to come to inhabit or live in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:19.160" style="s2">as much as possible but that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:07:24.230" end="01:07:29.630" style="s2">as a complimentary since you&#39;re a living</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.480" end="01:07:32.180" style="s2">symbol of that of that world disclosure</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.630" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">and of the also up of potential</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.180" end="01:07:37.730" style="s2">disclosure of kinds of identity that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:40.910" style="s2">find beautiful and therefore right there</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.730" end="01:07:44.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s but it&#39;s inextricably bound up</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.910" end="01:07:47.270" style="s2">with you right in this sense of just as</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.120" end="01:07:49.850" style="s2">funny I just got this experience of like</p>

<p begin="01:07:49.850" end="01:07:55.190" style="s2">that when someone dies right like and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.460" end="01:07:57.620" style="s2">when a friend from this percent like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.190" end="01:08:00.020" style="s2">world disclosing friend in which you</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.620" end="01:08:04.130" style="s2">were on to in all the ways that you just</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.020" end="01:08:07.550" style="s2">said would certainly they die what one</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.130" end="01:08:09.230" style="s2">goes into grief and in Carragher talks</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.550" end="01:08:10.760" style="s2">about this not directly but I think this</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.230" end="01:08:13.370" style="s2">is what he&#39;s talking about right when he</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.760" end="01:08:15.830" style="s2">talks about well what are what are</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.370" end="01:08:18.830" style="s2">things that like can transform one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.830" end="01:08:20.510" style="s2">identity through and through and and he</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.830" end="01:08:22.270" style="s2">talks about unconditional commitment but</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.510" end="01:08:24.710" style="s2">I think in a certain sense the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.270" end="01:08:29.540" style="s2">unconditional commitment is enacted at</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.710" end="01:08:31.940" style="s2">friendship and so what will being a what</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.540" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">befriending you having a friend in this</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.940" end="01:08:38.330" style="s2">sense means is that I&#39;m opening myself</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:42.320" style="s2">up to you die yes and I&#39;m opening myself</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.330" end="01:08:45.140" style="s2">up to you being a world disclosure in</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.320" end="01:08:46.609" style="s2">which I grieve and if you let go into</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.140" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">that grief and go through it fully</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.609" end="01:08:50.900" style="s2">I mean people experience that all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:52.520" style="s2">time we&#39;re like then they lose a loved</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.900" end="01:08:56.330" style="s2">one or a child or something</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.520" end="01:08:57.500" style="s2">and it is it completely changes all</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.330" end="01:08:58.609" style="s2">their meaning horizons</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.500" end="01:09:01.460" style="s2">everything that he gave them meeting</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.609" end="01:09:04.220" style="s2">right and then if they can go through it</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.460" end="01:09:05.990" style="s2">right it&#39;s almost like going through the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.220" end="01:09:08.450" style="s2">eye the needle in a whole new world</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.990" end="01:09:10.520" style="s2">opens up in an identity after that so</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.450" end="01:09:12.259" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of element where I</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.520" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">think this is one of the things is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.259" end="01:09:18.350" style="s2">vulnerable why the operability intimacy</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:20.299" style="s2">friendship and all these things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.350" end="01:09:22.040" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it&#39;s basically if I</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.299" end="01:09:24.650" style="s2">befriend you I basically am saying that</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.040" end="01:09:28.370" style="s2">like if you die I will forever be</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.650" end="01:09:31.279" style="s2">different yes you are doing that</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.370" end="01:09:33.319" style="s2">together I mean I in fact in my</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.279" end="01:09:37.009" style="s2">experience as a brief what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.319" end="01:09:40.759" style="s2">difficult about the grief is actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.009" end="01:09:44.810" style="s2">feeling that world that was accessible</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.759" end="01:09:47.720" style="s2">through that person slipping away you</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.810" end="01:09:49.970" style="s2">know so I I find I grieve and I hope</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.720" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">this is understood as a compliment to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.970" end="01:09:58.070" style="s2">the but I grieve the the person&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.120" end="01:10:00.530" style="s2">so much and that&#39;s why many people I</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.070" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">mean the some of the wisest advice I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.530" end="01:10:04.550" style="s2">ever given in my being when I had</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:06.260" style="s2">encountered grief for the very you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.550" end="01:10:08.060" style="s2">the most profound initial time in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.260" end="01:10:10.100" style="s2">life and he had said to me he said like</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.060" end="01:10:11.780" style="s2">he said there&#39;s nothing you can do about</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.100" end="01:10:15.890" style="s2">grief other than grow into a different</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.780" end="01:10:17.330" style="s2">kind of person there&#39;s nothing else I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.890" end="01:10:18.980" style="s2">avoid it you try to drown it your</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.330" end="01:10:21.020" style="s2">friends feed it there&#39;s nothing you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.980" end="01:10:24.950" style="s2">do except you have to grow into another</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.020" end="01:10:30.290" style="s2">kind of person because right that person</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.950" end="01:10:32.030" style="s2">is so interwoven with your world you you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.290" end="01:10:33.860" style="s2">have to go through you have to change</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.030" end="01:10:36.710" style="s2">the whole agent arena relationship that</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.860" end="01:10:39.020" style="s2">is the only response and then he said</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.710" end="01:10:42.500" style="s2">something right after that which was the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.020" end="01:10:45.260" style="s2">second most wisest thing you know he</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.500" end="01:10:47.060" style="s2">said and he said I would I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.260" end="01:10:51.770" style="s2">be in relationship to somebody who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:55.010" end="01:10:58.970" style="s2">through like grieving are layers of life</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.570" end="01:11:01.790" style="s2">right now right because if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.970" end="01:11:03.380" style="s2">experienced that profound grief and this</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.790" end="01:11:04.910" style="s2">is probably you know part of what Plato</p>

<p begin="01:11:08.810" end="01:11:12.890" style="s2">that maybe this is Kirk regards point</p>

<p begin="01:14:25.679" end="01:14:29.820" style="s2">I was saying the way iris Murdoch&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.860" end="01:14:51.330" style="s2">be a human being so it&#39;s like that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.310" end="01:14:54.449" style="s2">sense of reflecting on what the</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.940" end="01:15:25.380" style="s2">in the symposium where I think it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.760" end="01:15:27.330" style="s2">Socrates is talking about also piety is</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.380" end="01:15:29.700" style="s2">how the best way</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.330" end="01:15:32.250" style="s2">to know yourself is through the image in</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.660" end="01:15:51.840" style="s2">egocentric sort of like fixation right</p>

<p begin="01:18:13.170" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.560" end="01:18:18.030" style="s2">absolutely absolutely just one one</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:19.860" style="s2">practical thing just in terms of as we</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.030" end="01:18:23.190" style="s2">go forward with this so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.860" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna work out the outline I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.190" end="01:18:26.489" style="s2">send you the outline so we can get get</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:28.679" style="s2">to the the flow of it but I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.489" end="01:18:33.659" style="s2">at certain points we can just do a demo</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.679" end="01:18:35.369" style="s2">of these transitions right enacting a</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.659" end="01:18:38.070" style="s2">kind of a transitional point in</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.369" end="01:18:41.070" style="s2">different parts and I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.070" end="01:18:43.619" style="s2">working out the outline with this but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.070" end="01:18:46.469" style="s2">was thinking about just in terms of you</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.619" end="01:18:48.570" style="s2">know if we say in the PostScript of our</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.469" end="01:18:51.780" style="s2">last dialogue oh so Chris and I had just</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.570" end="01:18:54.869" style="s2">a spontaneous conversation about this in</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.780" end="01:18:58.020" style="s2">exemplified in like really drew out this</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.869" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">notion of the dialogical thought fire</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.020" end="01:19:02.780" style="s2">and we kinda came to this point like</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.239" end="01:19:06.659" style="s2">well oh yeah the logs are like the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.780" end="01:19:08.420" style="s2">propositions yes and and so in</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.659" end="01:19:10.860" style="s2">philosophy there&#39;s the there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.420" end="01:19:12.780" style="s2">propositions that the philosophers make</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.860" end="01:19:15.900" style="s2">the doctrines and all that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.780" end="01:19:18.750" style="s2">and so dialogue owes dialogic my sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.900" end="01:19:24.119" style="s2">was staying with this symbol like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.750" end="01:19:25.949" style="s2">engaging in the like dialogue he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.119" end="01:19:30.780" style="s2">beginning to bring these together which</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.949" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">is like starting to like spark it and at</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.780" end="01:19:35.400" style="s2">some point when the one that when the</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.360" end="01:19:38.159" style="s2">logos or the fire catches that&#39;s when it</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.400" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">goes into dialo goes right I agree I</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.159" end="01:19:41.550" style="s2">like the metaphor especially when you</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:46.460" style="s2">think about the fact that the wood is</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.550" end="01:19:46.460" style="s2">actually stored and shaped sunshine yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.980" end="01:19:53.090" style="s2">Hermes I can&#39;t take it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.239" end="01:20:01.889" style="s2">we have to if we can get back to the way</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.449" end="01:20:05.550" style="s2">of thinking and being the envisioning</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.889" end="01:20:08.010" style="s2">that then gets solidified in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.550" end="01:20:10.739" style="s2">proposition if we can require if we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.010" end="01:20:13.949" style="s2">recover the light that poured in that</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.739" end="01:20:17.099" style="s2">will also help to catch the fire so my</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.949" end="01:20:19.440" style="s2">thought was you know instead in looking</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.099" end="01:20:22.769" style="s2">at like through this process right</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.440" end="01:20:27.300" style="s2">through that symbol what occurred to me</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.769" end="01:20:30.809" style="s2">is that the this the circling right the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.300" end="01:20:33.599" style="s2">the at this level the inner subjective</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.809" end="01:20:35.400" style="s2">right of where we just have people talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.599" end="01:20:37.860" style="s2">about their lives like we get each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.400" end="01:20:40.800" style="s2">what we go back and forth we disclose</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.860" end="01:20:43.969" style="s2">each other and get that going right and</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.800" end="01:20:47.489" style="s2">at some point right we start to go okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.969" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">what are what are the emerging themes</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.489" end="01:20:53.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re hearing right what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.400" end="01:20:55.590" style="s2">what&#39;s the thing what&#39;s the and in that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.130" end="01:20:58.349" style="s2">emerging things is the articulation of</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.590" end="01:21:00.900" style="s2">the wood right so maybe what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.349" end="01:21:03.329" style="s2">hearing is something about crisis maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.900" end="01:21:05.159" style="s2">or about meaning or about some sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.329" end="01:21:07.650" style="s2">that&#39;s been guiding the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.159" end="01:21:09.480" style="s2">weaving and then cut in that that that</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.650" end="01:21:11.999" style="s2">the circling is in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.480" end="01:21:17.119" style="s2">gathering the wood or creating the wood</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.999" end="01:21:19.710" style="s2">did then we take that up right in right</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.119" end="01:21:22.170" style="s2">yeah yeah okay good</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.710" end="01:21:25.110" style="s2">as long as we keep as long as we keep</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.170" end="01:21:27.989" style="s2">tending to the fire yeah right so and</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.110" end="01:21:30.420" style="s2">that seems to be the tending the fire</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.989" end="01:21:33.960" style="s2">seems to be this sense that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.420" end="01:21:35.579" style="s2">imagining will happen naturally and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.960" end="01:21:38.429" style="s2">can notice it happening now sure but we</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.579" end="01:21:41.130" style="s2">can also evoke it which is this going up</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.429" end="01:21:43.739" style="s2">and then noticing and this is often the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.130" end="01:21:46.440" style="s2">sense I get with an insight an insight</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.739" end="01:21:48.840" style="s2">is that is that middle spot between</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.440" end="01:21:50.579" style="s2">bottom-up and top-down it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.840" end="01:21:52.679" style="s2">experience look like something comes</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.579" end="01:21:54.599" style="s2">together it&#39;s a flashlight it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.679" end="01:21:58.739" style="s2">a paragraph in fact you try to bring it</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.599" end="01:22:02.760" style="s2">okay if you have to you clumsily come to</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.739" end="01:22:04.949" style="s2">terms with that flash of light right so</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.760" end="01:22:06.360" style="s2">that sense of going up and then noticing</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.949" end="01:22:08.130" style="s2">how that if</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.360" end="01:22:09.630" style="s2">that&#39;s assault personally right in</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.130" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">bringing attention to their and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.630" end="01:22:14.850" style="s2">looking at that and going up and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">coming back down and getting I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.850" end="01:22:20.070" style="s2">very much yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:22.980" style="s2">Neoplatonic thing about right there the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.070" end="01:22:26.369" style="s2">return and then the progressed and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.980" end="01:22:28.730" style="s2">right the back and forth yeah and notice</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.369" end="01:22:31.650" style="s2">how the vertical dimension comes in</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.730" end="01:22:32.449" style="s2">integrated with the horizontal exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.650" end="01:22:35.489" style="s2">exactly</p>
