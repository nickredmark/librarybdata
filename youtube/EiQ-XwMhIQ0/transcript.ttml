<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">ones you know looking very sweet today</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">those I can see all right I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">living in a gift economy since the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:17.910" style="s2">of 2011 and the Peter was joking recent</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">with me when he was saying that the gift</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.910" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">economy that was that was game be years</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">before game he was even talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:30.299" style="s2">you can make about what you will</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">I was initially going to say quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.299" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">today about the gift economy but I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.330" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">too much to say about it and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:40.530" style="s2">the Zen thing to do and I&#39;m quite Zen</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">inspired it is to say very little about</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.530" end="00:02:45.959" style="s2">it and instead to allow for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:48.329" style="s2">questions to arise and then I think it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.959" end="00:02:51.049" style="s2">will become more coherent what this</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.329" end="00:02:51.049" style="s2">model is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.900" end="00:03:00.580" style="s2">so the the first thing I think to do is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:05.319" style="s2">just as best you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.580" end="00:03:09.220" style="s2">let go of everything you&#39;ve read from Z</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.319" end="00:03:13.060" style="s2">friends if French anthropologists but as</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.220" end="00:03:15.489" style="s2">a gift economy a long long time ago so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">let&#39;s just drop drop what you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.489" end="00:03:20.650" style="s2">there and drop what you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:24.579" style="s2">elsewhere or what you&#39;ve heard about</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.650" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">gift economies Peter says he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.579" end="00:03:32.650" style="s2">Oviatt I go back to Z French okay I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.510" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">many exits this is just one so we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.650" end="00:03:37.930" style="s2">we need to come to what Hakka want the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:40.569" style="s2">Zen master calls don&#39;t know mine first</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.930" end="00:03:43.510" style="s2">because you&#39;ve no doubt heard a number</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.569" end="00:03:46.060" style="s2">of things about gift economies so begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.510" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">with the Socratic understanding I do not</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.060" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">know what I thought I did</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.650" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.330" end="00:04:03.240" style="s2">okay so just sink into that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.450" end="00:04:05.690" style="s2">expansive openness and wide open</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.240" end="00:04:05.690" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.849" end="00:04:15.430" style="s2">the next thing I want to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.659" end="00:04:15.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:22.790" style="s2">and an exchange model are like chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.229" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">and vanilla</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.790" end="00:04:28.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not on the same ontological</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">plane</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.120" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">it&#39;s rather as if the market system is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">the waking state and the gift economy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">the dream state</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.380" end="00:04:47.750" style="s2">fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.350" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">they actually inhabit absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.750" end="00:04:53.570" style="s2">different worlds worlds of beam so allow</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">that to sink in a little bit they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.570" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">not talking about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">comparable we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.080" end="00:05:02.990" style="s2">fundamentally different systems because</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:05.930" style="s2">the mind is going to want to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.990" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">rather like what I know it&#39;s rather like</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.930" end="00:05:12.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m used to and so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:14.999" style="s2">inviting us to sink into this space of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.980" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">unfamiliarity</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.999" end="00:05:21.799" style="s2">which will also paradoxically be quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:21.799" style="s2">familiar to us than the final analysis</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.449" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">next I&#39;d like to start out by tying a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.529" end="00:05:35.749" style="s2">myths a myth or a mythos which is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:39.029" style="s2">Plato used to do and the Methos is meant</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.749" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">to introduce us to this fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.029" end="00:05:43.979" style="s2">different way of understanding and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:49.009" style="s2">you want and called a fairy tale that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.979" end="00:05:55.949" style="s2">fine too so imagine a land far far away</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.009" end="00:05:58.049" style="s2">or very very distant it&#39;s other science</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.949" end="00:06:01.469" style="s2">fiction or it&#39;s a fairy tale or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.049" end="00:06:04.589" style="s2">parable or some such and in this land</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.469" end="00:06:08.279" style="s2">far far away imagine that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.589" end="00:06:12.209" style="s2">people and there are two important</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.279" end="00:06:15.839" style="s2">features in this place one there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.209" end="00:06:18.269" style="s2">group of artists about whom more in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.839" end="00:06:22.379" style="s2">moment and the other thing we&#39;ll notice</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.269" end="00:06:24.409" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a house of worship set</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.379" end="00:06:25.940" style="s2">aside the house of worship for now</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.409" end="00:06:30.950" style="s2">now in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.940" end="00:06:35.650" style="s2">far far away place as people these</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.950" end="00:06:39.200" style="s2">people indeed others are so amazed by</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.650" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">these artists not by what they make but</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.200" end="00:06:47.030" style="s2">by how they live the end mass in unison</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">they say to themselves we love them so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:53.140" style="s2">we admire them so that we wish to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:53.140" style="s2">support them</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.980" end="00:06:59.620" style="s2">we will do whatever is necessary and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.310" end="00:07:03.430" style="s2">beyond what is necessary to support the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.620" end="00:07:06.430" style="s2">lives of artists and the artists are</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.430" end="00:07:10.060" style="s2">just filled with such a level of joy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.430" end="00:07:11.950" style="s2">gratitude that they are that they begin</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.060" end="00:07:14.730" style="s2">and continue to live these very</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.950" end="00:07:14.730" style="s2">beautiful lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.820" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">the lives committed to let&#39;s even call</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.640" end="00:07:21.540" style="s2">it sacred</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:23.720" style="s2">Archer contemplative art they no feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.540" end="00:07:26.660" style="s2">well if they don&#39;t have to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.720" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.660" end="00:07:32.870" style="s2">in any way that is exchangeable for what</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:36.490" style="s2">they&#39;ve received they know that in their</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.870" end="00:07:36.490" style="s2">hearts and their very beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.390" end="00:07:45.070" style="s2">what&#39;s really quite astonishing is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">out of a kind of fecundity of spirit</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.070" end="00:07:53.450" style="s2">artworks begin to so to speak create</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:55.820" style="s2">themselves and they go to the people at</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.450" end="00:07:57.770" style="s2">one point and say we have come up with</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.820" end="00:08:01.370" style="s2">these beautiful artworks and we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.770" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">that this piece might be wonderful in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.370" end="00:08:08.480" style="s2">the public square or that piece that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:12.170" style="s2">sculpture might be wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.480" end="00:08:16.220" style="s2">on this corner or this could be a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.170" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">mural and the people wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.220" end="00:08:20.780" style="s2">accept</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:20.780" style="s2">that gift</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:27.650" style="s2">what&#39;s important to notice here is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.430" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">or lies too much it&#39;s just that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.650" end="00:08:34.970" style="s2">no tit for tat the artwork comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:37.400" style="s2">place of fecundity and it is not coming</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.529" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">so I once had a patron and all I did it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.139" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">was provide money to me once every three</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">months me wish nothing in return</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.589" end="00:09:09.509" style="s2">worship so imagine people come into this</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.360" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">sacred place and every time they come in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.509" end="00:09:15.540" style="s2">there they feel that there is something</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.430" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">so out of the gift out of a number of</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">just going to say a few words about my</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:28.080" style="s2">own I was thinking about Homo economicus</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.800" end="00:10:42.209" style="s2">nuts-and-bolts impractical okay so if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.000" end="00:10:45.089" style="s2">ask ourselves the question what are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.209" end="00:10:48.899" style="s2">basic ways in which homo sapiens have</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.089" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">survived throughout the course of human</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:54.750" style="s2">I would submit that there have only ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.820" end="00:10:56.490" style="s2">been three three basic models and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.750" end="00:10:59.220" style="s2">can be conjoined in sundry ways but</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.490" end="00:11:00.839" style="s2">let&#39;s keep them separate for now one</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.220" end="00:11:04.080" style="s2">would be that they&#39;ve lived off the land</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.839" end="00:11:06.660" style="s2">we have lived off the land be it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.080" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">hunting and gathering or be it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.660" end="00:11:13.740" style="s2">the invention of agriculture that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:15.000" style="s2">first one Wendell Berry might come to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.740" end="00:11:17.370" style="s2">mind here for those who are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.000" end="00:11:20.220" style="s2">with his writings he&#39;s advocating for a</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.640" end="00:11:32.390" style="s2">following the second way refers to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:32.390" style="s2">market transactions for market exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.450" end="00:11:39.790" style="s2">for those who know me just bear in mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.639" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">that I&#39;m not critical of any market</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.790" end="00:11:45.639" style="s2">whatsoever I&#39;m critical of what Karl</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:48.970" style="s2">Polanyi called the market system the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.639" end="00:11:51.430" style="s2">market system transforms human life in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:53.589" style="s2">such a way that markets begin to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.430" end="00:11:56.649" style="s2">conjoined to markets and markets and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.589" end="00:11:59.170" style="s2">markets land becomes market and real</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.649" end="00:12:03.240" style="s2">estate real estate becomes a market for</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.240" end="00:12:08.760" style="s2">so the ground upon which we stand no</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.029" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">longer it seems to be a home in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.760" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">way in any case the second way is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:15.540" style="s2">through various forms of exchange you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:18.810" style="s2">taking 4/10 we should be clear about</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.540" end="00:12:21.029" style="s2">that that ranges from any exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.810" end="00:12:25.770" style="s2">money for a service or money for a</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.930" end="00:12:39.930" style="s2">human beings have tended survive is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.520" end="00:12:42.810" style="s2">through what I generously call a gift or</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.930" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">forms of gift that&#39;s why I use the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.810" end="00:12:47.550" style="s2">example of the patron of the arts or I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">used obviously a very idealized example</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.550" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">of house of worship to try to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:54.540" style="s2">first feel for what it&#39;s like for there</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.010" end="00:12:56.640" style="s2">to be communities they&#39;re oriented</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.540" end="00:13:02.370" style="s2">around genuine forms of giving and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.640" end="00:13:04.470" style="s2">receiving in a non tit-for-tat manner so</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.370" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">lastly before return to questions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.470" end="00:13:09.870" style="s2">answers I&#39;m going to just</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:12.990" style="s2">oh very briefly give you a sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.870" end="00:13:15.029" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought through this over the years</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.990" end="00:13:19.380" style="s2">what won&#39;t be clear from what I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.029" end="00:13:22.830" style="s2">to say is that a gift economy has a few</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.380" end="00:13:23.910" style="s2">vital elements one is timing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.830" end="00:13:27.089" style="s2">going to become clear because my</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.910" end="00:13:29.100" style="s2">thoughts are compressed into a space of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.089" end="00:13:33.860" style="s2">just a couple minutes but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.100" end="00:13:38.130" style="s2">imagine that the economic transaction is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.860" end="00:13:41.610" style="s2">instantaneous and frictionless but gift</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.130" end="00:13:42.630" style="s2">giving and receiving is slow and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.610" end="00:13:46.610" style="s2">follows an entirely different</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:49.980" style="s2">temporalities when you get what you give</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.610" end="00:13:53.700" style="s2">when you give the gift and how you give</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.980" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">the gift and with what graceful timing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.700" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">all come to matter and we know this from</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:01.740" style="s2">our own lives if your mother if your</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:02.279" style="s2">mother happens to give you a birthday</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.740" end="00:14:05.459" style="s2">gift</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.279" end="00:14:07.890" style="s2">two weeks after birthday you know that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.459" end="00:14:08.910" style="s2">something has gone awry there and if</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.350" end="00:14:18.060" style="s2">something has also gone awry so you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.520" end="00:14:19.500" style="s2">begin to see that a little bit when it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.060" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">comes to the gift economy have come up</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.500" end="00:14:24.149" style="s2">with a particular way of inquiring which</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">I call a direct inquiry into the gift</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.149" end="00:14:32.860" style="s2">economy it&#39;s quite complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:35.050" style="s2">here&#39;s a very simple version so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.860" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">philosophize the people philosophizing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.050" end="00:14:39.490" style="s2">is its own sort of thing a bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:45.280" style="s2">artists example I gave or the house of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.490" end="00:14:48.550" style="s2">worship example I gave providing gifts</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.280" end="00:14:50.740" style="s2">to support the life I lead is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">entirely different sort of thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.740" end="00:14:55.330" style="s2">talking about that different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:57.130" style="s2">thing and what follows there are three</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.330" end="00:15:00.660" style="s2">questions I tend to ask people at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.130" end="00:15:03.010" style="s2">particular moment in our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.660" end="00:15:05.470" style="s2">the first question is called the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.010" end="00:15:07.270" style="s2">question of proper generosity the second</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.470" end="00:15:09.280" style="s2">question is called that of onus or</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.270" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">burden and the third question has called</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.280" end="00:15:16.030" style="s2">the question of wholeheartedness and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">think this is actually a frilly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.030" end="00:15:20.860" style="s2">meditation but it&#39;s also analytical</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:22.030" style="s2">process and I think if you actually went</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.860" end="00:15:23.530" style="s2">through your thinking and you&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.030" end="00:15:25.780" style="s2">this is actually what our thinking does</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.530" end="00:15:27.940" style="s2">when it&#39;s going well when it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.780" end="00:15:30.700" style="s2">we get a gift so the first question I</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.940" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">ask people is how much during a certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.700" end="00:15:36.700" style="s2">period in question that you can specify</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:38.710" style="s2">are you able to give to me some material</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.700" end="00:15:40.770" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.710" end="00:15:40.770" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.840" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">straw dinelli dense question I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.840" end="00:15:46.840" style="s2">gonna leave it there and for now we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:48.910" style="s2">could unpack it later if we need to so</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.840" end="00:15:53.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say this up someone comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.910" end="00:15:58.570" style="s2">X like I can give X turn to question two</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.650" end="00:16:00.210" style="s2">I ask if you were to give X during a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.570" end="00:16:03.730" style="s2">certain period in question</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.210" end="00:16:06.010" style="s2">you can specify why we&#39;re doing so make</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.730" end="00:16:08.440" style="s2">it difficult if not impossible for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.010" end="00:16:10.740" style="s2">to care for yourself as well as those</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.440" end="00:16:13.480" style="s2">depend upon you</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.420" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">if the answer is yes it would make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.130" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">difficult we would return to question</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:23.230" style="s2">one I would ask the question again the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:26.579" style="s2">person would come up with a number</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.230" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">that&#39;s less than the original answer</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.579" end="00:16:33.060" style="s2">less than X if the person says no that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.890" style="s2">I&#39;ll usually go through a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.060" end="00:16:38.500" style="s2">then involves allowing that person to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.890" end="00:16:40.779" style="s2">see that there&#39;s a range so I so if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.500" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">answer was ax I said she said no it</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.779" end="00:16:44.649" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t make it difficult if not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:46.120" style="s2">impossible we would go up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.649" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">where there would be pain it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.120" end="00:16:50.410" style="s2">meditation that would be the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:53.200" style="s2">over generosity I feel as if I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.410" end="00:16:58.269" style="s2">too much and therefore as if I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.200" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">sacrificing myself so in my view proper</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.269" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">generosity is not an act of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.390" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">then we would go down and we&#39;d find that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a point at which there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:10.440" style="s2">different kind of pain the pain of under</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">generosity or what Aristotle called</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.440" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">miser leanness</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.360" end="00:17:19.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s a different kind of pain</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:22.180" style="s2">that&#39;s marked out now there&#39;s a range</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.630" end="00:17:24.670" style="s2">we might go back to the first question I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.180" end="00:17:26.650" style="s2">would ask it again</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.670" end="00:17:29.410" style="s2">can come up with the same answer give</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.650" end="00:17:32.410" style="s2">initially which was X or a number that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.410" end="00:17:34.650" style="s2">in that range I asked the second</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.410" end="00:17:36.750" style="s2">question again</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.650" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">be difficult if not impossible the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.750" end="00:17:43.020" style="s2">person let&#39;s say says no then we come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:45.510" style="s2">understand which of those different</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.020" end="00:17:47.730" style="s2">answers is the right one which one sits</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.510" end="00:17:49.830" style="s2">well on you which one feels right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.730" end="00:17:52.650" style="s2">an intuitive response but everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.830" end="00:17:54.540" style="s2">it actually everyone I&#39;m spoken with so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.650" end="00:17:57.030" style="s2">let&#39;s say that person says X X feels</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.540" end="00:17:58.710" style="s2">rank then I ask the question are you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.030" end="00:18:00.390" style="s2">willing to say then that X is neither</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.710" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">too much to give and light of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.390" end="00:18:05.630" style="s2">current material circumstances nor too</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:07.920" style="s2">little to give in light of your current</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">material circumstances but more or less</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.920" end="00:18:13.539" style="s2">just enough or the right amount</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:15.009" style="s2">if the person says no it&#39;s like chutes</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.539" end="00:18:17.320" style="s2">and ladders we&#39;ll go back to the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.009" end="00:18:19.690" style="s2">question and I&#39;ll ask it again I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.320" end="00:18:21.720" style="s2">them back down the person says yes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.690" end="00:18:25.629" style="s2">feels like the right amount just enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.720" end="00:18:28.450" style="s2">just just enough and we come to the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.629" end="00:18:30.009" style="s2">question the questionable hardness this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.450" end="00:18:32.139" style="s2">is a hard line question for those</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.009" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">interested in meditation you sink down</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.139" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">into the heart mind I ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.230" end="00:18:40.200" style="s2">if you were to give X during this period</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:42.940" style="s2">in question could you do so</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.200" end="00:18:45.039" style="s2">wholeheartedly that is without</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.940" end="00:18:52.139" style="s2">reservation without hesitation without</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.039" end="00:18:57.539" style="s2">contraction now burdened could you do so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.139" end="00:19:00.490" style="s2">freely seamlessly easily wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.539" end="00:19:05.100" style="s2">it just comes off the hand just like</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.490" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">water the person can say yes then I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.100" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">reply by saying yes I can accept the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">gift wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.430" end="00:19:18.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:20.350" style="s2">about where that fits in and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.760" end="00:19:23.380" style="s2">as if I just shot it out of a cannon at</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.350" end="00:19:24.790" style="s2">you but I want to turn to questions and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.380" end="00:19:27.550" style="s2">I think this will become clearer as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.790" end="00:19:28.750" style="s2">go along great so if you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.550" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">for Andrew just write in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.750" end="00:19:33.730" style="s2">I&#39;ll warm him up with a few so was</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:37.870" style="s2">coming up mine is the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.730" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">hurdles both with receiving a gift and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.870" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">giving a gift and for my experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">been a sort of a spiritual practice both</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:48.250" style="s2">both of those and I recall I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">when it was it that you and I first</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.250" end="00:20:02.050" style="s2">started 1982 vampires 2013 2013 Wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:03.310" style="s2">and I remember when I first we first was</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.050" end="00:20:04.810" style="s2">a Skype actually we first Skyped each</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.310" end="00:20:06.610" style="s2">other in and he started running me</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.810" end="00:20:10.680" style="s2">through those questions I&#39;m like hey</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.610" end="00:20:10.680" style="s2">this guy&#39;s weird he&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.910" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">I got converted but I imagine you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.080" end="00:20:20.380" style="s2">experience that you know that tension</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">like people like like what this is weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.380" end="00:20:24.910" style="s2">this is like you know unusual so how do</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:36.130" style="s2">you kind of on board people to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.910" end="00:20:38.610" style="s2">process and or what opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.130" end="00:20:44.170" style="s2">opportunity friend yeah part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.610" end="00:20:46.200" style="s2">prototyping process it&#39;s so when I said</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.170" end="00:20:51.010" style="s2">the temporality matters it really does</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.200" end="00:20:54.490" style="s2">so consider that someone has contacted</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.010" end="00:20:58.300" style="s2">me really timing timing really matter so</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.490" end="00:20:59.920" style="s2">someone contacted me a month ago and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.300" end="00:21:01.540" style="s2">then maybe a couple weeks later we go</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.920" end="00:21:02.890" style="s2">through a process of writing to one</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.540" end="00:21:06.820" style="s2">another to see whether or not were</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.890" end="00:21:11.230" style="s2">potentially a good companions as it were</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.820" end="00:21:12.850" style="s2">and we might have our first call a call</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.230" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">just an introductory call we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.850" end="00:21:16.570" style="s2">jamming I just want to get a feel for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:18.430" style="s2">this person I hope this person wants to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.570" end="00:21:20.740" style="s2">get a feel for me and there might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.430" end="00:21:23.170" style="s2">some more questions after the first call</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.740" end="00:21:25.270" style="s2">it&#39;s got an extensive sense our meeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.170" end="00:21:27.070" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a second call in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.270" end="00:21:29.860" style="s2">I go through more logistics all I say</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.070" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">there is are you open so if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.860" end="00:21:33.520" style="s2">this far are you open to being weird and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:34.900" style="s2">the person says yes I&#39;m open to being</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.520" end="00:21:36.730" style="s2">weird like okay well I&#39;ll tell you more</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.900" end="00:21:38.160" style="s2">about the gift economy later on but</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.730" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">let&#39;s just set it aside for now and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.160" end="00:21:43.179" style="s2">we&#39;ll hear more about it and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:44.770" style="s2">send some person some things to read</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.179" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">before our first philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.770" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">conversation and one of those will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">the gift economy inquiry and I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">you can read this think about a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:54.940" style="s2">bit and then set it aside because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:58.450" style="s2">don&#39;t want the shock value as I probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.940" end="00:22:00.370" style="s2">was presented to you and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">the first philosophic conversation let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.370" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">say and there might be two actually but</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:08.410" style="s2">notice how much time has elapsed is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:10.090" style="s2">first written inquiry it&#39;s now been at</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.410" end="00:22:11.830" style="s2">least a month or so and then the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.090" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">conversation might be a month or two</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.830" end="00:22:16.450" style="s2">months so the philosophical conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">might be a few months hence and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.450" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">first gift economy continent we finally</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:22.600" style="s2">get into it then I go through a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">strategic way of walking people through</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.600" end="00:22:26.260" style="s2">it where there&#39;s a story at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:28.750" style="s2">beginning and then there&#39;s a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.260" end="00:22:30.280" style="s2">exercise and then there&#39;s taking through</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.750" end="00:22:32.110" style="s2">the process of what I&#39;ve described in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.280" end="00:22:33.910" style="s2">about two minutes four people there and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.110" end="00:22:34.510" style="s2">then there&#39;s a series of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">answers</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.510" end="00:22:40.870" style="s2">all of these things are meant to try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">kind of sink someone into that space</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.870" end="00:22:45.730" style="s2">where it&#39;s very open very supple and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">person&#39;s already received a number of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.730" end="00:22:51.820" style="s2">gifts and obviously it knows at this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:56.020" style="s2">point that I&#39;m not out I&#39;m not out to -</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.820" end="00:22:57.940" style="s2">- it&#39;s not some kind of trick so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.020" end="00:23:00.250" style="s2">psychological defenses start to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.940" end="00:23:02.940" style="s2">loosened through the lengthy process</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.250" end="00:23:05.799" style="s2">that we&#39;ve undertaken and then in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.940" end="00:23:07.630" style="s2">conversation itself through that inquire</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.799" end="00:23:10.419" style="s2">itself then there are some that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.630" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">arise and they will be the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.419" end="00:23:15.460" style="s2">things we can inquire into and other</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:17.049" style="s2">philosophical conversations so no I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.460" end="00:23:19.990" style="s2">you have some kind of hang-ups around</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.049" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">money or a fear of scarcity okay well</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.990" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">we&#39;ll set that aside and we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">to it so the the the the the lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:31.799" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned here is a kind of unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:31.799" style="s2">of patience and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.830" style="s2">very difficult if it were just like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.890" end="00:23:41.429" style="s2">so that you got my transactions or or</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.929" end="00:23:53.940" style="s2">for tat I&#39;m I&#39;m just philosophizing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.540" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">just doing what it is that I do at some</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.940" end="00:23:58.290" style="s2">point this person can turn if she feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:24:01.710" style="s2">desire to to support the life I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.290" end="00:24:03.330" style="s2">leading mm-hmm I have a strong desire to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.710" end="00:24:09.750" style="s2">hear you snap one more time translation</p>

<p begin="00:24:14.690" end="00:24:20.100" style="s2">kind of the thing I want to turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:20.970" style="s2">giving of a gift right now and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.100" end="00:24:24.780" style="s2">actually talking to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.970" end="00:24:26.429" style="s2">Raven about this and I noticed like some</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.780" end="00:24:27.900" style="s2">viewing the stoah as a gift and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.429" end="00:24:31.380" style="s2">everything I&#39;m doing out of this I view</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.900" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">as a gift to the world right now and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.380" end="00:24:34.710" style="s2">Colin who you&#39;re gonna be talking to he</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:36.419" style="s2">sort of started his own digital dance</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.710" end="00:24:38.220" style="s2">studio it was inspired to a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.419" end="00:24:39.690" style="s2">that we had and then it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.220" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">same model of the stoah where he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.690" end="00:24:43.530" style="s2">of the steward and he&#39;s having more of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:46.110" style="s2">embodied practices and he&#39;s eating that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.530" end="00:24:48.210" style="s2">as a gift as well and I was telling</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.110" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">Raven it&#39;s like like there wasn&#39;t like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.210" end="00:24:53.790" style="s2">fear of losing Colin because Colin was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:55.559" style="s2">existential dance party every every</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.790" end="00:24:57.240" style="s2">Thursday and there&#39;s a fear of losing</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.559" end="00:24:59.280" style="s2">him as a facilitator is a fear of losing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.240" end="00:25:01.320" style="s2">Raven as a facilitator because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.280" end="00:25:02.520" style="s2">both super talented you&#39;re cool they</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.320" end="00:25:03.990" style="s2">like this nice aesthetics and like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">want you to be part of stola you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.990" end="00:25:07.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like it makes the gift even even</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.990" style="s2">more cool and awesome</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.980" end="00:25:11.820" style="s2">and so it&#39;s almost like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.990" end="00:25:13.110" style="s2">engineer control the gift you know like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.820" end="00:25:15.809" style="s2">I want to control the outcome of a gift</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.110" end="00:25:17.220" style="s2">but then it&#39;s not about that like I I</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.809" end="00:25:18.750" style="s2">know when to lovely it&#39;s not about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.220" end="00:25:21.660" style="s2">so it&#39;s just sort of that teasing</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.750" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">process and just letting that go hence</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.660" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">why I mentioned it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:27.480" style="s2">spiritual practice just getting this so</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:39.830" style="s2">I wonder if you can speak on that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.480" end="00:25:41.970" style="s2">maybe your experience with it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.830" end="00:25:43.380" style="s2">remember when I was first starting to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.970" end="00:25:45.750" style="s2">philosophize and I had all these cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.380" end="00:25:48.590" style="s2">people wanting to philosophize me and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.750" end="00:25:48.590" style="s2">I have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.920" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">including wow this is amazing this is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.710" end="00:25:58.890" style="s2">this is so different from academia but</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">and what I was used to and the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.890" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">that were happening in the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:08.760" style="s2">were so wild and interesting and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:10.020" style="s2">know altered states of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.760" end="00:26:12.150" style="s2">such they find this is really quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.020" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">something what&#39;s happening and so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.150" end="00:26:18.929" style="s2">started to get attached to people and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:20.550" style="s2">that that happens but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.929" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">simple lesson is that if you go through</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.550" end="00:26:24.750" style="s2">a gift economy enough and if you go</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:26.700" style="s2">through having a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.750" end="00:26:29.160" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously Buddhist impermanence is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.700" end="00:26:30.809" style="s2">a Nietzsche you start to realize as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.160" end="00:26:32.190" style="s2">have store as you&#39;ve a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.809" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">practice long enough that people will</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.190" end="00:26:35.670" style="s2">come and go if they&#39;re an accord and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.500" style="s2">becomes easier just to become less</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.670" end="00:26:39.870" style="s2">attached because you think wow Colin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.500" end="00:26:41.100" style="s2">lovely but I suspect that other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.870" end="00:26:43.320" style="s2">are going to be interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.100" end="00:26:45.270" style="s2">wonderful in different ways as well and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.320" end="00:26:46.830" style="s2">this is going to be this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.270" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">a little like a tea shop in which people</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.830" end="00:26:50.490" style="s2">come in they stay for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:52.110" style="s2">some will stay but longer so I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.490" end="00:26:55.340" style="s2">take it as a so long and they&#39;ll hang</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.110" end="00:26:57.720" style="s2">out there and some will just go once and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.340" end="00:26:59.070" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s strange that mean we talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.720" end="00:26:59.490" style="s2">about this in Buddhism Aiko and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.070" end="00:27:01.500" style="s2">Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.490" end="00:27:04.200" style="s2">obviously you permanence things come and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.500" end="00:27:07.559" style="s2">go but when you start to actually taste</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.200" end="00:27:09.030" style="s2">impermanence then you relax and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.559" end="00:27:11.240" style="s2">realize that there&#39;s nothing to hold on</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.030" end="00:27:11.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.330" end="00:27:17.160" style="s2">I won&#39;t you know I won&#39;t perish even if</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.050" end="00:27:19.860" style="s2">the stove perishes</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.160" end="00:27:23.310" style="s2">I won&#39;t perish even it&#39;s the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.860" end="00:27:26.010" style="s2">practice perishes and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.310" end="00:27:31.290" style="s2">continue to unwind as long as it unwinds</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.010" end="00:27:33.570" style="s2">and to be whatever it is it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.290" end="00:27:36.030" style="s2">amazing man I&#39;m trying to put this into</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.570" end="00:27:38.310" style="s2">words but it&#39;s the sentiment the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.030" end="00:27:43.950" style="s2">the felt sense as you call it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.310" end="00:27:49.230" style="s2">very clear mm-hmm yeah I just have a was</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.950" end="00:27:52.950" style="s2">like grateful that I know you so the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.230" end="00:27:57.960" style="s2">the last question is and I told you this</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.950" end="00:27:59.940" style="s2">already so when I like so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.960" end="00:28:01.730" style="s2">receiving gifts in the form of how and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.940" end="00:28:04.940" style="s2">you know kind of like people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.730" end="00:28:07.790" style="s2">programming things and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.940" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">and people are also gifting money and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.790" end="00:28:14.130" style="s2">via PayPal and I mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">some somewhere but so I took a break</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.130" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">last week from all these like day one</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:19.260" style="s2">insights and like I just like take it</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:22.350" style="s2">together take a break and just watch a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.260" end="00:28:26.220" style="s2">movie and so we watched a Camille and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.350" end="00:28:28.920" style="s2">we watched the Guy Ritchie movie and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.220" end="00:28:30.600" style="s2">paid with that with the PayPal money and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.920" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a freaking like a ray of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.600" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">light just felt like Shh</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:38.300" style="s2">just like you know shining on me this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:40.350" style="s2">so pure like I never felt that at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.300" end="00:28:41.880" style="s2">buying anything but I bought it with</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.350" end="00:28:44.580" style="s2">that gift money and then it just felt so</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.880" end="00:28:46.290" style="s2">right oh my gosh it&#39;s so sad she was</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.580" end="00:28:48.300" style="s2">onto something with this let&#39;s get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.290" end="00:28:49.950" style="s2">kind of thing saying you said you had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.300" end="00:28:53.510" style="s2">similar experience I&#39;m wondering like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.950" end="00:28:56.250" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there I just remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.510" end="00:28:59.480" style="s2">well I think people here know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.250" end="00:28:59.480" style="s2">like to receive a gift</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.310" end="00:29:06.430" style="s2">and it might be in the form of money and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.230" end="00:29:08.710" style="s2">it came out of the blue and someone said</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.430" end="00:29:13.020" style="s2">I was thinking of you or I thought you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.710" end="00:29:15.370" style="s2">could use this or here it feels amazing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.020" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinary it might even be not</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.370" end="00:29:19.570" style="s2">that much money</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:22.450" style="s2">now contrast that with category to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.570" end="00:29:25.660" style="s2">market situation we&#39;re talking about if</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.450" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">only briefly before you did some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.660" end="00:29:31.240" style="s2">gig a freelance gig an accounting owes</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">you money and you&#39;re following up with</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.240" end="00:29:37.720" style="s2">accounting thrice you&#39;ve and you&#39;ve to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">ring to bring that freaking check out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.720" end="00:29:43.140" style="s2">them and you finally get it what do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:45.540" style="s2">feel relief</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.140" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">at best that&#39;s the phenomenology I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.540" end="00:29:48.300" style="s2">relieved</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:51.950" style="s2">you feel nothing if the Paycheck comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.300" end="00:29:51.950" style="s2">over two weeks or you feel relieved</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.119" end="00:29:57.480" style="s2">the tastes are totally different I</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.040" end="00:37:57.900" style="s2">is that when I talked with those three</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.240" end="00:38:01.780" style="s2">models very briefly living off the land</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.900" end="00:38:04.180" style="s2">perspicuous use of markets and gifts</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.780" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">there&#39;s what when daniel would call here</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.180" end="00:38:08.410" style="s2">skill when it comes to knowing when you</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.410" end="00:38:11.830" style="s2">the third if I&#39;m going to a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.119" end="00:38:15.099" style="s2">organization giving a talk I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.830" end="00:38:18.130" style="s2">to say okay now let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.099" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">gift economy no no I have unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.130" end="00:38:21.490" style="s2">have to enter into a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:23.170" style="s2">relationship which is like I call a ship</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.490" end="00:38:25.960" style="s2">of fairness and it&#39;s what the market</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.170" end="00:38:28.119" style="s2">will will bear yield here so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.960" end="00:38:29.910" style="s2">to charge what a speaker at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.119" end="00:38:33.340" style="s2">particular level is going to charge</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.340" end="00:38:38.080" style="s2">into an esoteric quasi-mystical</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.099" end="00:38:39.790" style="s2">relationship with them because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.080" end="00:38:41.859" style="s2">not the sort of thing that they&#39;re tuned</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.790" end="00:38:44.619" style="s2">into here I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.859" end="00:38:46.359" style="s2">things I noticed as well some artists</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.619" end="00:38:48.390" style="s2">they&#39;re a little dogmatic okay I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.359" end="00:38:50.920" style="s2">your gift it&#39;s just gonna be just gifts</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.390" end="00:38:53.710" style="s2">well we&#39;re living in a kind of carry</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.920" end="00:38:55.930" style="s2">between game a and game B so being</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.710" end="00:38:58.570" style="s2">skillful requires learning the different</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.930" end="00:39:01.330" style="s2">models and being sufficiently skillful</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.570" end="00:39:04.330" style="s2">at them so that&#39;s the kind of first and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.330" end="00:39:07.510" style="s2">second remark the last one is a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.330" end="00:39:08.710" style="s2">bit sophisticated philosophically and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.510" end="00:39:10.089" style="s2">won&#39;t go too much into it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.710" end="00:39:12.820" style="s2">think there&#39;s anything called mean for</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.089" end="00:39:15.160" style="s2">work and I&#39;ll just plant that seed today</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.820" end="00:39:17.530" style="s2">for anyone who wants just to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.160" end="00:39:21.400" style="s2">bit provoked so just a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.530" end="00:39:25.290" style="s2">provocation what I do think is that an</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.400" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">artist has a kind of practice of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.290" end="00:39:31.900" style="s2">is that my wife&#39;s an artist the art the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:33.790" style="s2">artist artists kind of revealed that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.900" end="00:39:34.990" style="s2">gift Lois I would talk about it in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.790" end="00:39:37.900" style="s2">manner if you&#39;ve ever read his book the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.990" end="00:39:42.580" style="s2">gift so the first step is that art</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.900" end="00:39:43.340" style="s2">itself is a gift that&#39;s the ontology the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.580" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">second step is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.340" end="00:39:48.500" style="s2">if you have to enter into selling your</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:50.440" style="s2">art then there&#39;s a transmogrification of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.500" end="00:39:53.810" style="s2">the art object into a commodity and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.440" end="00:39:54.970" style="s2">that&#39;s for letting go takes place so it</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.810" end="00:39:59.330" style="s2">was a gift</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.970" end="00:40:03.610" style="s2">now it&#39;s transmogrified into something</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.330" end="00:40:06.380" style="s2">that can be bought sold etc etc so</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.610" end="00:40:09.380" style="s2">there&#39;s you know if we can get our</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.380" end="00:40:11.180" style="s2">understanding clearer than in buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.380" end="00:40:12.770" style="s2">terms a lot of the Duker and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:14.570" style="s2">suffering that we ordinary experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.770" end="00:40:17.750" style="s2">will start to subside</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.570" end="00:40:20.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the these these exercises and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.750" end="00:40:21.770" style="s2">thought I just provided are meant to</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.030" end="00:40:23.270" style="s2">allow us to sit more comfortably with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.770" end="00:40:28.430" style="s2">herself and be more at peace with</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.270" end="00:40:31.610" style="s2">ourselves so an answer to your answer a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.430" end="00:40:33.230" style="s2">basic question I&#39;m not persuaded that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.610" end="00:40:35.510" style="s2">you would begin by scaling up gift</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.230" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">economies I you would begin by these</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.510" end="00:40:39.440" style="s2">experimentations experiments with it</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:41.270" style="s2">such as the stoah see what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.440" end="00:40:44.360" style="s2">them see if they can be replicated</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.270" end="00:40:46.370" style="s2">elsewhere and move in a quasi viral</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.360" end="00:40:52.210" style="s2">fashion rather than in a Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.370" end="00:41:00.920" style="s2">scaling up fashion yeah there resonates</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.210" end="00:41:02.450" style="s2">Tyson you had a question hey Angie yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.920" end="00:41:05.870" style="s2">good to see you it&#39;s good to see you in</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.450" end="00:41:07.790" style="s2">this um the spark that I sense in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.870" end="00:41:08.890" style="s2">expression and it&#39;s not gonna bug me and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.790" end="00:41:11.360" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.890" end="00:41:18.050" style="s2">yeah like lots of questions coming up</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.360" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">and let&#39;s see I&#39;m curious in what in</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.050" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">what situation would you choose not to</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:28.700" style="s2">work with someone that was inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:31.250" style="s2">about a gift and and then also in what</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.700" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">cases if ever have you approached</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.250" end="00:41:36.200" style="s2">someone and been like I have a gift</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.650" end="00:41:38.870" style="s2">you also do that or are you primarily</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.200" end="00:41:41.540" style="s2">having people inquire with you yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.870" end="00:41:43.100" style="s2">think I&#39;m curious about like B there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.540" end="00:41:45.620" style="s2">this idea that people don&#39;t value what</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.100" end="00:41:47.120" style="s2">they pay for and like or that money is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.620" end="00:41:49.790" style="s2">kind of someone paying for something</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.120" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">that&#39;s like the filter that would filter</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.790" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">out people that it wasn&#39;t important to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:56.610" style="s2">UM if they didn&#39;t pay for it so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:41:58.740" style="s2">know let me come to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.610" end="00:42:00.540" style="s2">I want to I want to come back to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.740" end="00:42:01.830" style="s2">questions you have but I want to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.540" end="00:42:04.530" style="s2">last part so there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.830" end="00:42:06.930" style="s2">intervention people don&#39;t value what</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:11.310" style="s2">they pay for that&#39;s in the second</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:14.130" style="s2">category of market exchanges and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.310" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">what we&#39;re accustomed to hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.130" end="00:42:21.690" style="s2">really hard thing to see is I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.170" end="00:42:23.430" style="s2">provide you with a little picture let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:26.070" style="s2">imagine that art or philosophy or</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.430" end="00:42:27.630" style="s2">whatever it is whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.070" end="00:42:28.620" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna call it philosophy because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.630" end="00:42:32.850" style="s2">so I&#39;m accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.620" end="00:42:34.470" style="s2">that&#39;s this is it&#39;s my own art form so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.850" end="00:42:36.870" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine that philosophy is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.470" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">one stream you philosophy philosophize</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.870" end="00:42:43.700" style="s2">with someone else and say it has its own</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:47.550" style="s2">rate it flows along at its own Taoist ik</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.700" end="00:42:52.020" style="s2">and its own dialing stick away it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.550" end="00:42:53.220" style="s2">entirely unto itself that&#39;s that is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.020" end="00:42:54.750" style="s2">I&#39;m here for</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.220" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">I opened myself to the other Emery</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.750" end="00:43:01.380" style="s2">philosophize now let&#39;s imagine we went</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">all the way across the country there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.380" end="00:43:05.940" style="s2">another stream but I early different</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">profile and characteristics and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.940" end="00:43:13.250" style="s2">label will be gift economy has its own</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:15.620" style="s2">flow it has its own way of lending</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.250" end="00:43:20.940" style="s2">effectively that&#39;s supporting the body</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.620" end="00:43:22.590" style="s2">my body and my wife&#39;s body notice the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:25.110" style="s2">way I told a story there are two</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.590" end="00:43:27.810" style="s2">different streams with their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.110" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">properties their own manners of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.810" end="00:43:32.390" style="s2">proceeding</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2">so a gift economy is such that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.390" end="00:43:37.820" style="s2">actually Brook the possibility that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:41.840" style="s2">you you you value what you pay for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.820" end="00:43:44.660" style="s2">requires the equivalence relationship so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.840" end="00:43:47.210" style="s2">what I&#39;m denying and a gift economy is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.660" end="00:43:49.220" style="s2">that there could ever be an equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.210" end="00:43:50.660" style="s2">and this makes good intuitive sense when</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.220" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">you hear Socrates say that he would</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.660" end="00:43:54.829" style="s2">never accept money exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:57.650" style="s2">transaction is this office - he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.829" end="00:43:59.809" style="s2">pointing to the sacred quality of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.650" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">philosophy that&#39;s beyond price or if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.809" end="00:44:03.109" style="s2">point if you if you go to manual Conti</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:05.240" style="s2">says that there&#39;s certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.109" end="00:44:07.550" style="s2">are beyond fancy price or a market price</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.240" end="00:44:10.970" style="s2">I think it&#39;s maybe actually translated</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.550" end="00:44:12.290" style="s2">fancy price I&#39;m not mistaken that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.970" end="00:44:13.339" style="s2">pointing at something that we believe in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.290" end="00:44:15.020" style="s2">that there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.339" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t fall into this paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.020" end="00:44:21.050" style="s2">but we have bodies right there bodies</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:23.079" style="s2">that perish they need to somehow be be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.050" end="00:44:26.690" style="s2">supported by food and other basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.079" end="00:44:29.180" style="s2">so what is the hack here so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.690" end="00:44:32.270" style="s2">that allows us to be consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.180" end="00:44:33.700" style="s2">ourselves while also being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.270" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">support ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.700" end="00:44:38.510" style="s2">that&#39;s this two-streams metaphor and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">know that took a little while to to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.510" end="00:44:41.960" style="s2">explain but it&#39;s really important to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:44.599" style="s2">clear about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.960" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">because each every time when you come to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.599" end="00:44:48.410" style="s2">even alternative communities and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.569" style="s2">grooving they say man just give whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.410" end="00:44:52.819" style="s2">give whatever you feel like you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.569" end="00:44:55.609" style="s2">usually they&#39;re still involved in</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.819" end="00:44:59.510" style="s2">transactions they&#39;re saying I felt good</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.609" end="00:45:02.059" style="s2">about it so even you go to a Laplace</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">nough ten-day retreat it says it says</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.059" end="00:45:07.010" style="s2">about Donna give based on what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:11.030" style="s2">benefited from here are you kidding me</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.010" end="00:45:12.980" style="s2">that&#39;s just egoic it&#39;s another tit for</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.030" end="00:45:17.210" style="s2">tat so what they really should say is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.980" end="00:45:20.210" style="s2">give out of the spirit of wanting other</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.210" end="00:45:23.059" style="s2">people to benefit from this or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.210" end="00:45:26.540" style="s2">like that so now when I come to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.059" end="00:45:29.720" style="s2">questions after I&#39;ve disentangle thank</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.540" end="00:45:33.230" style="s2">you yeah my thing the the core of my</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.720" end="00:45:37.819" style="s2">curiosity is how you personally choose</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.230" end="00:45:39.500" style="s2">or maybe create filters or how yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.819" end="00:45:43.240" style="s2">in what cases you would choose not to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.500" end="00:45:43.240" style="s2">work with someone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.790" end="00:45:53.220" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t call work but we&#39;ll get onto</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.980" end="00:45:57.700" style="s2">that some other time</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.220" end="00:46:00.190" style="s2">Jose contemplate or philosophize all</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.700" end="00:46:02.470" style="s2">right so yeah so there at least a number</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.190" end="00:46:04.270" style="s2">of different ways of sorting that out</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.470" end="00:46:07.150" style="s2">but here are ways that I&#39;ve mattered to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.270" end="00:46:10.630" style="s2">me one I look for someone who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.150" end="00:46:12.280" style="s2">reliable or conscientious if I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.630" end="00:46:14.350" style="s2">to sit down and philosophize with</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.280" end="00:46:17.620" style="s2">someone I want to be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.350" end="00:46:23.860" style="s2">person is there I don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.620" end="00:46:26.320" style="s2">about that or if I write a note to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.860" end="00:46:28.090" style="s2">person I want that person to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.320" end="00:46:29.980" style="s2">know that he or she can write a note</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.090" end="00:46:34.810" style="s2">back it should be like a dance</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.980" end="00:46:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so clear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.810" end="00:46:39.160" style="s2">so very clear so rescheduling isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.120" end="00:46:42.010" style="s2">an admin problem it suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.160" end="00:46:45.220" style="s2">there&#39;s been a certain failure in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.010" end="00:46:46.180" style="s2">relationship something is awry here all</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:48.040" style="s2">right so that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:49.360" style="s2">conscientiousness or reliability or</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.040" end="00:46:51.930" style="s2">whatever you want to call that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.360" end="00:46:55.240" style="s2">second the second characteristic is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.930" end="00:46:56.740" style="s2">courage because philosophy is tends to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.240" end="00:46:59.140" style="s2">take us to some dark places so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.740" end="00:47:02.030" style="s2">person requires or needs to exhibit</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.140" end="00:47:04.490" style="s2">intellectual and moral courage</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.030" end="00:47:07.090" style="s2">and I could say more about that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.490" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">moving quickly here that third one is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.090" end="00:47:12.410" style="s2">open-mindedness and open-heartedness I</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:16.010" style="s2">think we know what that&#39;s like at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.410" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">stoah that is there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.010" end="00:47:19.850" style="s2">it&#39;s like to be close-minded and shut</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:22.340" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.850" end="00:47:25.550" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t possible I would resist this</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.340" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">I know what I know it is so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.550" end="00:47:29.630" style="s2">nails like to be open-minded and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:33.290" style="s2">open-hearted someone really has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.630" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">like that to philosophize and the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:38.680" style="s2">one is there are many more but the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:41.560" style="s2">one that&#39;s important here would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.680" end="00:47:45.710" style="s2">inquisitiveness the person has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.560" end="00:47:47.090" style="s2">disposed to asking a question so those</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.710" end="00:47:49.220" style="s2">are that&#39;s kind of the first screen</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.090" end="00:47:50.840" style="s2">process is this true of this person and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.220" end="00:47:53.180" style="s2">then if we got into the gift economy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:56.450" style="s2">the person said I&#39;d like to offer you an</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.180" end="00:47:57.770" style="s2">American penny they&#39;re all those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.450" end="00:47:59.840" style="s2">of different cases we could look at I</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.770" end="00:48:01.850" style="s2">like to offer you an American penny and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.840" end="00:48:03.790" style="s2">this person let&#39;s say happens to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.850" end="00:48:07.070" style="s2">CEO at a fortune 50 company</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.790" end="00:48:09.020" style="s2">hypothetically speaking so it seems you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.070" end="00:48:12.770" style="s2">know patently unreasonable that a penny</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.020" end="00:48:14.360" style="s2">is just enough for this person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">being quite a bit more I would realize I</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.360" end="00:48:17.150" style="s2">probably had that conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.750" style="s2">there and then with that person but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.150" end="00:48:22.490" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have any more because what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.750" end="00:48:25.070" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to cultivate as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.490" end="00:48:26.930" style="s2">certain kind of relationship in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.070" end="00:48:30.200" style="s2">there is the possibility of going along</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.930" end="00:48:31.970" style="s2">together and someone who is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.200" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">been educated in such a ways to be so</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.970" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">grossly ungenerous and not to care about</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:38.600" style="s2">generosity is probably not someone I</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">want to be around so when I philosophize</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.600" end="00:48:42.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s of the form I like it to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:45.170" style="s2">around this person neither he or she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.500" end="00:48:47.340" style="s2">very lovely person wouldn&#39;t be lovely to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.170" end="00:48:50.280" style="s2">philosophize together</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.340" end="00:48:51.570" style="s2">so I I take that process to be I take</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.280" end="00:48:54.390" style="s2">that process very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.570" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t just philosophize with anyone I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.390" end="00:48:59.120" style="s2">want to make sure that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:00.710" style="s2">jamming together</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.120" end="00:49:02.690" style="s2">and there are different ways in which it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.710" end="00:49:06.620" style="s2">becomes clear that we&#39;re not if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.690" end="00:49:10.100" style="s2">true and if it can&#39;t be kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.620" end="00:49:11.840" style="s2">resistance can&#39;t end but then it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:17.750" style="s2">lot of sense just to say I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.840" end="00:49:19.460" style="s2">this is not this is not that cool so</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.750" end="00:49:24.250" style="s2">this this might be the last question</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.460" end="00:49:31.100" style="s2">rheya you ask your question to Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.250" end="00:49:32.390" style="s2">sure thanks hi Andrew my question so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.100" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">imagine that building this type of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.390" end="00:49:37.070" style="s2">economy has come with a lot of trial and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">error and I was wondering what you view</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.070" end="00:49:41.900" style="s2">as like the greatest strength or victory</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">of the gift economy and what has been</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.900" end="00:49:49.400" style="s2">the biggest challenge in really</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:52.670" style="s2">establishing like a cohesive foundation</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.400" end="00:49:57.560" style="s2">of this type of exchange economy</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.670" end="00:49:58.910" style="s2">community that&#39;s not an exchange but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.560" end="00:50:00.260" style="s2">not trying to get hit too clear I just</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.910" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">want to be sure that&#39;s clear yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.260" end="00:50:05.060" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an exchange can only</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:08.690" style="s2">occur when there&#39;s an equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.060" end="00:50:12.320" style="s2">between like things so back to your</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.690" end="00:50:14.660" style="s2">lovely questions the I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.320" end="00:50:20.390" style="s2">there been this looks like two basic</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:24.050" style="s2">successes the first is that someone as</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.390" end="00:50:26.430" style="s2">an Orthodox is I have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.050" end="00:50:29.970" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.430" end="00:50:31.319" style="s2">the case with lots of people with whom I</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.970" end="00:50:37.890" style="s2">philosophized over the last 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.319" end="00:50:39.750" style="s2">that people are basically generous if</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.890" end="00:50:41.430" style="s2">they&#39;re in the right conditions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.750" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">they&#39;re given the opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.430" end="00:50:45.829" style="s2">they&#39;re opened up so the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:48.660" style="s2">human beings are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.829" end="00:50:51.510" style="s2">self-interested self calculating utility</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.660" end="00:50:54.740" style="s2">maximizing creatures I think isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.510" end="00:50:59.010" style="s2">grounded its historically contingent</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.740" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">economic phenomenon that&#39;s it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.010" end="00:51:03.240" style="s2">huge success I think when you actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:05.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve just noticed that when people</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.819" end="00:52:40.140" style="s2">you you need to be very clear very</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.190" end="00:52:43.230" style="s2">intelligible and I wasn&#39;t and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.140" end="00:52:45.240" style="s2">was that was very unfortunate so I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.230" end="00:52:46.710" style="s2">get some very interesting gifts while I</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.240" end="00:52:48.600" style="s2">was living in New York City I got a pair</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.710" end="00:52:54.410" style="s2">of tarped and I got a man with like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.600" end="00:52:59.370" style="s2">bull penis penny container made of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.410" end="00:53:00.050" style="s2">seriously Peter I did and I&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.370" end="00:53:03.800" style="s2">artworks</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.050" end="00:53:06.210" style="s2">a lot of artworks I&#39;m living you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.800" end="00:53:06.660" style="s2">I&#39;d actually had some food on the table</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.210" end="00:53:09.570" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.660" end="00:53:11.880" style="s2">so it was an obvious case of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.570" end="00:53:13.620" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t know I had yet to learn</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.880" end="00:53:15.150" style="s2">how to ask questions if you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.620" end="00:53:19.380" style="s2">questions that just can you give it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:21.690" style="s2">you give a gift yes give all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:23.460" style="s2">gifts so took a while to realize that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.690" end="00:53:24.750" style="s2">needed to be as philosophical rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.460" end="00:53:26.700" style="s2">when it came to the questions I asked</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.750" end="00:53:28.440" style="s2">people as I was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.700" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">philosophizing with them so the question</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:32.310" style="s2">how much are you able to give to me some</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:34.050" style="s2">material needs is a question I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.310" end="00:53:36.270" style="s2">vetted each and each part of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.050" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">question which would be another two of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.270" end="00:53:41.550" style="s2">these stoechas would take a while to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:43.890" style="s2">unpack and then the question itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.550" end="00:53:48.990" style="s2">allowed there to be a specific clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.890" end="00:53:51.960" style="s2">answer yeah what&#39;s what&#39;s coming up for</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.990" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">me right there is because right now what</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.850" end="00:54:40.290" style="s2">time I&#39;ll just say that I learned as I</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.700" end="00:54:44.700" style="s2">was telling Raya that the question has</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.290" end="00:54:46.410" style="s2">to be very clear and that can be a broad</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.700" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">question it&#39;s just a very clear broad</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.410" end="00:54:52.020" style="s2">question but if you just amazed you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:53.400" style="s2">on the stove if you just say this exists</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:53.910" style="s2">in a gift economy and you feel called to</p>
