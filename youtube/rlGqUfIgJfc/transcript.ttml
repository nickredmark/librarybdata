<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:04.049" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go through quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.740" end="00:00:05.790" style="s2">material today and a bit of it will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:07.400" style="s2">reviewed but not very much okay so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:09.210" style="s2">started with this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.400" end="00:00:10.790" style="s2">propositions here that you&#39;re viewing</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.210" end="00:00:13.320" style="s2">the world through a narrative framework</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.790" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">and the narrative framework basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">lays out the world for you as a place in</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">which you can act and the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">you act is to make the state that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">in current that the state that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">moving to next better than the state</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;re in now now part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">that I had you write about your past was</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:35.579" style="s2">because the early cognitive scientists</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:37.860" style="s2">sort of took it for granted that your</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.579" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">model of where you are now wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.860" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">actually a model it was just reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:43.620" style="s2">because you look out in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">you can see the reality and there you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.620" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">but that&#39;s not true because because</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re as constrained with</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:56.250" style="s2">regards to the information that you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">at hand about the present just as much</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.250" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">as you are about the future or the past</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">then your your conceptualization of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">present is also a model just like your</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">conceptualization of the future and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">reason that&#39;s so important to know is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">that if when you&#39;re moving from point A</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">to point B you make an error the error</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">could be that you&#39;ve predicted the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">future or construed the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.470" style="s2">inaccurately but it could also be that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve construed the present or the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.470" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">inaccurately and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">you didn&#39;t start from where you thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">you were starting you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">happens for example that will happen if</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">you&#39;re moving forward and you discover</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">that you have weaknesses of one form or</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">another that you didn&#39;t know about when</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">you made the original plan and that what</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">that means is that you&#39;re your current</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">conception of yourself is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">inaccurate so that you can&#39;t move from</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">that conception to the future desired</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:52.380" style="s2">state without error and the other reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you that is because one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.380" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">what that also helps you understand is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">how broad the domain of potential error</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">is when something you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">happens because not only does it throw</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">the future that you&#39;re conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">into doubt it also throws the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">conceptualization of you as a being in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">the present into doubt and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">obvious at all when you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:17.849" style="s2">the initial search we&#39;re in which of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">those domains you&#39;re going to find the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.849" end="00:02:25.049" style="s2">error or where and so it&#39;s error is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">more complex problem than the than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.049" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">cognitive scientists who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">in the comparator models of of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">cybernetic processing hadn&#39;t had ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">conceptualize because they thought they</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:37.379" style="s2">kind of thought in behaviorist terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">which is while the world just presents</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.379" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">itself to you as it is so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:43.379" style="s2">going to be making any errors of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:45.030" style="s2">fundamental perception you just might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.379" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">making errors of prediction but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.030" end="00:02:51.349" style="s2">far too optimistic now we also know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">this fundamental narrative framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.349" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">which gives you a sense of the value of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">your current position and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:02:59.609" style="s2">destination because you&#39;re a moat you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:01.769" style="s2">a moving creature you&#39;re an active</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.609" end="00:03:03.390" style="s2">living creature that&#39;s interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.769" end="00:03:04.579" style="s2">the world and transforming it all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.390" end="00:03:07.709" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.579" end="00:03:10.290" style="s2">there&#39;s also there are also constraints</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.709" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">on which the narrative that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.290" end="00:03:16.019" style="s2">to conceptualize and act out can exist</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:18.019" style="s2">and the constraints are well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.019" end="00:03:20.489" style="s2">piagetian constraints in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.019" end="00:03:22.919" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re doing has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.489" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">support you while you&#39;re doing it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.919" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">constraint number one and that means</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:34.109" style="s2">that your your the path you take has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:38.250" style="s2">fulfill whatever constitute the list of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.109" end="00:03:40.379" style="s2">necessities that you can&#39;t move forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:43.650" style="s2">without and some of those we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.379" end="00:03:45.449" style="s2">basic needs like you have to breathe and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.650" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">you have to eat and you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.449" end="00:03:49.859" style="s2">sufficient you have to have sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:51.329" style="s2">water you have to have shelter and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.859" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">those things and there&#39;s a you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.329" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">parameters within which those needs can</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.069" style="s2">be fulfilled are pretty broad but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">know so you can&#39;t think of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.069" end="00:04:03.780" style="s2">necessarily as a simple problem or that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">there are simple solutions but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.780" end="00:04:09.019" style="s2">still obvious constraints and not only</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">do you have to fulfill all those</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.019" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">fundamental obligations to yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">you have to do it in a manner that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">relatively noncontradictory so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">while you&#39;re pursuing one it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.599" style="s2">decrease the chance that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">obtain another and you have to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.599" end="00:04:26.570" style="s2">a way that the way you do it now doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:29.030" style="s2">compromise you doing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.570" end="00:04:30.260" style="s2">next week or next month or next year</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.030" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2">that&#39;s where delay of gratification</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.260" end="00:04:35.960" style="s2">comes in and then you also have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:38.120" style="s2">in a way that fulfills your basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.960" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">in a non contradictory manner over</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.120" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">different spans of time and space while</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">other people are doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:48.020" style="s2">and so you think see that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">tight set of constraints and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.020" end="00:04:55.070" style="s2">that that that this narrative could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">anything is wrong because it it it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.070" end="00:04:59.750" style="s2">to serve many masters simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:02.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.750" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">solutions to that just like there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.360" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">multiple ways of playing or winning a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:14.180" style="s2">game but it&#39;s a constrained set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:15.620" style="s2">possibilities so okay now the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.180" end="00:05:17.660" style="s2">proposition is that when you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.620" end="00:05:20.780" style="s2">from point A to point B there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.660" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">basically there&#39;s two or three classes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.780" end="00:05:24.770" style="s2">of things that can happen one is things</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to have happen and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.770" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">that obviously is symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.390" style="s2">represented by the little blue unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">face and then there are positive things</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.390" end="00:05:37.180" style="s2">that can happen and the positive things</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:40.040" style="s2">are twofold in nature they have two</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.180" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">fundamental elements and behaviorists</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.040" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">never tell you this so it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:48.260" style="s2">fundamental flaws in behavioral theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.530" style="s2">things that indicate that you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.260" end="00:05:54.890" style="s2">towards a desired goal are positive</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.530" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">that&#39;s classic sophisticated behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.890" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">theory those are incentive rewards</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:00.920" style="s2">because an incentive reward indicates to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.850" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">you that a consuming Tory reward is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.920" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">forthcoming and there are different</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:06.350" style="s2">neurobiological systems that underlie</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:08.320" style="s2">those two types of reward consumed</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.350" end="00:06:11.270" style="s2">Ettore reward basically produces</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.320" end="00:06:13.550" style="s2">satisfaction whereas incentive reward</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.270" end="00:06:15.530" style="s2">produces excitement hope and movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.550" end="00:06:17.390" style="s2">forward and it&#39;s actually the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.530" end="00:06:19.370" style="s2">reward that you like better which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.390" end="00:06:21.770" style="s2">weird you know because you think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.370" end="00:06:24.290" style="s2">the most potent reward would be consumed</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.770" end="00:06:26.270" style="s2">Ettore reward but people will work</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.290" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">harder for incentive reward than they</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.270" end="00:06:29.630" style="s2">will for consuming Tory reward and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.630" end="00:06:34.430" style="s2">makes people very peculiar creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">I think part of the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:40.290" style="s2">that the incentive reward system is part</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:42.470" style="s2">of the broader seeking system</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.290" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">Jacque panksepp describes it and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.470" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">because the incentive reward system not</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">only tells you that a reward like an</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:55.170" style="s2">expected reward might be forthcoming it</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:58.350" style="s2">also tells you that an unexpected reward</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.170" end="00:06:59.730" style="s2">might be forthcoming and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.350" end="00:07:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s so important is because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.730" end="00:07:04.770" style="s2">actually view the world that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.920" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">understand partly through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.770" end="00:07:08.820" style="s2">threat because of something that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">don&#39;t understand happens it might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.820" end="00:07:13.020" style="s2">dangerous but also through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.030" style="s2">possibility because if something you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:17.160" style="s2">don&#39;t understand happens that means</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.030" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">there&#39;s an indeterminate probability of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.160" end="00:07:22.230" style="s2">reward and like these things turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:23.820" style="s2">be extremely important so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.230" end="00:07:26.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in a long-term sexual</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">relationship with a person the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.640" end="00:07:31.260" style="s2">which that relationship might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:32.610" style="s2">sexually pleasurable will decline and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.260" end="00:07:34.820" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.610" end="00:07:38.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s the novelty disappears</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">because novelty enhances incentive</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.700" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">reward and so one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:46.950" style="s2">can do to maintain the romance in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:48.870" style="s2">relationship is to mix some novelty and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.950" end="00:07:50.760" style="s2">however you might be able to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.870" end="00:07:52.410" style="s2">that usually involves playing in one</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.760" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">form or another and a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.410" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">creativity so it&#39;s not a trivial issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">it&#39;s an important issue so anyways when</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">when you&#39;re moving forward and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:04.770" style="s2">encounter something that indicates that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:06.450" style="s2">you&#39;re going to achieve your goal the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.770" end="00:08:08.790" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s happening at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.450" end="00:08:11.970" style="s2">time is that the fact that that thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.790" end="00:08:15.480" style="s2">appears validates your entire perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.970" end="00:08:18.660" style="s2">scheme right so a you&#39;re moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.480" end="00:08:20.370" style="s2">to the goal but B the whole plan that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.660" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">you&#39;re using to construe the world in</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.370" end="00:08:24.380" style="s2">order so that you can act so that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:26.610" style="s2">can move towards the goal is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.380" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">sufficiently right and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.610" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">source of incentive reward</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.060" end="00:08:42.630" style="s2">not only your conception of the present</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">but the whole framework itself your</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.630" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">conception of the present the future and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:09:19.830" style="s2">your choice about what behaviors to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:09:22.470" style="s2">implement yeah yeah okay yep yeah oh no</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.830" end="00:09:24.930" style="s2">definitely not as you move towards the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.470" end="00:09:26.790" style="s2">goal things you don&#39;t want and things</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.930" end="00:09:29.310" style="s2">you do want might be happening and like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.790" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">if something you don&#39;t want happens then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.310" end="00:09:36.360" style="s2">it depends on the it depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">relationship of the thing that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.360" end="00:09:40.380" style="s2">happen to your whole goal hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">the problem is and that&#39;s where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.380" end="00:09:45.140" style="s2">going to go next is when the unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">thing happens unless it&#39;s very simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.140" end="00:09:52.530" style="s2">which means that it can be modified here</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">and now with very little disruption then</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">it has an incalculable effect on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">integrity of the entire plan and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s why unexpected things in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:06.990" style="s2">particular are a class in of their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.030" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">now it&#39;s complicated a because normally</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.990" end="00:10:12.170" style="s2">when you&#39;re moving towards a goal if any</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">obstacle appears it&#39;s unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.170" end="00:10:16.260" style="s2">obviously because partly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:18.210" style="s2">trying to do when you lay out a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.260" end="00:10:21.330" style="s2">plan is to make sure that the pathway</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.210" end="00:10:23.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any obstacles in it so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.330" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">almost never encounter just like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.340" end="00:10:28.200" style="s2">never encounter an incentive reward</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">without also encountering a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.200" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">evidence that your plan is good you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:35.880" style="s2">never encounter an obstacle without also</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.840" end="00:10:39.060" style="s2">encountering evidence that your plan is</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.880" end="00:10:41.610" style="s2">flawed and then the question is well how</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.060" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">flawed and that&#39;s the big question and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.610" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s a third category of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.380" end="00:10:47.520" style="s2">events that occur as you&#39;re laying your</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">plans</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.520" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">as you&#39;re laying your plans out in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:54.360" style="s2">world and implementing them and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.550" style="s2">category is things you didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.360" end="00:11:00.330" style="s2">so not merely obstacles but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.550" end="00:11:03.000" style="s2">things you didn&#39;t expect so now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.330" end="00:11:04.850" style="s2">what this diagram basically indicates so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.000" end="00:11:07.140" style="s2">as you&#39;re moving from The Unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.850" end="00:11:08.580" style="s2">present it&#39;s unbearable because you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.140" end="00:11:10.080" style="s2">to make it better which is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.580" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">something to think about when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.080" end="00:11:14.280" style="s2">considering why human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:16.980" style="s2">constantly dissatisfied it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.280" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">if you weren&#39;t vaguely dissatisfied with</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:20.700" style="s2">the present you wouldn&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:22.740" style="s2">anything to try to change it into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.700" end="00:11:24.990" style="s2">future and so there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.740" end="00:11:27.630" style="s2">of vague dissatisfaction that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.990" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">a necessary motivator now you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.630" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">hope that there are times when you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:34.500" style="s2">things are good enough for right now so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">you can take a break from constantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.500" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">walking uphill but you can also see that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:42.600" style="s2">if you were completely satisfied we know</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">this from from animals like lions you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.600" end="00:11:46.380" style="s2">know after a kill all the Lions news lay</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.180" style="s2">around until they&#39;ve digested all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.380" end="00:11:50.580" style="s2">food you know and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">satisfied but it isn&#39;t obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.580" end="00:11:56.280" style="s2">case that that&#39;s the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:58.640" style="s2">strategy so as you&#39;re moving from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.280" end="00:12:01.140" style="s2">unbearable present to the desired future</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.640" end="00:12:04.020" style="s2">you can think that positive things</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.140" end="00:12:06.600" style="s2">happen so those facilitate your movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.020" end="00:12:08.460" style="s2">forward and negative things happen and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:11.880" style="s2">that interferes with your movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.460" end="00:12:12.870" style="s2">forward or you can think differently you</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.880" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">can which is a slight</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.870" end="00:12:17.250" style="s2">reconceptualization you can say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">predicted things happen and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.250" end="00:12:22.460" style="s2">unpredicted things happen so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:25.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a slightly different shift right</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.460" end="00:12:28.470" style="s2">because when you talk about unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.380" end="00:12:30.060" style="s2">and expected obviously you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.470" end="00:12:32.820" style="s2">referring to something that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.060" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">manifestation in the actual world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.820" end="00:12:37.140" style="s2">also a relationship that you have with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:40.140" style="s2">the thing in the world because expected</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.140" end="00:12:41.610" style="s2">means not only does it happen but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.140" end="00:12:43.320" style="s2">knew it was going to happen whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.610" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">unexpected means not only does it happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.320" end="00:12:46.590" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t know so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">subjective element and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.590" end="00:12:50.790" style="s2">change that another way to because and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:53.630" style="s2">this is I think the most accurate way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.790" end="00:12:58.380" style="s2">think about it which is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.630" end="00:13:00.360" style="s2">expected and unexpected it&#39;s desired and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.380" end="00:13:01.950" style="s2">undesired and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.360" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">there the utility in making that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.950" end="00:13:04.649" style="s2">transformation is it brings motivation</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">into the picture</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.649" end="00:13:11.730" style="s2">you&#39;re never only expecting or not</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.730" end="00:13:29.730" style="s2">yeah yes sort of if you lay out a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.010" end="00:13:31.769" style="s2">plan you may say well here&#39;s 10 things</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.730" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">that I don&#39;t want to have happen that a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.769" end="00:13:36.329" style="s2">relatively high probability and then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.790" style="s2">could build a little sub plan around</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.329" end="00:13:41.250" style="s2">each of those that constitutes a micro</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.790" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2">strategy within the plan but the way -</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:46.440" style="s2">the way to conceptualize that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">effectively is to think about this this</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.440" end="00:13:53.399" style="s2">isn&#39;t you don&#39;t have a plan ever you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:55.649" style="s2">have a nested series of plans and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.399" end="00:13:59.959" style="s2">operating at one level of that nested</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.649" end="00:14:03.390" style="s2">series at a time now if the if that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.959" end="00:14:06.360" style="s2">expected if it&#39;s an expected undesirable</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.390" end="00:14:08.699" style="s2">thing it usually affects a micro element</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.360" end="00:14:10.410" style="s2">of the plan right and so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.699" end="00:14:14.519" style="s2">change that and fix it without too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.410" end="00:14:18.510" style="s2">effort if it&#39;s a macro element you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.519" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say okay you fail of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.510" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">one thing another thing is east-european</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:28.050" style="s2">cyber criminals hijack your hard drive</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:30.810" style="s2">and encode it and they charge you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.050" end="00:14:32.430" style="s2">$10,000 to decode it and then you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:32.430" end="00:14:38.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well which of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.589" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">events is more serious well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.360" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">failing the exam is not a positive event</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:48.060" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a somewhat unexpected event</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.040" style="s2">likely if you were doing the work but it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.060" end="00:14:53.459" style="s2">doesn&#39;t blow apart your entire plan</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.040" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2">whereas the the the theft of all your</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.459" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">resources is a macro failure not only do</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:02.040" style="s2">you are you not getting from point A to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:04.260" style="s2">point B but the the framework within</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.260" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">B is wrong but it might even be worse</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:11.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a superordinate framework that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:13.550" style="s2">blows apart ten or eleven different</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.640" end="00:15:15.350" style="s2">plans so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.550" end="00:15:17.300" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s complicated because</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.350" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">things are never only predicted and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.300" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">unpredicted they&#39;re desired and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:23.180" style="s2">undesired and then they&#39;re desired and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.459" style="s2">undesired to different degrees and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.180" end="00:15:27.290" style="s2">degree depends on the place in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.459" end="00:15:30.140" style="s2">hierarchy where the unexpected thing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.290" end="00:15:31.730" style="s2">doing the disruption so but you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.140" end="00:15:34.970" style="s2">no way of getting towards that level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.730" end="00:15:36.770" style="s2">description without starting off as if</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.970" end="00:15:39.620" style="s2">you&#39;re only implementing one plan at a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.770" end="00:15:42.080" style="s2">time so this is a this is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.620" end="00:15:44.750" style="s2">oversimplification that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.080" end="00:15:46.610" style="s2">before we develop a sophisticated idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.750" end="00:15:50.830" style="s2">of of how it is that you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.610" end="00:15:53.890" style="s2">with the world okay so a desired outcome</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.830" end="00:15:57.649" style="s2">that&#39;s an incentive reward it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.890" end="00:16:00.680" style="s2">hopeful and positive and alert and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.649" end="00:16:03.290" style="s2">energetic and willing to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.680" end="00:16:05.000" style="s2">it&#39;s what you want it&#39;s what you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.290" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a dopaminergic reaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.000" end="00:16:09.380" style="s2">fundamentally whereas if something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:09.950" style="s2">you happen that happens that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.380" end="00:16:12.890" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.950" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">well that&#39;s both threatening technically</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.890" end="00:16:17.959" style="s2">because you it it indicates that a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:19.940" style="s2">punishment is likely and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.959" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">necessarily know the magnitude of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.940" end="00:16:25.820" style="s2">punishment and it&#39;s also punishing in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">and of itself so those are all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.820" end="00:16:29.450" style="s2">obviously a category that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">to have happen and the other problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.450" end="00:16:34.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to bind it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">look at it this way you have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.670" end="00:16:39.829" style="s2">relationship with someone and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:42.579" style="s2">of conflict Laden you know and you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.829" end="00:16:45.950" style="s2">each time you have a conflict you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.579" end="00:16:47.779" style="s2">should I be in this relationship well</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.950" end="00:16:50.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a big problem because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.779" end="00:16:53.029" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know how much conflict</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.300" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">should you have before you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.029" end="00:16:58.490" style="s2">in a relationship and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:17:00.170" style="s2">is well you don&#39;t know now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.490" end="00:17:02.329" style="s2">actually some empirical work on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.170" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">topic so I can give you a provisional</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.329" end="00:17:07.069" style="s2">answer which is quite interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">there was a research psychologist a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.069" end="00:17:11.650" style="s2">while back who I thought did a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:14.660" style="s2">study and they had couples record</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.650" end="00:17:16.520" style="s2">positive events just qualitatively how</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.660" end="00:17:18.770" style="s2">many positive interactions did you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.520" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">with your partner during the day versus</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.770" end="00:17:23.059" style="s2">how many negative interactions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:24.589" style="s2">think they quantified the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">which they were positive and negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.589" end="00:17:26.809" style="s2">they&#39;re just going to assume that across</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:29.690" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.809" end="00:17:31.610" style="s2">instances that would wash out and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.690" end="00:17:34.940" style="s2">they found was it&#39;s quite cool they</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.610" end="00:17:37.159" style="s2">found that if you had fewer than five</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:40.009" style="s2">positive interactions to every negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.159" end="00:17:42.980" style="s2">interaction the relationship was going</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.009" end="00:17:44.749" style="s2">to collapse so now you can start</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.980" end="00:17:46.879" style="s2">counting and see if that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.749" end="00:17:48.620" style="s2">to you but the other thing they found</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.879" end="00:17:50.179" style="s2">which I thought was really lovely was</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.620" end="00:17:52.159" style="s2">that if you had more than eleven</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.179" end="00:17:54.259" style="s2">positive interactions to one negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.159" end="00:17:57.169" style="s2">interaction the relationship was also</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.259" end="00:17:59.179" style="s2">doomed and so you think so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.169" end="00:18:00.860" style="s2">understand that right yet everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.179" end="00:18:02.539" style="s2">that because if someone&#39;s wandering</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.860" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">around treating you like a god too</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.539" end="00:18:06.230" style="s2">regardless the first thing you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:08.509" style="s2">to do is be just contemptuous of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.230" end="00:18:11.119" style="s2">and then completely bored you want the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.509" end="00:18:13.100" style="s2">person to harass you a bit just so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.119" end="00:18:14.840" style="s2">you learn something that&#39;s part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.100" end="00:18:16.460" style="s2">but so it&#39;s also evidence that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.840" end="00:18:18.769" style="s2">actually someone there that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.460" end="00:18:20.929" style="s2">interacting with you know because if</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.769" end="00:18:22.429" style="s2">someone just does everything you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.929" end="00:18:24.740" style="s2">all the time well I mean that might</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.429" end="00:18:26.059" style="s2">sound like an ideal fantasy but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.740" end="00:18:28.279" style="s2">perfectly well that if that ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.059" end="00:18:31.279" style="s2">happened that&#39;s just you&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.279" end="00:18:33.379" style="s2">get completely tired of that instantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.279" end="00:18:35.659" style="s2">plus there&#39;s no there&#39;s no life in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.379" end="00:18:44.809" style="s2">relationship right which is a big issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.659" end="00:18:46.429" style="s2">so yes right right right well exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.809" end="00:18:47.809" style="s2">well the other thing too is you can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.429" end="00:18:50.299" style="s2">sure that in a relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.809" end="00:18:54.200" style="s2">there&#39;s no conflict nothing is being</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.299" end="00:18:56.179" style="s2">decided because thought is conflict even</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.200" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">if you do it by yourself you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.179" end="00:18:59.119" style="s2">if there are two of you in a boat and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:01.009" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to decide where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.119" end="00:19:04.399" style="s2">going in the future it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.009" end="00:19:06.049" style="s2">self-evident there has to be some you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.399" end="00:19:07.279" style="s2">have to have an opinion and your partner</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.049" end="00:19:08.749" style="s2">has to have an opinion and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.279" end="00:19:10.700" style="s2">reason at all to assume that those</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.749" end="00:19:13.309" style="s2">opinions are there will be or should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.700" end="00:19:16.340" style="s2">the same and then you know you hope the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.309" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">relationship is solid enough so that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.340" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">can withstand the tension of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:21.080" style="s2">conflict one of the things you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">about marriage which I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.080" end="00:19:24.649" style="s2">because you can get a very nice job of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.049" style="s2">trying to understand from a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.649" end="00:19:28.879" style="s2">psychological perspective why in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.049" end="00:19:30.289" style="s2">world you should bother being married</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.879" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">which is really a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.289" end="00:19:35.330" style="s2">question you know and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:37.129" style="s2">one of the things he said was that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.330" end="00:19:38.179" style="s2">don&#39;t need to tie two things together if</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.129" end="00:19:39.909" style="s2">they&#39;ll just stay together</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.909" end="00:19:44.049" style="s2">the fact that marriage is a human</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.799" end="00:19:46.269" style="s2">Universal which it is indicates that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.049" end="00:19:48.249" style="s2">there is enough tension within intimate</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.249" end="00:19:52.479" style="s2">centrifugal tension to blow them apart</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.529" end="00:19:54.940" style="s2">and some of that&#39;s just because people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.479" end="00:19:57.429" style="s2">are different and they clash but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.940" end="00:19:59.619" style="s2">also because as you go through life in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.429" end="00:20:01.149" style="s2">single boat you encounter huge waves and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.619" end="00:20:03.940" style="s2">you know you might get swamped so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.149" end="00:20:07.469" style="s2">big problem his point was that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:14.229" style="s2">marriage vow was necessary because if</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.469" end="00:20:17.849" style="s2">your response to potential conflict was</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.229" end="00:20:21.129" style="s2">I can leave you can&#39;t have the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.849" end="00:20:23.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t have the conflict you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.129" end="00:20:25.239" style="s2">if on the other hand you&#39;re with someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.079" end="00:20:26.919" style="s2">and you think there&#39;s no bloody way I</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.919" end="00:20:31.929" style="s2">short of murder I&#39;m stuck with you for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.779" end="00:20:35.169" style="s2">the next 30 years then we better work</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.929" end="00:20:36.639" style="s2">this out and so that makes the he</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.169" end="00:20:39.009" style="s2">thought of that as a container within</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.639" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">which a transformation could take place</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.009" end="00:20:43.929" style="s2">it was no chemical motif and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:45.669" style="s2">without that pressure people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.929" end="00:20:49.029" style="s2">going to be sufficiently motivated to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.669" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">really hash out problems and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.029" end="00:20:52.899" style="s2">you can think of that think of that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.729" style="s2">whatever way you want but I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.899" end="00:20:56.729" style="s2">was an absolutely brilliant observation</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.099" end="00:21:06.279" style="s2">well the problem is it doesn&#39;t solve a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.599" end="00:21:09.009" style="s2">pro it doesn&#39;t solve any problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.279" end="00:21:12.339" style="s2">usually because for a variety of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.009" end="00:21:13.899" style="s2">one is it&#39;s probably you and not your</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.339" end="00:21:15.789" style="s2">partner anyways or at least there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.899" end="00:21:17.649" style="s2">50/50 chance and if it&#39;s you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.789" end="00:21:19.479" style="s2">gonna bring your stupidity to the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.649" end="00:21:22.209" style="s2">relationship and torture someone else to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.479" end="00:21:24.699" style="s2">death you know so that&#39;s a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.209" end="00:21:26.529" style="s2">the next problem is is that if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.699" end="00:21:27.909" style="s2">work out the bugs in this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.529" end="00:21:29.229" style="s2">why do you think you&#39;re going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.909" end="00:21:30.639" style="s2">to do it in the next relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.229" end="00:21:31.779" style="s2">especially now that you&#39;re older and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.639" end="00:21:35.079" style="s2">more set in your ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.779" end="00:21:35.889" style="s2">the third is well you know what about</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.079" end="00:21:38.769" style="s2">the kids</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.889" end="00:21:40.839" style="s2">the fourth is I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.769" end="00:21:43.389" style="s2">ever seen people in a protracted custody</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.839" end="00:21:45.069" style="s2">battle but if you want to ruin your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.389" end="00:21:46.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.069" end="00:21:49.209" style="s2">because that&#39;ll take you out for about</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.599" end="00:21:51.279" style="s2">15 years and it&#39;ll cost you pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.209" end="00:21:53.499" style="s2">all your money and it&#39;ll destroy your</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.279" end="00:21:54.070" style="s2">your closest relationships and I&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.499" end="00:21:55.690" style="s2">make it four</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.070" end="00:21:56.860" style="s2">actually impossible for you to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:21:58.390" style="s2">with the next person that you&#39;re with</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.860" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna be you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.390" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">burdened by this absolute catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">that&#39;s surrounding you with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:07.780" style="s2">how you organize your into relationships</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:09.670" style="s2">with the people that you love so so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.780" end="00:22:12.010" style="s2">generally speaking I don&#39;t think that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.670" end="00:22:14.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that it usually solves the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.010" end="00:22:15.970" style="s2">problem now it&#39;s sometimes it does but</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.350" end="00:22:17.620" style="s2">my sense is it&#39;s probably introduced</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.970" end="00:22:19.780" style="s2">more problems than it solves</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.620" end="00:22:22.750" style="s2">you know so I mean one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.780" end="00:22:24.970" style="s2">might note for example is that the only</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.750" end="00:22:27.460" style="s2">people who now get married are people</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.970" end="00:22:29.560" style="s2">who are relatively wealthy you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.460" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">fact that we&#39;ve disrupted the structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.560" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">of marriage as an institution since</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">about 1965 say what that&#39;s meant what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:39.010" style="s2">that has meant is that it&#39;s its benefits</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.380" style="s2">are now only available to people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.010" end="00:22:43.270" style="s2">were privileged so you can look up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.380" end="00:22:45.490" style="s2">stats yourself but if you&#39;re middle</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.270" end="00:22:48.670" style="s2">class and above the divorce rates</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.490" end="00:22:52.210" style="s2">haven&#39;t moved much since the early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.670" end="00:22:54.010" style="s2">if you&#39;re working class and below it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.210" end="00:22:57.310" style="s2">complete catastrophe and what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.010" end="00:23:01.030" style="s2">meant is that most many children who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.310" end="00:23:03.550" style="s2">in rougher socio-economic straights</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.030" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">are being raised by a single person who</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.550" end="00:23:09.040" style="s2">is absolutely and 100% overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:11.560" style="s2">their multiple commitments right</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.040" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">full-time responsibility for children</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.560" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">and generally in employment in an</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">extraordinarily dismal low-paying</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:22.150" style="s2">unstable and exploitative job so to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">if you if you&#39;re like you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.150" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">you&#39;re all gonna be middle class or</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:26.290" style="s2">above in all likelihood it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">fine for you it&#39;s not gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.290" end="00:23:29.920" style="s2">bloody bit of difference all things</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:35.970" style="s2">considered but for people who are poor</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.920" end="00:23:38.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just being a catastrophe so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.970" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.919" end="00:23:49.419" style="s2">oh wow there&#39;s all sorts of reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:52.269" style="s2">mean first of all it&#39;s become socially</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.419" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">acceptable right divorce wasn&#39;t socially</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.269" end="00:23:55.960" style="s2">acceptable and you can say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:23:57.519" style="s2">that was pretty hard on people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.960" end="00:24:00.279" style="s2">wanted to get divorced it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.519" end="00:24:01.899" style="s2">obviously any rule is hard on people</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.279" end="00:24:04.029" style="s2">that break it but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.899" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">there shouldn&#39;t be rules you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.029" end="00:24:09.239" style="s2">now what rules there should be that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:11.409" style="s2">whole different issue out of wedlock</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.239" end="00:24:15.100" style="s2">childbirth has become a norm</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.409" end="00:24:18.039" style="s2">it was absolutely rare in the 1919 60s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.100" end="00:24:20.499" style="s2">vanishingly rare and that&#39;s become it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.039" end="00:24:21.909" style="s2">it&#39;s acceptable even though all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.499" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">evidence suggests like if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.909" end="00:24:26.590" style="s2">look at the evidence it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.340" end="00:24:28.840" style="s2">clear that kids who have two parents do</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.590" end="00:24:30.700" style="s2">better than kids who have one now you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.840" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">know people when you tell people that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.700" end="00:24:34.029" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell you an anecdote about</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:35.739" style="s2">someone they knew maybe their own parent</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.029" end="00:24:38.019" style="s2">who did a wonderful job of raising them</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.739" end="00:24:39.369" style="s2">as a single person it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.019" end="00:24:41.169" style="s2">anecdotes are irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.369" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">what what&#39;s relevant is the bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.169" end="00:24:45.669" style="s2">evidence of course there are situations</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:47.559" style="s2">where people are better apart than</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.669" end="00:24:49.359" style="s2">together and of course there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.559" end="00:24:51.009" style="s2">situations where one person can do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.359" end="00:24:53.289" style="s2">better job than two people who were out</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.009" end="00:24:56.289" style="s2">each other&#39;s throats but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.289" end="00:24:58.029" style="s2">aggregate it&#39;s aggregating examples that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.289" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">you use when you&#39;re doing a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.029" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">survey and the results of those surveys</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">are crystal clear you know the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:05.830" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.210" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">to happen very soon is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.830" end="00:25:11.739" style="s2">going to be a very very very very large</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:16.629" style="s2">number of elderly people who are alone</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.739" end="00:25:19.179" style="s2">and being elderly and alone like no</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.629" end="00:25:20.470" style="s2">family that is not something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.179" end="00:25:21.700" style="s2">look forward to especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.470" end="00:25:24.999" style="s2">start thinking that you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.700" end="00:25:28.269" style="s2">elderly for like 40 years so you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.999" end="00:25:29.619" style="s2">because say say it starts around 65 I</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.269" end="00:25:32.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know how long you guys are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.619" end="00:25:34.269" style="s2">live but it&#39;s probably 95 is not an</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.289" end="00:25:36.639" style="s2">unreasonable estimate and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.269" end="00:25:38.499" style="s2">longer than that so because you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.639" end="00:25:42.759" style="s2">we&#39;re adding about three months to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.499" end="00:25:45.070" style="s2">total life span every year right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.759" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">the rate of technological improvement in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.070" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">relationship to overall mortality so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:51.770" style="s2">know and that the degree to which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:55.159" style="s2">adding that extra</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.770" end="00:25:57.649" style="s2">lifespan is increasing each year you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.159" end="00:25:59.510" style="s2">know and it may hit get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.649" end="00:26:01.789" style="s2">where we&#39;re increasing lifespan a year</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.510" end="00:26:03.620" style="s2">every year now I doubt it cuz it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.789" end="00:26:07.309" style="s2">probably eat it&#39;ll probably be in a city</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.620" end="00:26:09.500" style="s2">a sim tote but it has been increasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.309" end="00:26:12.919" style="s2">for a very long period of time so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.500" end="00:26:15.020" style="s2">know it&#39;s one thing to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.919" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">maximization of day to day freedom when</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.020" end="00:26:23.210" style="s2">you&#39;re between say 15 and and 4045 after</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:25.159" style="s2">that that&#39;s a whole different story and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.210" end="00:26:28.190" style="s2">but modern people never think about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.159" end="00:26:30.919" style="s2">last half of their life you know so why</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.190" end="00:26:35.419" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but maybe they&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.919" end="00:26:36.860" style="s2">too or something but okay so here the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.419" end="00:26:38.809" style="s2">other way of looking at it is when</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.860" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">you&#39;re no so there&#39;s lots of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.809" end="00:26:42.529" style="s2">conceptualizing what you encounter when</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.270" style="s2">you move into the world so we said well</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.529" end="00:26:45.559" style="s2">you know there&#39;s positive things you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.270" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">encounter negative things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.559" end="00:26:49.640" style="s2">expected things and unexpected things</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.470" style="s2">there&#39;s desired things and undesired</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.640" end="00:26:54.429" style="s2">things and another way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.470" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">it which is more in some sense it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.429" end="00:26:59.990" style="s2">empirical is that you encounter tools</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:02.149" style="s2">and obstacles right and tools move you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.990" end="00:27:03.980" style="s2">forward and tools are a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.149" end="00:27:05.690" style="s2">because they&#39;re sort of half objective</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.980" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">and half subjective right they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.690" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">thing but the thing is defined by their</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">use but weirdly enough we tend to define</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:17.419" style="s2">thing by use you know and I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.980" style="s2">this before so most people when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.419" end="00:27:21.710" style="s2">thinking about language think that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.980" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">use words to label things but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.710" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">much more likely that we use categories</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">as tools to act in the world and so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:31.970" style="s2">don&#39;t see things we see the use of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">things or the fact that they get in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.970" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:37.909" style="s2">and so you&#39;re trying to set up the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:40.309" style="s2">so that what surrounds you are entities</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.909" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">that you can use to get what you desire</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.309" end="00:27:44.450" style="s2">and to eliminate obstacles and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:46.429" style="s2">that&#39;s what you generally do if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.450" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">good manager right a big part of being a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.429" end="00:27:51.830" style="s2">good manager is to first of all lay out</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:53.960" style="s2">a plan for people that&#39;s hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.830" end="00:27:55.549" style="s2">and where the hierarchical levels don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:57.559" style="s2">conflict and the second thing is you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.549" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2">rid of obstacles for them so that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.559" end="00:28:01.100" style="s2">could come to you and say well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:02.840" style="s2">do this because this is in the way your</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.100" end="00:28:05.000" style="s2">job is to get it out of the way so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.840" end="00:28:05.660" style="s2">they can move forward so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.000" end="00:28:07.280" style="s2">good way of can</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.660" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">exceptional izing yourself as a manager</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.280" end="00:28:12.530" style="s2">so now part of there&#39;s obstacles that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:15.080" style="s2">you understand and those would</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.530" end="00:28:17.390" style="s2">correspond to the micro levels of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.080" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">hierarchy right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.390" end="00:28:20.540" style="s2">obstacles that you don&#39;t understand and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:24.350" style="s2">when they come up they just blow apart</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.540" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">your whole plan so now associated with</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.350" end="00:28:31.400" style="s2">that expected unexpected desired</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:34.060" style="s2">undesired tool obstacle is a corollary</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.400" end="00:28:37.430" style="s2">which is all the things that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.060" end="00:28:39.050" style="s2">conceptualizing as tools or obstacles or</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.430" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">as things you don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.050" end="00:28:43.640" style="s2">irrelevant and that&#39;s a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">thing to know because it means that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.640" end="00:28:48.470" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like the world is a sea of snakes</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.470" end="00:28:53.780" style="s2">and you&#39;re only concentrating on one</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">snake at a time but then if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.780" end="00:28:57.740" style="s2">mistake dealing with that single snake</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:29:00.050" style="s2">what happens is you&#39;re neck deep in</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.740" end="00:29:01.610" style="s2">snakes because all of the things the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.050" end="00:29:03.110" style="s2">thing is when you make a mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.610" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">this is a critical issue when you make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.110" end="00:29:07.430" style="s2">mistake and you blow the framework</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:09.350" style="s2">within which you&#39;re construing the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.430" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">the framework that narrows it for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.350" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">what happens is that all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:17.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve been ignoring become potentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:20.300" style="s2">relevant and that&#39;s overwhelming and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">that&#39;s partly why your body reacts as if</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.300" end="00:29:25.220" style="s2">it&#39;s under tremendous stress so for</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:26.840" style="s2">example you know how these things work</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.220" end="00:29:29.390" style="s2">and again I think betrayal is the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.840" end="00:29:32.840" style="s2">example if you have a partner and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.390" end="00:29:34.580" style="s2">betray you then all the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.840" end="00:29:36.400" style="s2">thought were true about the mark and all</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.580" end="00:29:38.870" style="s2">those things you ignored as irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.400" end="00:29:41.480" style="s2">turned out not to be irrelevant at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.870" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2">so you know maybe the person told you on</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.480" end="00:29:45.770" style="s2">a twice weekly basis that they were too</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.700" end="00:29:48.890" style="s2">busy studying to spend any time with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.770" end="00:29:52.340" style="s2">and you know you just put that down into</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.890" end="00:29:55.550" style="s2">the irrelevant zone after some coming to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.340" end="00:29:57.320" style="s2">terms with it and then you find out well</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.550" end="00:29:59.270" style="s2">that is what they were doing during that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.320" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">time and then the next question is well</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.270" end="00:30:03.590" style="s2">what else did they tell you that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:05.780" style="s2">the way it was and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.590" end="00:30:07.670" style="s2">could it be anything it means every</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.780" end="00:30:10.580" style="s2">single thing about your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.670" end="00:30:12.650" style="s2">past present and future has now been</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.580" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">cast into the realm of potential</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.650" end="00:30:17.480" style="s2">relevance and almost all the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:19.490" style="s2">is negative and that&#39;s the descent into</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.480" end="00:30:21.290" style="s2">chaos so that&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.490" end="00:30:23.900" style="s2">conceptualize chaos is because what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.290" end="00:30:26.270" style="s2">happens is that your plan is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:28.760" style="s2">narrows the world for you and constrains</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.270" end="00:30:30.950" style="s2">it makes most of it irrelevant the parts</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.760" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">that aren&#39;t relevant positive and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:35.510" style="s2">negative elements relatively rare that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:38.630" style="s2">what the intact hierarchical plan does</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.510" end="00:30:40.280" style="s2">if you blow the hierarchical plan then</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.630" end="00:30:42.470" style="s2">all your nice little subdivisions are</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.280" end="00:30:45.020" style="s2">now irrelevant and every little monster</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.470" end="00:30:47.720" style="s2">comes up to face you and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.020" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">descent into the underworld right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.720" end="00:30:51.860" style="s2">people do not like that and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">the reason they don&#39;t like that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.860" end="00:30:58.070" style="s2">because it places them in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:31:00.679" style="s2">that&#39;s so complex that it could easily</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.070" end="00:31:02.030" style="s2">exceed their resources you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.679" end="00:31:04.010" style="s2">for example one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.030" end="00:31:06.380" style="s2">happens to elderly people sometimes this</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.010" end="00:31:07.940" style="s2">isn&#39;t precisely a betrayal is you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.380" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">they&#39;ve been with someone for 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.940" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">and the person dies well the probability</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:15.110" style="s2">that the partner will die in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:17.510" style="s2">following year is much elevated compared</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.110" end="00:31:20.270" style="s2">to their normal mortality and part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.510" end="00:31:22.760" style="s2">that is they they just it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.270" end="00:31:26.900" style="s2">they&#39;re grieving exactly although they</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.760" end="00:31:29.030" style="s2">are what&#39;s happened is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.900" end="00:31:31.880" style="s2">fundamental axioms of the structures</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.030" end="00:31:35.030" style="s2">that they use to encapsulate the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.880" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">has been blown out and everything comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.030" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">crashing down and so sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:42.950" style="s2">just don&#39;t have the resources to make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:44.510" style="s2">through that they&#39;re just done you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.950" end="00:31:46.670" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.510" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">pieces and start again you know and at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.670" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">some point maybe god only knows at some</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:53.179" style="s2">point maybe that&#39;s not what you do like</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:55.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what you do after you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.179" end="00:31:57.410" style="s2">married 75 years and your partner dies I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.550" end="00:31:59.630" style="s2">mean maybe you have a party if it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.410" end="00:32:02.120" style="s2">an absolutely dreadful marriage but but</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.630" end="00:32:05.179" style="s2">in all likelihood you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.120" end="00:32:07.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like a stroke that leaves you with</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.370" end="00:32:11.140" style="s2">you can recover from it so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.760" end="00:32:21.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question but I would say</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.700" end="00:32:28.290" style="s2">think what happens is that the framework</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:32.160" style="s2">breaks and then the person is cast into</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.410" end="00:33:03.240" style="s2">weakness that&#39;s lower than others but</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:05.520" style="s2">generally if I push hard enough on you</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.780" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">as a psychological phenomena but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.270" end="00:34:14.669" style="s2">not really a psychological phenomena</p>

<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:38.119" style="s2">that has to do with subjective factors</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.119" end="00:34:50.059" style="s2">familial and social factors so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.309" end="00:34:52.039" style="s2">I&#39;ve construed normally as normal or</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.810" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">the same day it would be something like</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:29.360" style="s2">well is that psychological it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.120" end="00:36:31.370" style="s2">I would say not really there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.370" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">not be as well prepared for a bout of an</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:43.370" style="s2">but if I have someone in my as a client</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.250" end="00:36:45.350" style="s2">who&#39;s depressed and unemployed what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.370" end="00:36:47.150" style="s2">try to do is treat the unemployment not</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.150" end="00:36:50.900" style="s2">they gonna do you know how can you not</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:52.730" style="s2">be depressed when you&#39;re looking at a</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.390" end="00:37:01.420" style="s2">like that&#39;s it&#39;s not exactly a</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.589" end="00:37:14.679" style="s2">yeah well I mean one of the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like being able to move</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.679" end="00:37:18.939" style="s2">on your feet so let&#39;s say well let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.650" end="00:37:20.799" style="s2">you want to have it you the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.939" end="00:37:22.719" style="s2">question is can you have a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.799" end="00:37:25.150" style="s2">life right because we&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.719" end="00:37:28.299" style="s2">from the proposition that unvarnished</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.150" end="00:37:29.619" style="s2">life is very dismal and dreadful right</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.299" end="00:37:31.269" style="s2">so if you&#39;re not prepared for it we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.619" end="00:37:33.519" style="s2">just grind you up and that will be very</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.269" end="00:37:35.319" style="s2">painful okay so we&#39;re gonna use that as</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.319" end="00:37:39.189" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be secure and happy the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.150" end="00:37:40.809" style="s2">baseline is there isn&#39;t much of you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.189" end="00:37:41.890" style="s2">you&#39;re very fragile and things will</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.890" end="00:37:45.759" style="s2">that&#39;s a Buddhist stance right because</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.809" end="00:37:48.759" style="s2">the Buddhists say first dictum of</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.549" end="00:38:49.779" style="s2">of those I would like the top one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.650" end="00:38:52.749" style="s2">those I would say is probably alcoholism</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.779" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">so if there&#39;s one thing you really want</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.749" end="00:38:57.429" style="s2">to avoid that screws up your life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:39:00.549" style="s2">drinking too much it is unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.429" end="00:39:03.189" style="s2">dangerous so so the first thing we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.549" end="00:39:06.669" style="s2">say is well let&#39;s optimize those well</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.189" end="00:39:08.859" style="s2">the more you optimize those the more the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.669" end="00:39:11.769" style="s2">more pillars there are in your plan and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.859" end="00:39:14.289" style="s2">they&#39;re only somewhat correlated so</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.769" end="00:39:16.539" style="s2">maybe you can lose one or maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.289" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">even lose two it&#39;s going to knock you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.539" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">down but it&#39;s not going to sink</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.849" style="s2">you you know and then you might also</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:23.410" style="s2">want to have variants on those plans to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.849" end="00:39:25.990" style="s2">some degree so like one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.410" end="00:39:28.599" style="s2">mentioned earlier is that it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.990" end="00:39:33.099" style="s2">nice to have an an alternative to your</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.599" end="00:39:34.809" style="s2">current job at hand because it stops you</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.099" end="00:39:36.910" style="s2">from being vulnerable it also stops you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.809" end="00:39:38.410" style="s2">from being a slave or a victim or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.910" end="00:39:40.390" style="s2">even stops you from being a tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.410" end="00:39:45.630" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got some choice</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.390" end="00:39:49.240" style="s2">so you diversify your your hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.630" end="00:39:50.680" style="s2">plans essentially just like you do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.240" end="00:39:52.180" style="s2">can think about it as stock market</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.680" end="00:39:54.250" style="s2">investing in some sense it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.180" end="00:39:56.230" style="s2">analogous idea you don&#39;t put all your</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.250" end="00:39:59.380" style="s2">eggs in the same basket you diversify</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.230" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">across multiple portfolios so if one</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.380" end="00:40:03.849" style="s2">sector gets knocked out hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:07.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t knock you completely out of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.849" end="00:40:09.430" style="s2">game so so and that&#39;s partly what guide</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.930" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">you through in the in the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.430" end="00:40:13.630" style="s2">authoring program - because it asks you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:16.690" style="s2">to consider what I think are the main</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.630" end="00:40:18.309" style="s2">six dimensions of your life you know and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.690" end="00:40:21.220" style="s2">so one of the things I do when a client</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.309" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">comes is I just do a rough walkthrough</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.220" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">of those dimensions it&#39;s like does</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:27.940" style="s2">anybody care if you&#39;re alive or dead you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:29.049" style="s2">know so do you have any friends do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.940" end="00:40:30.579" style="s2">have anybody that loves you do you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.049" end="00:40:32.770" style="s2">an intimate relationship however things</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.579" end="00:40:34.630" style="s2">going with your family do you have a job</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.770" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">are you as educated as you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.630" end="00:40:37.780" style="s2">intelligent do you have any room for</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:39.430" style="s2">advancement in the future do you do</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.780" end="00:40:41.530" style="s2">anything interesting outside of your job</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.430" end="00:40:44.619" style="s2">and if the answer to all those is no</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.530" end="00:40:48.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re not depressed</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.619" end="00:40:51.069" style="s2">my friend you just are screwed really</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.760" end="00:40:53.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like if someone like someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.069" end="00:40:54.700" style="s2">to me and they&#39;re 40 and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.230" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">issue especially if they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.700" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">drinking it&#39;s like Humpty Dumpty has hit</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:03.670" style="s2">the floor and no one is going to put the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:05.799" style="s2">pieces together because it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.670" end="00:41:07.180" style="s2">too much it&#39;s too much people you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.799" end="00:41:09.069" style="s2">what I mean it takes a whole lifetime to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.180" end="00:41:10.809" style="s2">put those things together that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.069" end="00:41:13.420" style="s2">site that might have started as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.809" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">psychological problem but by the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.420" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s fully manifest in your 40 that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:20.040" style="s2">not a psychological problem it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:20.040" style="s2">complete catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.160" end="00:41:28.359" style="s2">well I think sometimes antidepressants</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.080" end="00:41:30.630" style="s2">help and the reason they help is because</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.359" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">they actually buffer the stress response</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.630" end="00:41:34.599" style="s2">so you know you&#39;re being ground down by</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:36.760" style="s2">the world because essentially what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.599" end="00:41:39.160" style="s2">are is you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re not even in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.760" end="00:41:40.450" style="s2">the dominance hierarchy you&#39;re solo in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.160" end="00:41:41.730" style="s2">the dominance hierarchy that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.450" end="00:41:44.619" style="s2">even in it right you&#39;re an outcast</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.730" end="00:41:47.230" style="s2">fundamentally so maybe buffering the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.619" end="00:41:50.140" style="s2">stress response will help the person</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.230" end="00:41:52.810" style="s2">just not die from that and then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.140" end="00:41:56.619" style="s2">start with one thing you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.810" end="00:41:59.290" style="s2">you you lay out the potential areas for</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.619" end="00:42:01.150" style="s2">approval improvement on the table and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.290" end="00:42:02.980" style="s2">you say well can we think of some small</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:06.040" style="s2">steps that you might take in one or more</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.980" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">of those domains to start putting</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.040" end="00:42:12.430" style="s2">something solid underneath your feet but</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:16.150" style="s2">it&#39;s what happens I think is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.430" end="00:42:18.630" style="s2">lose those pillars the way that problems</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.150" end="00:42:22.270" style="s2">manifested themselves in your life</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.630" end="00:42:24.820" style="s2">becomes networked and so you might make</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.270" end="00:42:26.349" style="s2">progress here but some other catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.820" end="00:42:31.650" style="s2">that&#39;s looming over here is going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.349" end="00:42:31.650" style="s2">knock you down you know so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.930" end="00:42:48.500" style="s2">no it means that your your better</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.580" end="00:42:50.330" style="s2">protected against being dreadfully</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.500" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">miserable and swamped than you would</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.330" end="00:42:55.250" style="s2">otherwise be so I would say you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.720" end="00:42:57.550" style="s2">do those things before you can even</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.250" end="00:43:00.380" style="s2">address the issue of being happy right</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.550" end="00:43:03.770" style="s2">because if if you don&#39;t have if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.380" end="00:43:06.110" style="s2">haven&#39;t establish yourself in one or one</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.770" end="00:43:08.450" style="s2">or two of those domains say there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.110" end="00:43:10.490" style="s2">obvious things that you could do to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.450" end="00:43:13.430" style="s2">decrease the degree to which your life</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.490" end="00:43:14.870" style="s2">is negative that you haven&#39;t yet done so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.430" end="00:43:16.580" style="s2">I would say you shouldn&#39;t even get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.870" end="00:43:18.650" style="s2">the existential problem before you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.580" end="00:43:20.570" style="s2">solved the practical problems and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.650" end="00:43:22.910" style="s2">may find that if you solve the practical</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.570" end="00:43:26.420" style="s2">problems the existential problems would</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.910" end="00:43:27.590" style="s2">become bearable now not necessarily you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.420" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">know because I might say well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.590" end="00:43:32.570" style="s2">another class of people and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:35.570" style="s2">this is one of the pathologies of being</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.570" end="00:43:38.360" style="s2">creative so if you&#39;re a high open person</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.570" end="00:43:40.520" style="s2">and you have all those things that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.360" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">going to be enough you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.520" end="00:43:45.020" style="s2">to pick another domain where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:48.620" style="s2">working on something that&#39;s positive and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.020" end="00:43:51.380" style="s2">somewhat revolutionary because like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.620" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">creative impulse is for someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.380" end="00:43:55.010" style="s2">open we know it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:56.330" style="s2">personality dimension and I&#39;ve watched I</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.010" end="00:43:58.700" style="s2">have clients who are very high in</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.330" end="00:44:00.410" style="s2">openness and others who aren&#39;t and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.700" end="00:44:03.740" style="s2">the ones who are high in openness aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.410" end="00:44:06.320" style="s2">doing something creative then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.740" end="00:44:10.550" style="s2">like dead sticks there they can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.320" end="00:44:11.930" style="s2">properly so so you know that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.550" end="00:44:14.900" style="s2">those are the people for example who</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.930" end="00:44:16.610" style="s2">benefit particularly from depths of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.900" end="00:44:18.830" style="s2">psychological approaches especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.610" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">Union approaches I think that all of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.830" end="00:44:23.990" style="s2">clients were high in openness because</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:26.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched my clients I&#39;ll try Union</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.990" end="00:44:28.370" style="s2">ideas out on them and if they&#39;re high in</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.090" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">openness they work like a charm</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.370" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">it just fits right in with their psyche</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:34.220" style="s2">but if they&#39;re conservative people</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:35.960" style="s2">fundamentally conservative people Lo and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.220" end="00:44:39.830" style="s2">openness and high in conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.960" end="00:44:41.780" style="s2">they it just doesn&#39;t click because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.830" end="00:44:43.670" style="s2">Union approach is aesthetic and creative</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.780" end="00:44:46.520" style="s2">and and lots of people aren&#39;t either of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.670" end="00:44:49.390" style="s2">those things so there was another</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.520" end="00:44:49.390" style="s2">question yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.950" end="00:44:55.029" style="s2">yeah but they fight especially if your</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.229" end="00:44:56.979" style="s2">orderly you know because</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.029" end="00:44:59.920" style="s2">conscientiousness is partly orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.979" end="00:45:03.670" style="s2">and partly openness Hitler was like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.920" end="00:45:05.589" style="s2">he was extremely orderly and extremely</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.670" end="00:45:07.390" style="s2">high in openness and one of the ways he</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.589" end="00:45:09.130" style="s2">solved that problems which was quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.390" end="00:45:11.049" style="s2">interesting is that whenever there were</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.130" end="00:45:13.150" style="s2">art exhibit submissions in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.049" end="00:45:15.430" style="s2">there were two types there is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.150" end="00:45:19.660" style="s2">approved Nazi art which was very</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.430" end="00:45:22.359" style="s2">structured and conventional and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.660" end="00:45:24.579" style="s2">bordered on the propagandistic and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.359" end="00:45:26.680" style="s2">was forbidden art which was really</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.579" end="00:45:28.719" style="s2">chaotic and like often it was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.680" end="00:45:30.819" style="s2">expressionist stuff for example which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.719" end="00:45:33.309" style="s2">really emotionally expressive but</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.819" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">chaotic and Hitler would have both</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.309" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">exhibitions going on at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.769" style="s2">and one of them would be forbidden and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:41.249" style="s2">the other would be approved you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.769" end="00:45:43.539" style="s2">but the problem with orderliness is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.249" end="00:45:46.869" style="s2">you want everything to be in its</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.539" end="00:45:49.450" style="s2">category and no wonder we&#39;ve described</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.869" end="00:45:51.190" style="s2">why that is but if you&#39;re open you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.450" end="00:45:52.569" style="s2">always thinking well maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.190" end="00:45:56.019" style="s2">better way of putting those things in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.569" end="00:45:58.269" style="s2">category and that&#39;s a that&#39;s tough so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.019" end="00:46:01.710" style="s2">orderly open people are always at odds</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.269" end="00:46:01.710" style="s2">with themselves you know so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.530" end="00:46:18.470" style="s2">yeah yeah well people like that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.710" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">often extremely successful right right</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.470" end="00:46:22.130" style="s2">and it looks like industriousness is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:24.650" style="s2">part of conscientiousness that predicts</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.130" end="00:46:27.740" style="s2">long-term life success and orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.650" end="00:46:30.290" style="s2">is the part that predicts conservative</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.740" end="00:46:31.910" style="s2">political attitudes but low openness is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.290" end="00:46:41.630" style="s2">also associated with conservative</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.910" end="00:46:44.750" style="s2">political attitudes so okay so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.630" end="00:46:47.030" style="s2">the descent into the underworld that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.750" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">basically what occurs it can occur at</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.030" end="00:46:52.220" style="s2">any level of your plant right from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.260" style="s2">macro levels to the micro levels and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.220" end="00:46:56.540" style="s2">what happens is that it&#39;s a descent into</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.260" end="00:46:59.000" style="s2">chaos if the unexpected thing is big</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.540" end="00:47:01.190" style="s2">enough to invalidate the framework that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.000" end="00:47:04.250" style="s2">you&#39;re using to deal with the world at</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.190" end="00:47:06.020" style="s2">that moment got it and then the degree</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.250" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">to which you feel negative emotion is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.020" end="00:47:11.810" style="s2">proportionate to the importance of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:14.090" style="s2">plan to the organization of your</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.810" end="00:47:16.700" style="s2">perception and action so you could think</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.090" end="00:47:18.620" style="s2">about it as a you could think about what</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.700" end="00:47:20.570" style="s2">you bring to bear on the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.620" end="00:47:23.210" style="s2">almost like you can think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.570" end="00:47:25.160" style="s2">how Google Maps manages it you know how</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.210" end="00:47:28.070" style="s2">you can take Google Maps and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.160" end="00:47:30.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a cybernetic intelligence right the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.070" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">whole GPS search process because you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.350" end="00:47:35.930" style="s2">I&#39;m here and I&#39;m going there and then it</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.880" style="s2">maps a route out for you and if you go</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.930" end="00:47:39.350" style="s2">off route it goes through a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.880" end="00:47:40.220" style="s2">period of chaos and then it finds</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.350" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">another route</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.220" end="00:47:45.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s really an intelligent system but</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:48.140" style="s2">you notice that Google Maps is scalable</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.260" end="00:47:51.320" style="s2">so you can look at probably if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.140" end="00:47:54.530" style="s2">going from here to Mississauga using a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.320" end="00:47:56.600" style="s2">map of Canada is the wrong map right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.530" end="00:47:58.670" style="s2">want to scale the thing down until you</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.600" end="00:48:01.640" style="s2">hit the level of resolution that both</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.670" end="00:48:03.290" style="s2">that best represents the situation so</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.640" end="00:48:05.330" style="s2">that you can move to where you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.290" end="00:48:09.050" style="s2">go you can scale up and down in it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.330" end="00:48:10.820" style="s2">so finding out that the entire country</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.050" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">has been destroyed by nuclear bombs is</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.820" end="00:48:15.590" style="s2">going to be a much bigger catastrophe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:17.090" style="s2">relationship to your plan than finding</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.590" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">out that there&#39;s a few obstacles in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.090" end="00:48:23.510" style="s2">street on your way to Mississauga that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">haven&#39;t been marked on the map and so so</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.510" end="00:48:26.420" style="s2">anyway so you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.610" style="s2">much more upset when the entire</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.420" end="00:48:30.650" style="s2">superordinate that the low-resolution</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.610" end="00:48:32.690" style="s2">plans are disrupted then when the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.650" end="00:48:36.350" style="s2">high-resolution plans are disrupted and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.690" end="00:48:37.820" style="s2">that&#39;s partly how your mind part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.350" end="00:48:39.620" style="s2">problem we&#39;re trying to solve here is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.820" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">how upset should you be when something</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.620" end="00:48:44.450" style="s2">you don&#39;t want happens and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:47.240" style="s2">that is that&#39;s virtually impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.450" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">compute but then the problem is you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.240" end="00:48:50.270" style="s2">to compute it because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:52.730" style="s2">you&#39;ll burn yourself out with stress and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.270" end="00:48:54.320" style="s2">worry and and that&#39;s not psychological</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.730" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">that&#39;ll just kill you because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.320" end="00:48:58.670" style="s2">actually a physic cycle physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:00.830" style="s2">damaging process so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.670" end="00:49:03.350" style="s2">constrain it and so here are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.830" end="00:49:04.940" style="s2">ways that you constrain it one you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.350" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">born with a baseline level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.940" end="00:49:09.380" style="s2">neuroticism so if you&#39;re higher in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:10.820" style="s2">neuroticism you&#39;re going to think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.380" end="00:49:13.430" style="s2">smaller things are more catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.820" end="00:49:15.980" style="s2">than someone who&#39;s lower in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.430" end="00:49:18.260" style="s2">and you might say well who&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.980" end="00:49:20.870" style="s2">the answer is it depends completely on</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.260" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">the situation and it&#39;s random it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.870" end="00:49:23.690" style="s2">fundamentally random and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:27.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.690" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">on average we would say the typical</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.260" end="00:49:32.300" style="s2">person is matched to the typical</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:33.470" style="s2">environment but sometimes the terrified</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.300" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">people are going to be right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.470" end="00:49:36.230" style="s2">sometimes the people that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">bother no matter what you do are going</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.230" end="00:49:42.290" style="s2">to be right okay so that&#39;s one its</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:44.930" style="s2">crapshoot the second is where are you in</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.290" end="00:49:46.010" style="s2">a dominance hierarchy because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.930" end="00:49:49.100" style="s2">things your brain is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.010" end="00:49:51.020" style="s2">understand is how should you regard</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.100" end="00:49:52.850" style="s2">yourself as an active and competent</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.020" end="00:49:55.820" style="s2">organism when you&#39;re facing problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.850" end="00:49:57.640" style="s2">that you can&#39;t compute and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.820" end="00:50:00.080" style="s2">that is we&#39;re not going to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.640" end="00:50:01.910" style="s2">we&#39;re going to distribute the problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.080" end="00:50:04.580" style="s2">into the social network and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.910" end="00:50:06.470" style="s2">to let everyone else solve it and so if</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.580" end="00:50:09.530" style="s2">you rise up in the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.470" end="00:50:11.330" style="s2">your brain reacts as if the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.530" end="00:50:13.600" style="s2">hierarchy structure which is composed of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.330" end="00:50:15.890" style="s2">many many brains has run its</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.600" end="00:50:17.990" style="s2">computations and decided that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.890" end="00:50:19.820" style="s2">pretty damn competent and so the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.990" end="00:50:21.740" style="s2">your brain responds to that is it cranks</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.820" end="00:50:24.410" style="s2">up your serotonin production and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:26.420" style="s2">decreases your neuroticism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.410" end="00:50:29.000" style="s2">perfectly reasonable computation because</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.420" end="00:50:30.950" style="s2">a if everybody says you&#39;re competent</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.000" end="00:50:32.750" style="s2">you&#39;re competent enough so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.950" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">going to get more rewarded for your</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.750" end="00:50:36.140" style="s2">competence than other people are and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:38.330" style="s2">that&#39;s going to make you more secure in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.140" end="00:50:40.310" style="s2">your job that&#39;s going to make you more</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.330" end="00:50:42.080" style="s2">Herbal and in demand among other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.310" end="00:50:44.990" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to give you access to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.080" end="00:50:49.100" style="s2">resources you wouldn&#39;t otherwise have so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.990" end="00:50:50.870" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s a correlated</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.100" end="00:50:52.760" style="s2">element to that which is sort of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.870" end="00:50:54.860" style="s2">level of self esteem although that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.760" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">very much associated with with</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.860" end="00:50:59.570" style="s2">neuroticism people with high self esteem</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:01.370" style="s2">generally have low levels of negative</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.570" end="00:51:05.180" style="s2">emotion it&#39;s not it&#39;s not clear that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.370" end="00:51:07.750" style="s2">those are separable phenomena all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.180" end="00:51:10.700" style="s2">what time is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.750" end="00:51:14.660" style="s2">2:45 all right well let&#39;s stop for 10</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.700" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">minutes okay and we&#39;ll yeah let&#39;s stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.660" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">for 10 minutes</p>
