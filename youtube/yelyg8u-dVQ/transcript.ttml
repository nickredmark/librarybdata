<p begin="00:00:07.160" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">what seems to be going on pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">reliably so far is finding relationships</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:19.850" style="s2">of complementarity at an mutual</p>

<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">or destroy on that that I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.310" end="00:00:30.810" style="s2">not only what we&#39;re talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:32.910" style="s2">the exemplification of how we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.810" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">and how we&#39;re entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.910" end="00:00:37.649" style="s2">relationship how are we we are reap</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">writer or we&#39;re reprioritizing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.649" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">moving off of the product and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:45.469" style="s2">position and trying to really move into</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">process and participation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.469" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s always been very</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">important to me because as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">aspire towards the Socratic ideal but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:01:00.350" style="s2">that is now even more so the case for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">because I see that ability to enact</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.350" end="00:01:05.330" style="s2">functional as opposed to dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">and adaptive as opposed to maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.330" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">collective intelligence and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">into something like collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">rationality so that it can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:17.159" style="s2">so that we can effectively aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">collective rationality and wisdom um</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">that has become has become very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">central to me and like so that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:28.860" style="s2">process of all this discussion over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">last year meeting all of you guys and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.860" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">women and then engaging in the work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">the after Socrates project cuz all has</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">just it has intensified and very</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">dramatically deep and it was already</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">deep I believe but is it intensified and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">dramatically deepened my commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">the Socratic ideal of deal logos that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">has now become um sort of very very I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">would say that sacred to me and the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">I talk about in this series right okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">if you&#39;ve already breached on some</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">aren&#39;t breached you&#39;ve already touched</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">on some of the things that we were going</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">to discuss sure the first being</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">rationality and so you said you said</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">collective rationality yeah oh so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">seem to be an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:16.799" style="s2">and dial logos so so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">difference between just ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.799" end="00:02:24.269" style="s2">rationality and and let&#39;s say collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:29.159" style="s2">rationality and dialogue and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.269" end="00:02:30.269" style="s2">goes right so let&#39;s let&#39;s well let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.159" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">it first what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.269" end="00:02:34.920" style="s2">sort of ordinary or comp the common</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">right good notion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.920" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">there and the notion I&#39;m arguing for and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do that sort of individually</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">because that will give me an analogic</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:47.569" style="s2">basis for them talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:50.310" style="s2">collective it is that okay great yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.569" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">typically and I know this because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.310" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">teach I teach on rationality and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">get to see people&#39;s and these are right</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">educated young people they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">so they&#39;re sort of the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:02.909" style="s2">representative representative of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">call folk psychology so within the COG</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.909" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">SCI academic world folk psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">the psychological the implicit largely</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">implicit psychological theories that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">most people are carrying around so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">people have theories implicit theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">about intelligence about rationality</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">right right right and it&#39;s folk</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:19.109" style="s2">psychology they haven&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">theories about how memory works they</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.109" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">have implicit theories about what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">concepts are the now one thing we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:28.829" style="s2">put on the table right away</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">is and this is what I got a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.829" end="00:03:33.329" style="s2">doing in introduction to cog sign is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:35.099" style="s2">most of those folks psychological</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.329" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">intuitions have turned out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.099" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">but they have turned out to be very</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:43.650" style="s2">wrong and for a kind of important reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">right so so let&#39;s say you know our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.650" end="00:03:48.599" style="s2">about rationality or ideas about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:51.329" style="s2">yeah or your ideas about intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.599" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">you know all of them are very distorted</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.329" end="00:03:59.010" style="s2">or a very yep yeah very very skewed are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">these about memory let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.010" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">example for commemorat because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">far enough away from our topic that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:05.549" style="s2">be a little less controversial a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2">a little easier to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.549" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2">establish so many people we have all</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:12.389" style="s2">these metaphors in fact that to speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">this we think of memory as like like</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.389" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">like a room in which we store things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:19.139" style="s2">we go in there and we retrieve it and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">search through our memory and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.139" end="00:04:23.039" style="s2">metaphor we have is kind of like we like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">a library and we&#39;re sending people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.039" end="00:04:27.599" style="s2">and they&#39;re moving around and why</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">and this kit brings me to the point I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.599" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">wanted to make we have these folks</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:33.749" style="s2">psychological notions because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:36.840" style="s2">remember that in our folk psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.749" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">context we are not primarily interested</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.840" end="00:04:42.449" style="s2">in explaining phenomena we&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:44.610" style="s2">in primarily predicting and training so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.449" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">right there&#39;s a language of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">in a language of the training okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:50.219" style="s2">here&#39;s what I want to say if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:52.650" style="s2">train your memory it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.219" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">thing to use that idea of a room right</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.650" end="00:04:56.550" style="s2">here&#39;s a this is you see it on Sherlock</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">right you have your you have your memory</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">palace or your mind Palace right you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:01.469" style="s2">have this room it&#39;s called the method of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">low side and it let&#39;s say I&#39;m gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.469" end="00:05:06.659" style="s2">to Andrew and I first talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:08.039" style="s2">rationality so you know III get a room I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.659" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">like a space maybe this house that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.039" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">in I&#39;m Phil you&#39;re familiar with it the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">library is where I&#39;m gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:14.939" style="s2">Andrew but rationality so form an image</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:16.439" style="s2">of you in the library and there&#39;s books</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.939" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s knowledge and alright right</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.439" end="00:05:19.770" style="s2">and then and then I&#39;m not going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.180" end="00:05:21.210" style="s2">to you know Andrew perhaps about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.770" end="00:05:23.669" style="s2">transformation well that&#39;s the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.210" end="00:05:25.529" style="s2">on a picture Andrew in the kitchen and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.669" end="00:05:27.029" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s doing and so what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.529" end="00:05:28.409" style="s2">make all these images and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.029" end="00:05:30.089" style="s2">different places and what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.409" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">actually search I go from room to room</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.089" end="00:05:34.650" style="s2">to room in my mind this is a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:36.419" style="s2">way to train memory the the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">orders could use this technique to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.419" end="00:05:40.650" style="s2">memorize speeches that will last like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">six hours so it&#39;s really powerful way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.650" end="00:05:45.839" style="s2">train your memory and it goes very well</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">with all those metaphors the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.839" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">our memory doesn&#39;t work like that at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:52.110" style="s2">that&#39;s good language for training it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:55.169" style="s2">you you don&#39;t actually have that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:05:58.229" style="s2">you know search cereal search because</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.169" end="00:06:02.219" style="s2">for example can you please tell me</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.229" end="00:06:04.349" style="s2">Justin Bieber&#39;s phone number mmm no no</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.219" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know it no you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:08.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t scroll through all of your phone</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">numbers and realize that it wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:14.219" style="s2">you just know is that like a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:16.169" style="s2">or something or well no there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.219" end="00:06:18.029" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that it&#39;s there&#39;s a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.169" end="00:06:20.159" style="s2">there&#39;s also a kind of parallel search</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.029" end="00:06:22.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of memory probably in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.159" end="00:06:26.039" style="s2">neural networks as opposed to located</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.409" end="00:06:27.990" style="s2">memory like in standard computers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.039" end="00:06:29.969" style="s2">you know and your memories aren&#39;t stable</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.990" end="00:06:32.009" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly reconstructing them</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.969" end="00:06:34.259" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly rewriting them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.009" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">why confident I listen it alright</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.259" end="00:06:38.190" style="s2">confident eyewitness testimony</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:38.630" style="s2">forty-nine percent of it is inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.190" end="00:06:41.090" style="s2">forty</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.630" end="00:06:42.890" style="s2">9% of it is wrong huh right because</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.090" end="00:06:44.600" style="s2">confidence measures how meaningful you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.890" end="00:06:48.110" style="s2">find the experience not how accurate</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.600" end="00:06:51.040" style="s2">that it is or you know we think you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.110" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">in a library things that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.040" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">that are relevant to each other are</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:57.740" style="s2">stored close to each other but like in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:06:59.510" style="s2">your memory if I give you a vice a color</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.740" end="00:07:03.160" style="s2">red say another color as quickly as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.510" end="00:07:08.600" style="s2">can so red red okay or say another color</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.160" end="00:07:12.410" style="s2">red blue okay now give me a a word that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.600" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">rhymes with blue true okay so red is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.410" end="00:07:20.660" style="s2">close to blue and blue as close to true</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:24.050" style="s2">is red close to true no no memory so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.660" end="00:07:26.900" style="s2">although we talk about memory I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.050" end="00:07:28.790" style="s2">training with that and it seems so</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.900" end="00:07:31.070" style="s2">intuitive to us that that must be how</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.790" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">memory works and that&#39;s not how memory</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.070" end="00:07:35.750" style="s2">actually works you see that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:37.850" style="s2">to show you just in these sort of Pony</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.750" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">eat you know dog and pony examples that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.850" end="00:07:43.100" style="s2">your memory doesn&#39;t actually work that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:45.320" style="s2">way in fact it&#39;s taken us a long and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.100" end="00:07:47.480" style="s2">attention doesn&#39;t work just like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:49.670" style="s2">spotlight and all kinds of yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.480" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">jumping ahead to say that this is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.670" end="00:07:55.190" style="s2">you mean about wisdom to write is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">for yourself deception right or are</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.190" end="00:08:00.230" style="s2">these these forms can leave their lead</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:02.300" style="s2">to self-deception or they can lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.230" end="00:08:04.370" style="s2">greater understanding that depending how</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.300" end="00:08:06.980" style="s2">we use them or how transparent they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.370" end="00:08:07.700" style="s2">to us right so though what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.980" end="00:08:10.550" style="s2">get at</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.700" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">yes I that&#39;s I think a very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.550" end="00:08:15.230" style="s2">way of reframing what I&#39;m saying if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:17.180" style="s2">don&#39;t pay attention to the difference</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.230" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">between our folk psychological language</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.180" end="00:08:22.670" style="s2">of training and our scientific language</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:25.820" style="s2">of explaining we can equivocate we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.670" end="00:08:28.130" style="s2">confuse them together and thereby deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.820" end="00:08:29.750" style="s2">deceive ourselves now I and get into all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:33.289" style="s2">kinds of New Age nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.750" end="00:08:37.520" style="s2">well a mule Age nonsense but also we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.289" end="00:08:39.140" style="s2">could fail to more powerfully even use</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:42.500" style="s2">our memory when we&#39;re studying for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.140" end="00:08:44.180" style="s2">test so so people think well the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.500" end="00:08:45.590" style="s2">way to study for a test to sort of read</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.180" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">the material over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.590" end="00:08:49.640" style="s2">rehearse it because it&#39;s like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:51.670" style="s2">you know writing over and over again on</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">the same spot in the library to make it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.670" end="00:08:55.510" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the best way to try and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">study for a test for example because</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.510" end="00:08:59.590" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually using your memory</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:02.140" style="s2">for how it actually functions oh can I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.590" end="00:09:03.970" style="s2">can I just do a slight aside here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:06.760" style="s2">because this is fascinating to me I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.970" end="00:09:08.650" style="s2">talking to Zach Stein recently Geno&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.760" end="00:09:10.660" style="s2">act you know yeah if I could I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.650" end="00:09:15.730" style="s2">talked yes yeah he&#39;s a brilliant guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.660" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">anyway told me that his that he&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.730" end="00:09:21.250" style="s2">achieving dyslexic yes and he described</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:23.770" style="s2">his mind and it seemed to be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.250" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">similar to mine and I&#39;m pretty sure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.770" end="00:09:29.860" style="s2">I have the same thing that he has oh you</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.330" style="s2">read the paragraph first and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.860" end="00:09:33.310" style="s2">read the sentence and then you read the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.330" end="00:09:34.960" style="s2">word you don&#39;t read from the word up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.310" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">the paragraph like you know you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.960" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">in the Gestalt and then it&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:43.420" style="s2">you have to get to the to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">feature right yeah so an ordinary mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.420" end="00:09:46.630" style="s2">kind of for most I shouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:48.490" style="s2">ordinary because nobody has an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.630" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">mind but most people kind of build up</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.490" end="00:09:52.810" style="s2">from from maybe the feature to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.700" style="s2">gestalt and then a person who has it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.810" end="00:09:56.140" style="s2">sort of has that kind of dyslexia it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.700" end="00:09:58.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t read or anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.140" end="00:10:00.910" style="s2">they just kind of do things in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.540" end="00:10:03.730" style="s2">different you know different way you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.910" end="00:10:06.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a little it&#39;s a it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.730" end="00:10:09.190" style="s2">more complicated everybody I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.310" end="00:10:10.090" style="s2">everybody actually simultaneously again</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.190" end="00:10:11.740" style="s2">because you&#39;re not doing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.090" end="00:10:14.350" style="s2">step-by-step the way we think in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.740" end="00:10:16.270" style="s2">language yeah here&#39;s you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.350" end="00:10:17.590" style="s2">why we had to get neural networks to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.270" end="00:10:21.270" style="s2">solve what&#39;s called the chicken and egg</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.590" end="00:10:23.620" style="s2">problem because when I&#39;m reading I to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.270" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">read the letters in order to read the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.620" end="00:10:26.650" style="s2">word but I need to know what the word is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:28.450" style="s2">in order to disambiguate the letters</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.650" end="00:10:30.100" style="s2">so you&#39;re spontaneously going from</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.450" end="00:10:32.200" style="s2">feature to Gestalt and Gestalt to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.100" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">feature sure right so it&#39;s in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.200" end="00:10:35.950" style="s2">again which is not something that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">to put into words right it&#39;s kind it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.950" end="00:10:38.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go well with sort of again a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:39.580" style="s2">folk psychological understanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.890" end="00:10:41.050" style="s2">we do things</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.580" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">but it&#39;s modeled well than neural</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.050" end="00:10:45.550" style="s2">networks for example now the thing is of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:49.060" style="s2">course everybody&#39;s sort of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.550" end="00:10:50.530" style="s2">but there is variation on wit like how</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.060" end="00:10:52.860" style="s2">it&#39;s skewed some people more skewed</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.530" end="00:10:59.530" style="s2">equally some people are more skewed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.860" end="00:11:00.910" style="s2">Gestalt II yeah so my main point of all</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.530" end="00:11:03.010" style="s2">of this and thank you because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.910" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">helped me sort of explicate my point</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.010" end="00:11:09.100" style="s2">right in this discussion we&#39;ve just had</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:12.300" style="s2">is we have to be willing to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.100" end="00:11:15.970" style="s2">our folk psychological notions</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.300" end="00:11:19.420" style="s2">rationality yeah because there&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.970" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very plausible that like all of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.420" end="00:11:24.100" style="s2">other folks psychological constructs</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.160" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">well it has some important truths to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.100" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">it also has a lot of misrepresentation</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:32.139" style="s2">and misdirection with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:33.880" style="s2">phenomenon mm-hmm and so why that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.139" end="00:11:37.029" style="s2">little bit more challenging for us I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.880" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">think is is that you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.029" end="00:11:41.949" style="s2">have sort of a memory that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:43.510" style="s2">great it&#39;s a little bit affects your</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.949" end="00:11:44.920" style="s2">sort of status and your self-esteem a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.510" end="00:11:48.420" style="s2">little bit but you know I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.920" end="00:11:51.070" style="s2">much but these terms intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.420" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">rationality and wisdom they carry with</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.070" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">them a tremendous aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">cognition very very powerful so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:02.649" style="s2">why people get very very sort of about</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:05.880" style="s2">notions of intelligence rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.649" end="00:12:10.269" style="s2">wisdom so again we need to pull apart</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.880" end="00:12:12.250" style="s2">write our identification with these</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.269" end="00:12:13.959" style="s2">processes which of course we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.250" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">address it eventually but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.959" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">pull that apart from our attempt to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">our best understanding of them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">again our eye dentist like all of our a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.010" style="s2">lot of our my side biases and our</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">egocentric bias our identification with</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.010" end="00:12:27.930" style="s2">these processes can actually deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:30.640" style="s2">impede us getting a good understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.930" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">of them I needed to say all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.640" end="00:12:34.870" style="s2">precisely uncurls I want to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:38.589" style="s2">choose standard notions of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.870" end="00:12:41.350" style="s2">be rational okay go for it okay so one</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.589" end="00:12:43.300" style="s2">notion of what rationality is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.350" end="00:12:45.250" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the Spock version for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.300" end="00:12:47.829" style="s2">FRA for those of you you and I have that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.250" end="00:12:51.610" style="s2">generation we know right this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.829" end="00:12:53.949" style="s2">that rationality is logic ality and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.610" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">see this in you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.949" end="00:12:57.970" style="s2">sort of online forums that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the model of rationality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">rationality is to be as logical as</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:08.949" style="s2">possible and mr. Spock sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:13.810" style="s2">exemplified that and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.949" end="00:13:16.510" style="s2">that is it we have to we have to set it</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.810" end="00:13:18.510" style="s2">into an overarching idea that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.510" end="00:13:20.370" style="s2">we&#39;re goal-directed</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.510" end="00:13:22.410" style="s2">we&#39;re seeking goals we&#39;re seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.370" end="00:13:24.149" style="s2">achieve goals and so one thing we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.410" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">to note is that what rationality means</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.149" end="00:13:28.199" style="s2">method as a method for us is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:29.880" style="s2">looking for the most reliable and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.199" end="00:13:33.290" style="s2">systematic way of achieving our goals</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.880" end="00:13:35.339" style="s2">right so you say wow but that&#39;s flying</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.290" end="00:13:37.050" style="s2">logic is the most reliable and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.339" end="00:13:39.510" style="s2">systematic way of achieving truth the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.050" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">problem with that is it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.510" end="00:13:44.339" style="s2">not because logic isn&#39;t relative</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.139" style="s2">relevant to rationality but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.339" end="00:13:47.250" style="s2">identify about snotty with logic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.139" end="00:13:49.709" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.250" end="00:13:53.070" style="s2">logic works in terms of certainty and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.709" end="00:13:55.110" style="s2">completely formal system mm-hmm and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.070" end="00:13:56.910" style="s2">that means and I&#39;m trying not to try not</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.110" end="00:13:58.260" style="s2">to presuppose too much be presumptuous</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.910" end="00:14:00.089" style="s2">of what people have seen other series</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.260" end="00:14:04.889" style="s2">but what that means is you basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.089" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">into a kind of processing that has to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.889" end="00:14:09.329" style="s2">check all of the problem space it has to</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:16.350" style="s2">to be comprehensive and exhaustive you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.370" end="00:14:17.790" style="s2">have to be kind of like a machine of</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.790" end="00:14:22.470" style="s2">but nobody can do that like even or even</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.380" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">problem of search is is it still the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:34.440" style="s2">profound problem is that it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.010" end="00:14:36.750" style="s2">just too much too much information too</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.440" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">much so if you and everybody knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.750" end="00:14:40.589" style="s2">is this who was working within</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">rationality Herbert and Simon you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.589" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">think was was it Simon&#39;s book I think it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.540" end="00:14:46.610" style="s2">was a Newell and Simon or Simon&#39;s book I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:50.310" style="s2">think bounded rationality their</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.610" end="00:14:52.260" style="s2">rationality is always bounded in terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.310" end="00:14:54.600" style="s2">of what&#39;s actually possible for us</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.260" end="00:14:57.630" style="s2">Chania talked about we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.600" end="00:15:00.569" style="s2">finitary predicament and this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.630" end="00:15:02.339" style="s2">the core of my work we can&#39;t reason we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.569" end="00:15:04.440" style="s2">can&#39;t make inferences on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.339" end="00:15:06.269" style="s2">all possible options all possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.440" end="00:15:08.579" style="s2">probability or all possible information</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.269" end="00:15:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s common entirely explosive so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.579" end="00:15:12.510" style="s2">we do is we bound it we zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.500" end="00:15:15.329" style="s2">what&#39;s salient you knew I was gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.510" end="00:15:17.819" style="s2">this then relevant then what&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.329" end="00:15:23.459" style="s2">and so that means before you can even</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.819" end="00:15:26.100" style="s2">use logic you have to have pre logical</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.459" end="00:15:27.449" style="s2">processes of problem formulation the</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">because they prevent you from being</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">they constitute you being a viable</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:46.020" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be sick the neck the next</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.020" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">and a tutorial explosion and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.220" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">committed cognitive suicide mm-hmm so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">for dreaming or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:56.580" style="s2">you know a dream is is we don&#39;t normally</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">think of a dream as being rational it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:00.960" style="s2">could be but it could it could have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.540" style="s2">rational function or I could have yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.960" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">what do you mean well more than that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.540" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">mean I I think that what you see is but</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">one plausible account of what dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">does is it&#39;s a kind of optimization</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:17.130" style="s2">process on how your brain is operating</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:19.140" style="s2">mm-hm and so it&#39;s not so much the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.130" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">content of the dream but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.140" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">the way in which your brain is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:26.190" style="s2">practicing getting better adjusting what</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:28.890" style="s2">it finds salient and relevant so it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.190" end="00:16:30.600" style="s2">weird variations on patterns that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.890" end="00:16:32.790" style="s2">sort of acquired through the day and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.600" end="00:16:34.590" style="s2">sees which one of those sort of optimize</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.790" end="00:16:35.910" style="s2">its ability to track and predict and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.590" end="00:16:38.339" style="s2">solve problems that&#39;s where you&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.910" end="00:16:40.710" style="s2">solving your problems in your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.339" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">right right here right and so and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.710" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">that looks all sort of create it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">illogical but it could turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.060" end="00:16:49.230" style="s2">rational because it could be actually</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:54.270" style="s2">especially and here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.770" end="00:16:57.390" style="s2">come back if it systematically and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.270" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2">reliably improves your ability to zero</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.390" end="00:17:01.050" style="s2">in on relevant information and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:02.760" style="s2">going to add something to that that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.050" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">directly implied by that it</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:13.920" style="s2">then I think that&#39;s how we should</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.860" end="00:17:15.530" style="s2">understand rationality well rational</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.920" end="00:17:18.569" style="s2">practice is a practice that</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:37.139" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got to change what I find</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:39.779" style="s2">relevant and salient and that means if</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.139" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">we have an account of rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.779" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">which insight does not play a central</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:46.950" style="s2">role we do not have a good account of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:49.799" style="s2">insight because the machinery of insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.950" end="00:18:52.620" style="s2">is the machinery by which you optimize</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.799" end="00:18:54.330" style="s2">your ability to zero in an information</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.620" end="00:18:57.179" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same machinery you use to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.330" end="00:19:01.799" style="s2">overcome self-deception mm-hmm so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.179" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">problem with that with the with the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.799" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">idea of it just being intelligent is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:09.720" style="s2">rationality so intelligence is what</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:11.549" style="s2">you&#39;re using well there&#39;s a lot of if I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.720" end="00:19:15.510" style="s2">could just there&#39;s a lot of very stupid</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.549" end="00:19:17.549" style="s2">intelligent people right they have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.510" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">machineries all there but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.549" end="00:19:21.779" style="s2">using it correctly or that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">they&#39;re not using it in an optimized way</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.779" end="00:19:28.679" style="s2">or in a and let&#39;s say essica way or in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:30.840" style="s2">or or an on self-delusional way right</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.679" end="00:19:32.610" style="s2">okay right and said that&#39;s exactly my</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.840" end="00:19:34.679" style="s2">point Andrew they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.610" end="00:19:36.840" style="s2">your you use your intelligence to solve</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.679" end="00:19:39.539" style="s2">your problems but that can generate all</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:42.149" style="s2">kinds of skewed salience landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.539" end="00:19:44.130" style="s2">capacities for acting immorally</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.149" end="00:19:47.279" style="s2">for acting in a self deceptive manner</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.130" end="00:19:49.799" style="s2">rationality is what you use in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.279" end="00:19:52.440" style="s2">deal with all of that right all of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.799" end="00:19:54.690" style="s2">if you&#39;ve side effects generated by</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.440" end="00:19:57.210" style="s2">using your intelligence in an adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.690" end="00:20:00.539" style="s2">manner so rationality is is is if</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.210" end="00:20:02.490" style="s2">practice rather than something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.539" end="00:20:04.590" style="s2">just born with and oh yes no no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.490" end="00:20:08.580" style="s2">not that&#39;s very important to think to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.590" end="00:20:10.440" style="s2">know that right that one and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.580" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">said it was aspirational right it&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:19.500" style="s2">yes become a rational person even though</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:21.390" style="s2">it seems like an ideal like it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.500" end="00:20:24.779" style="s2">very likely scenario that you would</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.390" end="00:20:27.480" style="s2">become 100 percent rational yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.779" end="00:20:29.250" style="s2">I I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.480" end="00:20:31.580" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t yeah I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.250" end="00:20:34.679" style="s2">know that&#39;s the correct way to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.580" end="00:20:37.110" style="s2">because it it brings with it a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.679" end="00:20:39.750" style="s2">an idea of completeness or finality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.110" end="00:20:41.490" style="s2">because your relevance really because</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.750" end="00:20:43.860" style="s2">your intelligence is a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.490" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">evolving dynamical system and because</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:47.730" style="s2">the world is a self-organizing dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">system there&#39;s no there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.730" end="00:20:52.529" style="s2">final state you can get into we can say</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:56.450" style="s2">where you can pronounce now I am forever</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.529" end="00:20:58.980" style="s2">free from all process sort of it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.450" end="00:21:00.390" style="s2">process well this is this is how I</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.980" end="00:21:01.770" style="s2">interpret the first noble truth of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.390" end="00:21:03.330" style="s2">Buddhism I&#39;m not a Buddhism look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.770" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">even though you know Alexander says I am</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.330" end="00:21:09.210" style="s2">but right all right because but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:10.740" style="s2">interpret it as you know not that all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.210" end="00:21:13.169" style="s2">life is suffering is that makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.740" end="00:21:15.260" style="s2">but that no matter where you turn there</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.169" end="00:21:18.570" style="s2">is no place in which you can be free</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.260" end="00:21:20.399" style="s2">from the threat of self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.570" end="00:21:23.100" style="s2">self-destructive behavior no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.399" end="00:21:24.809" style="s2">smart you are no matter how intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.100" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">you are yeah you missed something</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.809" end="00:21:29.669" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you you&#39;d always have a blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:32.850" style="s2">spot somewhere oh I have a lot of blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.669" end="00:21:34.169" style="s2">spots so you know you take a look a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.850" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">of psychology&#39;s going through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.169" end="00:21:37.649" style="s2">replication crisis results aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">getting replicated well you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.649" end="00:21:41.669" style="s2">robustly getting replicated time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.929" end="00:21:43.770" style="s2">time again all this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.669" end="00:21:46.020" style="s2">cognitive bias all this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.770" end="00:21:48.029" style="s2">self-deception all this stuff about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.020" end="00:21:50.309" style="s2">intelligence is necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.029" end="00:21:53.340" style="s2">sufficient for rationality all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.309" end="00:21:55.260" style="s2">is very very robust it is not going</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.340" end="00:21:56.909" style="s2">through the road application crisis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.260" end="00:21:58.770" style="s2">an aspect of our cognition that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.909" end="00:22:01.590" style="s2">should have very strong confidence that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.770" end="00:22:03.210" style="s2">which means given these two points we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.590" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">should not think of rationality as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.210" end="00:22:08.700" style="s2">identical to either logic ality or</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:09.540" style="s2">either to our intelligence up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.700" end="00:22:11.490" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.540" end="00:22:13.590" style="s2">innately given problem-solving capacity</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.490" end="00:22:16.140" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.590" end="00:22:17.790" style="s2">intelligence is and and and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.140" end="00:22:20.010" style="s2">this would actually ameliorate a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.790" end="00:22:22.440" style="s2">useless debates people don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.010" end="00:22:23.970" style="s2">idea you know that IQ is fixed because</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.440" end="00:22:25.980" style="s2">then they think they&#39;re doomed right</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.970" end="00:22:27.690" style="s2">they think oh no right because you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.980" end="00:22:31.980" style="s2">and then there&#39;s all these objections</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.690" end="00:22:33.540" style="s2">and right and but and this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.980" end="00:22:35.070" style="s2">this is an argument I get from stand a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.540" end="00:22:37.650" style="s2">bitch we shouldn&#39;t be caring so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.070" end="00:22:40.110" style="s2">about intelligence and yeah G is a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.650" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">predictor it&#39;s one of our best measures</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.110" end="00:22:43.080" style="s2">of general intelligence you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:45.210" style="s2">should all I really care about about you</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.080" end="00:22:47.190" style="s2">a rational you are yeah because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.210" end="00:22:50.250" style="s2">gonna predict how moral you behave how</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.190" end="00:22:52.740" style="s2">how how you can overcome ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.250" end="00:22:54.630" style="s2">how you&#39;re less self-deceptive like an</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.740" end="00:22:58.410" style="s2">your mud truck like what about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:23:01.710" style="s2">effective world right because I was you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.410" end="00:23:03.060" style="s2">know I was thinking about how how when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.710" end="00:23:06.030" style="s2">was talking to you last night</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.060" end="00:23:08.820" style="s2">he kind of lives in that kind of a realm</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.030" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s very rational as well but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.820" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t swim in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:18.690" style="s2">rational arguments he he kind of swims</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:21.030" style="s2">in something else or or well but again I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.690" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">guess I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m still I still have</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.030" end="00:23:25.320" style="s2">this narrow definition of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">when I know but that&#39;s but that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.320" end="00:23:31.650" style="s2">what you just that&#39;s a beautiful segue</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">for me because the the so I&#39;ve two ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.650" end="00:23:35.220" style="s2">in which are the folk psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">notion is to narrow it either identify</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.220" end="00:23:39.450" style="s2">and it often does it both in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:41.250" style="s2">contradictory manner but it often</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.450" end="00:23:44.280" style="s2">identifies rationality with being</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.250" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">intelligent yeah right and right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.280" end="00:23:48.120" style="s2">therefore fix like intelligence but no</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not rationality is not intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.120" end="00:23:52.110" style="s2">and rationality is developmental you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.520" end="00:23:54.510" style="s2">get better and better at matter you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.110" end="00:23:57.000" style="s2">conspire and it&#39;s not equivalent to rat</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.510" end="00:23:59.700" style="s2">to logic ality just being good at logic</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.000" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">is not it&#39;s evidence is clear it does</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.700" end="00:24:04.170" style="s2">not make you very rational actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:05.850" style="s2">rationality is about knowing where when</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.170" end="00:24:07.920" style="s2">it&#39;s about rate rationing it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.850" end="00:24:10.500" style="s2">knowing where when and to what degree to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.920" end="00:24:11.910" style="s2">be logical you know this brings what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.500" end="00:24:13.920" style="s2">just said brings me up to the third way</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.910" end="00:24:15.750" style="s2">and the folk psychological notion are is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.920" end="00:24:18.620" style="s2">not cross culturally but ours in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.750" end="00:24:20.940" style="s2">West is deficient is we limit</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.620" end="00:24:23.640" style="s2">rationality to just inferential</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.940" end="00:24:26.160" style="s2">processes about belief</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.640" end="00:24:27.540" style="s2">they say oh we limited a job to use some</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.160" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">of Mines from a knowledge do we limit</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.540" end="00:24:33.030" style="s2">rationality jus just propositional</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">knowing and that with a goal the sole</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.030" end="00:24:38.010" style="s2">goal of rationality is to get true</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.020" style="s2">beliefs which of course is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.010" end="00:24:41.490" style="s2">I could get in you know an indefinitely</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.929" end="00:30:41.870" style="s2">psychological and then there&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.160" end="00:30:44.750" style="s2">who&#39;s a sophist and he has this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.870" end="00:30:46.820" style="s2">technical sort of logical definition</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:49.090" style="s2">right that he&#39;s heard from somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:52.610" style="s2">right and Socrates rejects both of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.090" end="00:30:54.890" style="s2">and and and then you get to the end and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.610" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no conclusion as to what courage</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.890" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">is other than the fact that these two</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:01.850" style="s2">approaches have been shown to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.950" style="s2">inadequate but what you see is both of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.850" end="00:31:04.810" style="s2">the generals say they want their sons to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.950" end="00:31:06.790" style="s2">come and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.810" end="00:31:11.250" style="s2">from Socrates to spend time with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.790" end="00:31:13.930" style="s2">Socrates because that the process maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.250" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2">because maybe perhaps courage is is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.930" end="00:31:17.680" style="s2">something that you can define it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:19.570" style="s2">something that it&#39;s it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.680" end="00:31:22.120" style="s2">you you could define in any absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:23.680" style="s2">sense no and maybe think about Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.120" end="00:31:27.370" style="s2">inand and what he taught when he talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.680" end="00:31:29.080" style="s2">about thinking and how concepts a true</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.370" end="00:31:31.450" style="s2">concept is something that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.080" end="00:31:33.580" style="s2">any kind of finitude to it it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.450" end="00:31:36.820" style="s2">reveals itself more and more over time</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.580" end="00:31:39.040" style="s2">more and more truth over time and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.820" end="00:31:42.160" style="s2">and and you can&#39;t ever pin pin it down</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.040" end="00:31:43.330" style="s2">or that&#39;s what I&#39;d let goes back to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.160" end="00:31:44.830" style="s2">I was saying earlier about you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.330" end="00:31:47.680" style="s2">get away from models that seek</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.830" end="00:31:49.510" style="s2">completeness and I mean the initiative</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.680" end="00:31:52.090" style="s2">thing and I think that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.510" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">right so Socrates the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.090" end="00:31:55.180" style="s2">dialogue is you have to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:57.550" style="s2">this is why Plato writes dialogues as</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.180" end="00:31:59.980" style="s2">opposed to just straight arguments the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.550" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">point is the you you can&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.980" end="00:32:03.880" style="s2">definition of courage but as you watch</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.870" end="00:32:06.160" style="s2">Socrates move between these two</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.880" end="00:32:08.380" style="s2">positions the skill ax and Charybdis of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.160" end="00:32:12.130" style="s2">going along you get a sense of how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.380" end="00:32:14.560" style="s2">get on the track how to aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.130" end="00:32:17.260" style="s2">courage and that Socrates is reliably</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.560" end="00:32:19.810" style="s2">honest so you develop a kind of trust in</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.260" end="00:32:22.060" style="s2">following Socrates because he has</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.810" end="00:32:27.160" style="s2">exemplified even though he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.060" end="00:32:29.140" style="s2">explicate courage mm-hmm so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.160" end="00:32:30.970" style="s2">that I would like to bring into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.140" end="00:32:34.420" style="s2">current practices like guys circling is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.970" end="00:32:37.300" style="s2">to not always just be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.420" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">the process but also to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.300" end="00:32:43.420" style="s2">look on what we&#39;re exemplifying in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">process so like you know encircling</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.420" end="00:32:47.560" style="s2">you&#39;re doing all these things to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:50.050" style="s2">maintain the flow of the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.560" end="00:32:51.460" style="s2">cognition mm-hmm and everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.050" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">feeling that it&#39;s very meaningful but</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.460" end="00:32:55.540" style="s2">whatever you step back and say yep but</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:57.580" style="s2">what is meaning what is meaning in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.540" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">situation what and not just abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.580" end="00:33:01.750" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got the phenomenology as</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:03.070" style="s2">active its engaged and you have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:04.840" style="s2">people there that have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.070" end="00:33:06.400" style="s2">perspectives on it and you can start</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.840" end="00:33:07.960" style="s2">doing something like a Socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.400" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">well what is it to be meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.960" end="00:33:12.010" style="s2">connected and then and then what you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.140" style="s2">do is check with you know are we still</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.010" end="00:33:16.090" style="s2">exemplifying the phenomena we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.140" end="00:33:18.149" style="s2">to explicate it&#39;s not even just a new</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.090" end="00:33:19.559" style="s2">you try to keep the two by</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.149" end="00:33:21.749" style="s2">tightly coupled together so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.559" end="00:33:23.189" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly moving Chris Master</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.749" end="00:33:25.379" style="s2">Pietro and I talked about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.189" end="00:33:27.299" style="s2">chapter we wrote on dr. logos you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.379" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">constantly sort of you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.299" end="00:33:30.809" style="s2">constant moving but in an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.969" style="s2">fashion between fear theory and theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.809" end="00:33:35.029" style="s2">abut ween you know theorizing and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.969" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">going back and really theory really</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.029" end="00:33:41.069" style="s2">loosing it out and yeah yeah yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:44.969" style="s2">extremely experienced in it in action</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.069" end="00:33:48.689" style="s2">mmm-hmm and so rationality again is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.969" end="00:33:52.099" style="s2">would be for collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.689" end="00:33:58.849" style="s2">would be to try and find systematic and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.099" end="00:34:01.979" style="s2">reliable ways of getting that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.849" end="00:34:05.579" style="s2">pattern of communication and connection</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.979" end="00:34:07.169" style="s2">between people in place hmm very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.579" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">interesting yeah it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.169" end="00:34:14.190" style="s2">that&#39;s very important now especially</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:17.099" style="s2">because we&#39;re in a very anti rational</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.190" end="00:34:22.200" style="s2">time or source like everything is about</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.099" end="00:34:24.089" style="s2">sensation and feeling and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.200" end="00:34:27.389" style="s2">to be you know say that feeling is bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.089" end="00:34:30.869" style="s2">but but everything is about everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.389" end="00:34:33.179" style="s2">is based on you know clicks and likes</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.869" end="00:34:36.149" style="s2">and it&#39;s experience and salience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.179" end="00:34:39.809" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah so that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.149" end="00:34:41.879" style="s2">very important too yeah okay that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.809" end="00:34:43.559" style="s2">know there&#39;s the ocean of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.879" end="00:34:45.450" style="s2">then there&#39;s also stepping out and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.559" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2">coming back in and going in and out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.450" end="00:34:49.589" style="s2">that mmm I think it&#39;s very needed and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:52.470" style="s2">would want I wouldn&#39;t want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.589" end="00:34:55.559" style="s2">let&#39;s use the Socratic model we just had</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.470" end="00:34:59.999" style="s2">and also some of the points we&#39;ve made I</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.559" end="00:35:02.369" style="s2">think our our time is irrational or</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.999" end="00:35:04.230" style="s2">lacking in rationality in two senses in</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.369" end="00:35:06.180" style="s2">one sense like a general the one general</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.230" end="00:35:07.559" style="s2">who just lets go with my intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.180" end="00:35:10.140" style="s2">my impulse and whatever just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.559" end="00:35:12.119" style="s2">comes to me and then we have no no let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.140" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">be rational let&#39;s be tell you exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.119" end="00:35:17.279" style="s2">what I was gonna say as well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s this this hyper rationality which</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.279" end="00:35:20.940" style="s2">is is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rationality at</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:22.230" style="s2">all what you would say is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.940" end="00:35:25.559" style="s2">rationality all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.230" end="00:35:27.989" style="s2">yeah I I&#39;m still have this deaf I still</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.559" end="00:35:29.640" style="s2">have the folk definition of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.989" end="00:35:31.250" style="s2">in my head so it&#39;s almost hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.640" end="00:35:37.010" style="s2">have the conversation until I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:39.650" style="s2">redefine the term rationality and like I</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.010" end="00:35:41.660" style="s2">said you&#39;re struggling against not only</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.650" end="00:35:43.790" style="s2">just sort of the familiarity of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.660" end="00:35:45.859" style="s2">folks psychological conception you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.790" end="00:35:47.750" style="s2">also struggling against the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.859" end="00:35:50.270" style="s2">have set up all these cultural patterns</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.750" end="00:35:52.369" style="s2">of identification and evaluation around</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.270" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">these terms right and we reward people</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.369" end="00:36:00.619" style="s2">and we claim this and we claim that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s also I think acting as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.619" end="00:36:05.540" style="s2">obstacle to trying to get back to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:08.150" style="s2">notion of rationality that actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:10.340" style="s2">starts to overlap with wisdom you see</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.150" end="00:36:12.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what they these two needs do this</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.340" end="00:36:14.530" style="s2">notion of rationality has just been sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.380" end="00:36:16.910" style="s2">of you know practical you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.530" end="00:36:18.710" style="s2">intelligence problem-solving or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.910" end="00:36:21.560" style="s2">notion of rationality is just being sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.710" end="00:36:23.510" style="s2">of good logic allottee it tells me</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.560" end="00:36:25.880" style="s2">nothing about wisdom basically it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.510" end="00:36:28.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really help me it doesn&#39;t help</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.099" end="00:36:31.910" style="s2">of cutting through yeah heading</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.200" end="00:36:35.570" style="s2">to what&#39;s relevant and then also</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.150" end="00:36:55.250" style="s2">so I I you know I&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:56.750" style="s2">because you know your story is almost</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.750" end="00:37:01.550" style="s2">saying the same thing you know he talks</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:03.410" style="s2">about it he talked about brain right</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.550" end="00:37:06.050" style="s2">brain you talk about opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.410" end="00:37:08.089" style="s2">very much working together those seem to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.050" end="00:37:09.650" style="s2">be kind of analogous whereas he says</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.650" end="00:37:15.020" style="s2">worlds up into bits and turning us into</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.480" end="00:37:19.869" style="s2">bureaucratic monsters and and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.020" end="00:37:24.020" style="s2">get more into the right brain world of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.869" end="00:37:27.260" style="s2">you know so a feeling and and and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.020" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">know or context and and the right of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.260" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">experience the embodied experience of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:35.089" style="s2">life you know and so how did you how did</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:37.369" style="s2">your conversation go how did you you</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.089" end="00:37:40.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk again it went so well</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.369" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">we really clicked really deeply so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.040" end="00:37:44.230" style="s2">know rebel wisdom they recorded it it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:47.310" style="s2">will be released at some point</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.230" end="00:37:49.030" style="s2">so a couple points on that first of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.310" end="00:37:52.089" style="s2">because this goes to what we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.030" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">talking about earlier perhaps a more</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.089" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">helpful way to think of right and left</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:58.270" style="s2">is to think and and I actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.800" style="s2">this up with the in in person and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.270" end="00:38:01.420" style="s2">said it was completely convergent with</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.800" end="00:38:03.849" style="s2">him so I have good reason to believe I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.420" end="00:38:06.910" style="s2">can speak sort of something that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.849" end="00:38:11.320" style="s2">agreeing on because I have in-person</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.910" end="00:38:13.480" style="s2">evidence right to say so you can because</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.320" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">I came at it I hadn&#39;t read Ian&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.480" end="00:38:18.490" style="s2">until about two weeks before I met was</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">gonna meet it okay as I came at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.490" end="00:38:21.900" style="s2">stuff and I came to similar conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:25.750" style="s2">from all the work I do on insight right</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.900" end="00:38:28.089" style="s2">inside problem-solving so a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.750" end="00:38:30.130" style="s2">think about the right hemisphere is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.089" end="00:38:33.400" style="s2">a way it works more in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.130" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">gestalt yes exactly yeah and so it likes</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.400" end="00:38:40.300" style="s2">wide open attention and it looks for for</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:43.480" style="s2">like for for it&#39;s sort of pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.300" end="00:38:47.380" style="s2">pattern completion right right whereas</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.480" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">the the left hemisphere is more feature</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.380" end="00:38:51.400" style="s2">lis oriented and it does things in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:52.900" style="s2">step-by-step matter it&#39;s doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.400" end="00:38:54.940" style="s2">doing something more like a pro running</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.900" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">a program than trying to complete a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.940" end="00:39:00.099" style="s2">pattern it&#39;s sort of building features</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:02.140" style="s2">up step by step by step right and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.099" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">think about the kind of attention it</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:07.150" style="s2">needs it needs very narrow focused it</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:10.390" style="s2">looks for a clarity or it doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.150" end="00:39:12.550" style="s2">ambiguity now here&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.390" end="00:39:15.339" style="s2">rationality when he live in the left</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.550" end="00:39:17.770" style="s2">brain but not that out in ax t and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.339" end="00:39:19.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s I think part of our Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.770" end="00:39:22.329" style="s2">heritage that&#39;s to identify rationality</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.960" end="00:39:24.220" style="s2">with analysis and Mary Cohen has brought</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.329" end="00:39:27.160" style="s2">this point up and I think to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.220" end="00:39:30.190" style="s2">identify rationality with analysis is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.160" end="00:39:31.510" style="s2">mistake I think it&#39;s it well for all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.190" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2">reasons I&#39;ve already articulated it</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.510" end="00:39:36.310" style="s2">truncates what rationality should mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:38.770" style="s2">especially because rationality is vote</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.310" end="00:39:40.869" style="s2">ratio finding the patterns rationing</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.770" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">right getting the getting the proper</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.869" end="00:39:45.130" style="s2">context it so it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:49.300" style="s2">logistical notion so why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.130" end="00:39:51.670" style="s2">these two well the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.300" end="00:39:53.829" style="s2">very good for well-defined problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.670" end="00:39:55.510" style="s2">problems in which you have a really good</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.829" end="00:39:57.730" style="s2">representation of your initial state</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.510" end="00:39:59.800" style="s2">your goals state what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.730" end="00:40:01.090" style="s2">actions and obviously I already know it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.800" end="00:40:01.840" style="s2">tells you and already know about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.090" end="00:40:03.850" style="s2">you already know</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.840" end="00:40:06.010" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s familiar to you in a deep way</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.850" end="00:40:08.859" style="s2">so a multiplication problem would for</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.010" end="00:40:11.350" style="s2">you for many people a very well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.859" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">familiar problem now compare that to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.350" end="00:40:15.880" style="s2">problem of avoiding predation yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:18.940" style="s2">does that look like well I&#39;m avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.880" end="00:40:19.330" style="s2">you know well you know what&#39;s my initial</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.940" end="00:40:22.390" style="s2">State</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.330" end="00:40:24.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure right right you know get a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.390" end="00:40:28.900" style="s2">notepad and start you know what the goal</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.820" end="00:40:30.609" style="s2">state looks like right very clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.900" end="00:40:32.500" style="s2">this is the thing and do most of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.609" end="00:40:34.630" style="s2">real-world problems this is why that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.500" end="00:40:37.810" style="s2">that notion of rationality of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.630" end="00:40:40.840" style="s2">are is so limiting most of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.810" end="00:40:43.150" style="s2">real-world problems are actually like</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.840" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">the problem of predation they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.150" end="00:40:46.690" style="s2">ill-defined problems you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:47.109" style="s2">trying to have a good conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.690" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.109" end="00:40:50.320" style="s2">mm-hm what&#39;s the initial condition well</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:52.180" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.320" end="00:40:54.190" style="s2">helpful what&#39;s the what&#39;s the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.180" end="00:40:55.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the goal state look like well I</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.190" end="00:40:58.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know the art does every good</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.960" end="00:41:00.910" style="s2">conversation look the same no they have</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.270" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">some feature what should I say what</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.910" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">should i do should I rave my hand shall</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:07.030" style="s2">raise my voice should I like watch it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:09.640" style="s2">like right you see what I mean or go on</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.030" end="00:41:12.130" style="s2">a successful first date or tell a joke</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.640" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t draw a picture to tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.130" end="00:41:15.460" style="s2">somebody this is how you go on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">successful first date give them you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.460" end="00:41:19.480" style="s2">can&#39;t offer you a to be yeah I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:20.980" style="s2">give a program help program yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.480" end="00:41:24.070" style="s2">but you can&#39;t that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.980" end="00:41:25.930" style="s2">useless there are way we get better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.070" end="00:41:28.180" style="s2">going on dates we get better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.930" end="00:41:29.320" style="s2">conversation and think about that think</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.180" end="00:41:31.570" style="s2">about that what I just said how that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.320" end="00:41:34.030" style="s2">goes back to what Socrates is doing in</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.570" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">the dialogues right you get better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.030" end="00:41:38.230" style="s2">becoming courageous right but that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:42.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I can give you a formula or</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.230" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">a program for orange yeah right now when</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.220" end="00:41:46.750" style="s2">I when I was trying to eat with like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">said we really so ian makes a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.750" end="00:41:50.260" style="s2">distinction it&#39;s kind of the reverse of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:52.750" style="s2">the distinction I make so it I think it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.260" end="00:41:53.560" style="s2">was it was largely semantic he actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.750" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">makes the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.560" end="00:41:58.359" style="s2">rationality and reason Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:00.430" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what I wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.359" end="00:42:02.619" style="s2">yeah and I picked up on reason is great</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.430" end="00:42:04.690" style="s2">because reason is holistic and again you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.619" end="00:42:06.550" style="s2">you put everything together and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.690" end="00:42:08.650" style="s2">should be reasonable but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.550" end="00:42:10.840" style="s2">but we&#39;re over emphasizing rationality</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.650" end="00:42:13.210" style="s2">and cutting that&#39;s you know here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.840" end="00:42:15.790" style="s2">I can say then very clearly I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.210" end="00:42:19.720" style="s2">rationality the way Ian uses reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.790" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">exactly using reason the way I use</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.720" end="00:42:27.370" style="s2">rationality right right so what he</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.870" end="00:42:29.950" style="s2">rejects is what I consider to be that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.370" end="00:42:31.750" style="s2">truncated folk psychological notion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.950" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">rationality that I think does not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.750" end="00:42:37.120" style="s2">represent anything that will help</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:41.050" style="s2">facilitate our aspiration towards wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.120" end="00:42:43.300" style="s2">hmm so although there is a problem maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.050" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">the problem I&#39;m seeing is that that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.300" end="00:42:49.870" style="s2">notion of rationality is so deep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:52.060" style="s2">like it&#39;s Cartesian it&#39;s woven it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.870" end="00:42:54.370" style="s2">woven into the scientific worldview it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.060" end="00:42:55.930" style="s2">woven into our epistemological models</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.370" end="00:42:57.610" style="s2">and those that worldview and those</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.930" end="00:42:59.380" style="s2">epistemological models get woven into</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.610" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">our psychological models they&#39;re woven</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.380" end="00:43:04.510" style="s2">into Freud they&#39;re woven into young</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">they&#39;re woven into many yeah that&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.510" end="00:43:09.190" style="s2">you that&#39;s why you that&#39;s why you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:10.930" style="s2">why guy is so attracted to Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.190" end="00:43:13.210" style="s2">because Heidegger is like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.930" end="00:43:16.030" style="s2">profoundly trying to break out of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.210" end="00:43:19.150" style="s2">whole Cartesian way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.030" end="00:43:22.840" style="s2">belief and truth and rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.150" end="00:43:25.270" style="s2">he&#39;s trying I think to get us back to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.840" end="00:43:28.320" style="s2">way of understanding rationality kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.270" end="00:43:31.060" style="s2">so maybe what he calls thinking is call</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.320" end="00:43:32.740" style="s2">rationality totally Tobin Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.060" end="00:43:35.350" style="s2">calls thinking and what he McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.740" end="00:43:37.630" style="s2">calls reason yes yes just sending</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.350" end="00:43:41.590" style="s2">different semantics areas here or yes I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.630" end="00:43:43.780" style="s2">agree agree so the the argument that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.590" end="00:43:47.020" style="s2">have sort of why I think rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.780" end="00:43:48.760" style="s2">actually an appropriate word is reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.020" end="00:43:50.500" style="s2">tends to be associated with reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.760" end="00:43:51.910" style="s2">but the throm with reason it&#39;s equivocal</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.500" end="00:43:53.740" style="s2">it can go to reasoning which means</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.910" end="00:43:55.540" style="s2">inference and argument we go to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.740" end="00:43:57.310" style="s2">reasonable which means this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.540" end="00:43:58.780" style="s2">thing we&#39;re talking about so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.310" end="00:44:01.660" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.780" end="00:44:03.820" style="s2">etymological origin of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.660" end="00:44:06.100" style="s2">Rati oh it&#39;s finding proportion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.820" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">it&#39;s putting things into proper relation</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.100" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2">it&#39;s getting the proper perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:13.600" style="s2">the relationship yeah exactly it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:15.850" style="s2">about pattern completion then commend</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.600" end="00:44:17.950" style="s2">running a program to completion those</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.850" end="00:44:20.030" style="s2">are two very very different things also</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.950" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.030" end="00:44:23.900" style="s2">at times what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:25.460" style="s2">because I well I</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.900" end="00:44:28.610" style="s2">we need them as you say break frame</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.460" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">right so for trying to be reasonable all</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.610" end="00:44:32.630" style="s2">the time if you know this is why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:36.320" style="s2">shaman is there you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.630" end="00:44:38.750" style="s2">shamans and you know - as you talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.320" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">about in your series yeah break out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.750" end="00:44:45.470" style="s2">the yeah nine dart problem or yep</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:48.500" style="s2">so but this brings me to this brings me</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.470" end="00:44:50.600" style="s2">to an important point I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.500" end="00:44:52.940" style="s2">say because I actually I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.600" end="00:44:54.710" style="s2">brought this argument up I presented at</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.940" end="00:44:58.100" style="s2">a conference at a couple conferences</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.710" end="00:45:00.380" style="s2">this idea that disruptive strategies are</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.100" end="00:45:03.320" style="s2">actually important for optimization</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.380" end="00:45:05.750" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s systematically and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.320" end="00:45:06.980" style="s2">reliably important for optimization so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.750" end="00:45:08.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re running a neural network for</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.980" end="00:45:11.180" style="s2">example you just let it just sort of run</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.720" end="00:45:13.790" style="s2">right it&#39;ll over fit to the data it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.180" end="00:45:15.740" style="s2">it&#39;ll find patterns in its sample and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.790" end="00:45:17.060" style="s2">really pick up on those patterns in its</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.740" end="00:45:19.220" style="s2">sample that don&#39;t actually general</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.060" end="00:45:21.740" style="s2">generalize to the population you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.220" end="00:45:23.360" style="s2">this is sampling bias right and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.740" end="00:45:25.460" style="s2">because the machines are so powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.360" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">your brain is way more powerful than any</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.460" end="00:45:30.230" style="s2">neural network so think about how you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:34.190" style="s2">can really zero in right and get bound</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.230" end="00:45:36.770" style="s2">to you can over fit to your particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.190" end="00:45:37.940" style="s2">sampling of data so what do you do in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.770" end="00:45:39.560" style="s2">the neural networks well you you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.940" end="00:45:42.230" style="s2">actually disrupt the network you shut</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.560" end="00:45:44.060" style="s2">off some you shut off half the nodes or</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.230" end="00:45:45.770" style="s2">you throw noise or static into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.060" end="00:45:48.280" style="s2">system and what that does is it makes</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.770" end="00:45:50.330" style="s2">the neural network we self organize</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.280" end="00:45:52.430" style="s2">right and that we&#39;ve stopped</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.330" end="00:45:54.080" style="s2">organization actually allows it to now</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.430" end="00:45:56.570" style="s2">generalize in ways it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.080" end="00:46:00.040" style="s2">generalize before yeah so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.570" end="00:46:03.560" style="s2">throw disruption in I recently did some</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.040" end="00:46:06.200" style="s2">graph breathing technique he&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.560" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">and I I don&#39;t do psychedelics but but</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:11.360" style="s2">but that kind of experience just it</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:13.610" style="s2">throws you into these wild sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.360" end="00:46:15.740" style="s2">spaces right right and it&#39;s wild and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.610" end="00:46:17.930" style="s2">that and then you come out the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.740" end="00:46:20.060" style="s2">side is if you&#39;ve gone into Alice in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:22.910" style="s2">Wonderland and you come out the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.060" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">side sort of like and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.910" end="00:46:28.490" style="s2">reassemble your ordinary existence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:29.640" style="s2">hopefully you&#39;ve got some insight after</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.490" end="00:46:32.869" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.640" end="00:46:35.460" style="s2">yeah and what what happens is your</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.869" end="00:46:39.180" style="s2">perspectival and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.460" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">have been shifted and so a new course of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.180" end="00:46:43.140" style="s2">development is actually available to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.140" end="00:46:47.579" style="s2">think about think about like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.720" end="00:46:49.410" style="s2">in that when you&#39;re in that space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.579" end="00:46:51.510" style="s2">like what happens in dreams a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.410" end="00:46:55.019" style="s2">variations are being thrown at like sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.510" end="00:46:57.299" style="s2">of generated options are being created</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.019" end="00:46:59.339" style="s2">that open up what&#39;s called the state</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.299" end="00:47:02.069" style="s2">space it opens up the possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.339" end="00:47:04.619" style="s2">that your brain can actually get itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.069" end="00:47:06.390" style="s2">into like my brain is a machine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.619" end="00:47:08.789" style="s2">constantly making itself into the kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.390" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">of machine and you want to periodically</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.789" end="00:47:13.650" style="s2">like with a neural network you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:15.569" style="s2">open up the options it can consider not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.650" end="00:47:17.789" style="s2">only the options in the world it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.569" end="00:47:19.980" style="s2">consider but the options for what kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.789" end="00:47:22.950" style="s2">of machine it can be it&#39;s those two</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.980" end="00:47:25.890" style="s2">together at the same time right and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.950" end="00:47:27.329" style="s2">if it and you can see this even an</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.890" end="00:47:29.190" style="s2">insight problem-solving if I give you an</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.329" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">insight negate and I moderately distract</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.190" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">you or even throw some static into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:35.250" style="s2">picture some noise that will actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:37.589" style="s2">help to trigger your insight of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.250" end="00:47:41.339" style="s2">yeah okay so get better at the game</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.589" end="00:47:44.609" style="s2">right if you&#39;re tripped up but yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.339" end="00:47:46.230" style="s2">do it the right way they 2000&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.609" end="00:47:47.240" style="s2">there&#39;s an X there&#39;s a kind of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.230" end="00:47:49.380" style="s2">or you have to do it in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.240" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">right there&#39;s no formula but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.380" end="00:47:52.200" style="s2">do in the right way but there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.319" style="s2">systemic and reliable ways of getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.200" end="00:47:57.509" style="s2">better at doing that disruption</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.319" end="00:48:00.660" style="s2">now here&#39;s my argument this disruption</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.509" end="00:48:03.150" style="s2">is really indispensable to optimization</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:04.609" style="s2">there are systemic and reliable ways of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.150" end="00:48:07.500" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.609" end="00:48:10.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that therefore be integral to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.500" end="00:48:12.990" style="s2">our account of wisdom that these</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.230" end="00:48:15.150" style="s2">disruptive processes and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.990" end="00:48:17.039" style="s2">although they&#39;re non inferential they</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.150" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">have actually no propositional content</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.039" end="00:48:20.250" style="s2">whatsoever because they&#39;re basically oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:23.460" style="s2">yeah zero propositional content right</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.250" end="00:48:27.059" style="s2">but nevertheless they move you towards a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.460" end="00:48:29.609" style="s2">more optimal that optimization of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.059" end="00:48:32.039" style="s2">know I have more options in what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.609" end="00:48:33.509" style="s2">cognitive being I can be yeah and where</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.039" end="00:48:35.490" style="s2">are more options about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.509" end="00:48:37.799" style="s2">world I can dwell within and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.490" end="00:48:40.380" style="s2">making you more rational yeah and well</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.799" end="00:48:42.990" style="s2">if ya again it&#39;s counter intuitive yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.380" end="00:48:43.350" style="s2">well I guess the rational world that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.990" end="00:48:45.420" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.350" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">often feels like a kind of prison right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.420" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">yes we&#39;re trapped in caught conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">models of things and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">reasons why you would you know you would</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:59.670" style="s2">you would want to break frame or you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:49:03.870" style="s2">fasting or you know or going into nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.670" end="00:49:07.290" style="s2">and you know have all kinds of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.870" end="00:49:09.210" style="s2">of those kind of experiences well this</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.290" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">brings me to another point and and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.210" end="00:49:13.770" style="s2">know I think Ian&#39;s bang on about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:16.260" style="s2">left and right stuff but there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.770" end="00:49:17.190" style="s2">there&#39;s another opponent process that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.260" end="00:49:19.830" style="s2">you need to bring into the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.190" end="00:49:21.210" style="s2">here which is the relationship like</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.830" end="00:49:23.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re constantly toggling</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.210" end="00:49:28.260" style="s2">between being tasks centered and mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.880" end="00:49:29.880" style="s2">wandering right um and the and the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.260" end="00:49:32.280" style="s2">of mind wandering I would argue at least</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.880" end="00:49:34.410" style="s2">one of it&#39;s funny wondering is to break</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.280" end="00:49:36.330" style="s2">frame it&#39;s - its - its to bring in some</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.410" end="00:49:39.120" style="s2">mild distraction take you into a weird</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.330" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s key again our guy sorry I keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.120" end="00:49:44.010" style="s2">saying I because I&#39;m in France but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:46.770" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s what guy does well</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.010" end="00:49:49.470" style="s2">see Heidegger was about wandering so</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:51.120" style="s2">what he&#39;s planning to do is I think what</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.470" end="00:49:52.920" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s doing is you know you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.120" end="00:49:55.080" style="s2">stay on the path that&#39;s like the machine</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.920" end="00:49:56.550" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna over fit right and what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.080" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">need to do is you need to wander a bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.550" end="00:50:01.350" style="s2">right you need to go off almost like in</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:03.300" style="s2">mind-wandering and what that does is</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.350" end="00:50:04.860" style="s2">allow you to you know introduce the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.300" end="00:50:07.050" style="s2">noise introduce some variation break</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.860" end="00:50:09.390" style="s2">some frame so that so but you keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.050" end="00:50:11.580" style="s2">moving forward but you&#39;re now actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.390" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">improving your connectedness to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.580" end="00:50:17.700" style="s2">world rather than just getting to your</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.710" end="00:50:19.620" style="s2">destination on your path yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.700" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">also speaks to the pathology of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.620" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">montmartre modernity right is that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:27.330" style="s2">don&#39;t maybe we don&#39;t wander enough we</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:29.220" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t want it enough han says</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.330" end="00:50:33.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t we fill up the space too much</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.220" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">with with with you know information yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.600" end="00:50:42.309" style="s2">and salience and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.140" end="00:50:43.900" style="s2">we like that&#39;s why also pointed out Hans</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.309" end="00:50:51.160" style="s2">notion of lingering it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.900" end="00:50:52.869" style="s2">we fill up this space we right we will</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.160" end="00:50:54.789" style="s2">take Heidegger being a time that your</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.869" end="00:50:56.829" style="s2">being is at hint inherently temporal</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.789" end="00:50:58.809" style="s2">right and so you are wait you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.829" end="00:51:01.539" style="s2">respectable and participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.809" end="00:51:03.819" style="s2">time because you don&#39;t know time in any</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.539" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">other way right the Augustine famously</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.819" end="00:51:06.759" style="s2">said this I know what time is until</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:09.309" style="s2">somebody asks me what it is because</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.759" end="00:51:11.710" style="s2">right you only know time by being in</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.309" end="00:51:13.960" style="s2">time right by being a temporal thing but</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.710" end="00:51:16.359" style="s2">so your existential mode with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.960" end="00:51:17.739" style="s2">time how you&#39;re experiencing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.359" end="00:51:19.509" style="s2">wrong word that&#39;s the only word I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.739" end="00:51:20.710" style="s2">how you&#39;re participating maybe let me</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.509" end="00:51:23.470" style="s2">let me use that word how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.710" end="00:51:27.190" style="s2">participating in time existentially has</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.470" end="00:51:29.859" style="s2">a huge impact on the kind of being you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.190" end="00:51:32.140" style="s2">can be and so hans point is we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.859" end="00:51:35.230" style="s2">moving into a culture in which we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">leader we can&#39;t we can&#39;t we can&#39;t flow</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.230" end="00:51:39.609" style="s2">with things wait everything is atomized</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:40.829" style="s2">we&#39;re going down like minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.609" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.829" end="00:51:48.940" style="s2">is his cut up that&#39;s exactly the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:51.640" style="s2">how - yeah mm-hmm and so you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.940" end="00:51:54.759" style="s2">any flow you get you get the you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.640" end="00:51:59.230" style="s2">sort of the salient second right you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.759" end="00:52:01.269" style="s2">know um so a lot of people have met talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.230" end="00:52:03.369" style="s2">to me about this and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.269" end="00:52:05.289" style="s2">seeing we&#39;re seeing this consistent</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.369" end="00:52:08.109" style="s2">trend towards the death of melody in</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.289" end="00:52:10.690" style="s2">popular music that we&#39;re losing melodic</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.109" end="00:52:13.390" style="s2">complexity and there&#39;s this compressed</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.690" end="00:52:15.460" style="s2">sound all the time with mp3 it&#39;s extreme</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.390" end="00:52:17.819" style="s2">compression of sound and screams</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.460" end="00:52:22.569" style="s2">compression of sound and salience in</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.819" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">salience and intensity are taking up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.569" end="00:52:26.170" style="s2">place of right complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.509" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.170" end="00:52:29.859" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to follow a long piece of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.509" end="00:52:31.839" style="s2">music and go through all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.859" end="00:52:34.210" style="s2">transformation you can instantly without</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.839" end="00:52:36.609" style="s2">effort get sort of hit by the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.210" end="00:52:39.609" style="s2">product right yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.609" end="00:52:43.299" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s and so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.609" end="00:52:46.539" style="s2">for us is that like I said it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.299" end="00:52:49.829" style="s2">that we can&#39;t linger we can&#39;t stay with</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.539" end="00:52:52.349" style="s2">things in a way that affords us</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.829" end="00:52:53.910" style="s2">during the projects of aspiration yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.349" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">think I&#39;ve liked going to the galleries</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.910" end="00:52:59.729" style="s2">like I live near in Paris and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">all these galleries and how many people</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.729" end="00:53:04.349" style="s2">look at a painting you know yes how many</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:05.489" style="s2">people go into and actually just stay</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.349" end="00:53:07.079" style="s2">with the painting and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.489" end="00:53:09.390" style="s2">painting and and find out a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.079" end="00:53:11.219" style="s2">experience right yes most people would</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.390" end="00:53:13.670" style="s2">would would what sort of you know look</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.219" end="00:53:15.779" style="s2">at the painting and like take a picture</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.670" end="00:53:16.950" style="s2">snapshot of it with their iPhone and say</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.779" end="00:53:20.759" style="s2">I&#39;d been there and I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.950" end="00:53:22.229" style="s2">painting what but but that that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.759" end="00:53:24.749" style="s2">just what I said the point is to collect</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.229" end="00:53:27.269" style="s2">atoms to collect moments that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.749" end="00:53:29.190" style="s2">atomized and are removed from a flow of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.269" end="00:53:32.069" style="s2">development they&#39;re just snapshots yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.190" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">I think I think their remedy to that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.069" end="00:53:36.809" style="s2">of the remedies I&#39;ve seen is probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.930" end="00:53:39.690" style="s2">meditation in some sense because yep for</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.809" end="00:53:41.729" style="s2">for our modern times you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.690" end="00:53:43.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s how else can you how else</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.729" end="00:53:44.819" style="s2">can you because there&#39;s so much stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.559" end="00:53:48.479" style="s2">all the time how else can you take a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.819" end="00:53:50.249" style="s2">break from that and I think I think I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.479" end="00:53:53.190" style="s2">think I think both meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.249" end="00:53:56.069" style="s2">contemplation are needed sure you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.190" end="00:53:59.759" style="s2">to break frame and make frame I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.069" end="00:54:02.609" style="s2">being able to enter into the Ilocos to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.759" end="00:54:04.289" style="s2">enter into a conversation oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.609" end="00:54:06.900" style="s2">another thing for me like that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.289" end="00:54:09.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve been meditating for years but but</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.900" end="00:54:11.579" style="s2">you and guyun that&#39;s a that&#39;s a new kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.479" end="00:54:15.449" style="s2">of possibility for me I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.579" end="00:54:17.039" style="s2">thought of that so much well I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.449" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">is the this is part of the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.039" end="00:54:22.890" style="s2">notion that training your rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.359" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">the sense I&#39;ve been arguing for and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.890" end="00:54:27.690" style="s2">training your sociality are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:30.479" style="s2">interpenetrating things that&#39;s why he</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.690" end="00:54:32.999" style="s2">presents his philosophy in a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.479" end="00:54:35.849" style="s2">because you&#39;re not you&#39;re those two</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.999" end="00:54:38.759" style="s2">those two things our ability to connect</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.849" end="00:54:40.170" style="s2">to distributed cognition and participate</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.759" end="00:54:42.059" style="s2">in collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.170" end="00:54:45.180" style="s2">collective rationality or dare I say</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.059" end="00:54:47.789" style="s2">collective wisdom in its it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.180" end="00:54:49.650" style="s2">resonance with our individual project of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.789" end="00:54:52.109" style="s2">aspiring to rationality and wisdom these</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.650" end="00:54:55.170" style="s2">two things mutually afford and depend on</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.109" end="00:55:04.080" style="s2">each other hmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.170" end="00:55:07.560" style="s2">yeah yeah and also I was just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.080" end="00:55:10.860" style="s2">thinking about how how why this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.560" end="00:55:12.900" style="s2">conversation is compelling to people and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.860" end="00:55:15.300" style="s2">stuff which it&#39;s kind of a weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.900" end="00:55:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like a homeless or like homeless</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.300" end="00:55:21.120" style="s2">here or something saying that to the guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.750" end="00:55:23.640" style="s2">last night it&#39;s like we&#39;re putting in</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.120" end="00:55:26.430" style="s2">these videos on YouTube it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.640" end="00:55:28.320" style="s2">the mainstream culture but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.430" end="00:55:31.170" style="s2">be there seems to be a need for it for</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.320" end="00:55:35.700" style="s2">that kind of kind of totally I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.170" end="00:55:37.400" style="s2">the online world I mean it has it has</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.700" end="00:55:40.260" style="s2">sort of it has some of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.400" end="00:55:42.840" style="s2">magnifiers of the things that exhauster</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.260" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">bade the meeting crisis you know but you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.840" end="00:55:46.200" style="s2">know you Heidegger talks about where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.540" style="s2">know what I think he&#39;s holder lining</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.200" end="00:55:51.420" style="s2">quotes where the danger is there there</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.540" end="00:55:52.290" style="s2">also right the future grows I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.420" end="00:55:54.270" style="s2">a translation I might have missed</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.290" end="00:55:56.750" style="s2">translate it but the basic idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.270" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">know because it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.750" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">destabilizing the system it&#39;s also but</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:04.470" style="s2">also it could be an affordance of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:06.750" style="s2">system going through self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.470" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">rather than disintegration you can even</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.750" end="00:56:11.790" style="s2">say a death and rebirth of some yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:16.170" style="s2">kind of thing a shamanic kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.790" end="00:56:17.880" style="s2">and so what what I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.170" end="00:56:19.830" style="s2">happening with the Chris and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.880" end="00:56:21.270" style="s2">about the meta conversation you have all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.830" end="00:56:22.710" style="s2">these conversations and then what</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.270" end="00:56:24.330" style="s2">YouTube is doing is setting up this</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.710" end="00:56:26.010" style="s2">thing where people are having</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.330" end="00:56:28.500" style="s2">conversations but they&#39;re doing them</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.010" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">with the awareness right and their</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.500" end="00:56:32.250" style="s2">connectivity to other conversations so</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:33.870" style="s2">there&#39;s not only idea logos within a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.250" end="00:56:36.690" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s this Neil logos</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.870" end="00:56:38.220" style="s2">that stay in place between all of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.690" end="00:56:40.650" style="s2">conversations and the way they constrain</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.220" end="00:56:43.830" style="s2">and impregnate and engender each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.650" end="00:56:46.110" style="s2">in this kind of complex self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.830" end="00:56:47.910" style="s2">dynamic which is really really important</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.110" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">because you see the same thing again at</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.910" end="00:56:51.420" style="s2">least analogous and the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:53.100" style="s2">dialogues you shouldn&#39;t just ever read</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.420" end="00:56:55.350" style="s2">one platonic dialogue that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.100" end="00:56:58.320" style="s2">you should be because you should read</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.350" end="00:57:00.420" style="s2">all of the ecosystem again of yes all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.320" end="00:57:02.520" style="s2">yes exactly all of the dialogues are</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.420" end="00:57:04.650" style="s2">speaking to and influencing and changing</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.520" end="00:57:06.570" style="s2">and affecting each other in powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.650" end="00:57:09.000" style="s2">ways and we&#39;re doing something and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.570" end="00:57:11.700" style="s2">it gets to that here&#39;s a dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.000" end="00:57:13.500" style="s2">one with guy and then there talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.700" end="00:57:15.810" style="s2">other and speak to each other yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.500" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">that will inform me to speak to you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.810" end="00:57:19.710" style="s2">then somebody else might get a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:24.089" style="s2">something out of this and bring it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.710" end="00:57:25.980" style="s2">yeah yeah again to bring a Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.089" end="00:57:28.020" style="s2">platonic thing and there&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.980" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">for Aragog eh that&#39;s that reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.020" end="00:57:33.450" style="s2">opening that you and I have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">before so the conversation when it when</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.450" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">it moves into dialogo so you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">reciprocal opening that&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:40.710" style="s2">that of course is again a kind of love</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">right because when people get into</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.710" end="00:57:44.569" style="s2">difficult opening they at the experience</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.859" style="s2">they have the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.569" end="00:57:48.660" style="s2">affective state love isn&#39;t an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.859" end="00:57:50.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a higher-order affective state but</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.660" end="00:57:53.339" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an effective state right up</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.940" end="00:57:55.829" style="s2">love enough to get how the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.339" end="00:57:58.470" style="s2">and the sociality and the love are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.829" end="00:58:00.839" style="s2">bound together how should I put them all</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.470" end="00:58:02.369" style="s2">back together uh-huh got you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.839" end="00:58:04.349" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re all sort of in little</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.369" end="00:58:08.819" style="s2">islands over here and they need to come</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.349" end="00:58:10.589" style="s2">again one place exactly that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.819" end="00:58:12.690" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m as critical of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.589" end="00:58:15.150" style="s2">Romanticism as I am of empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.690" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">because both of them keep although those</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.150" end="00:58:19.829" style="s2">things apart but for different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:21.510" style="s2">for different positions that they hold</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.829" end="00:58:23.730" style="s2">and different epistemologies and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.510" end="00:58:26.490" style="s2">metaphysics and I think all of them are</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.730" end="00:58:30.030" style="s2">therefore equally at fault for keeping</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.490" end="00:58:32.460" style="s2">those things apart no I mean I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.030" end="00:58:34.260" style="s2">bit of a you know a gloss my other</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.460" end="00:58:36.390" style="s2">question actually I wrote that down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.260" end="00:58:38.730" style="s2">like what can we what can we take from</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.390" end="00:58:41.940" style="s2">Romanticism because romanticism is so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.730" end="00:58:42.420" style="s2">powerful it&#39;s so you know so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.940" end="00:58:45.900" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.420" end="00:58:49.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s so you know we need that and on</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.900" end="00:58:52.470" style="s2">some level especially in our you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.800" end="00:58:55.020" style="s2">online world people are so blase and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.470" end="00:59:00.359" style="s2">stuff we we need to we don&#39;t know I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.020" end="00:59:01.300" style="s2">a feeling that that we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.359" end="00:59:03.310" style="s2">grandeur</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.300" end="00:59:06.580" style="s2">sort of experiences and emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.310" end="00:59:08.440" style="s2">that that were being too polite and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.580" end="00:59:10.390" style="s2">timid and it&#39;s it&#39;s like being in a cage</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.440" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">of some kind of Romanticism is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.390" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">trying to break that cage a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:17.530" style="s2">it is I mean so again I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:20.020" style="s2">engage in some self-criticism and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.530" end="00:59:24.310" style="s2">actually allowed me to do so so thank</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.020" end="00:59:26.140" style="s2">you for that I mean I I try to make a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.310" end="00:59:27.700" style="s2">distinction between what I call decadent</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.140" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">romanticism which is sort of a folk</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.700" end="00:59:32.560" style="s2">psychological version of romanticize</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:34.840" style="s2">Cheryl right and sometimes I have not</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.560" end="00:59:37.630" style="s2">been careful enough about that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.840" end="00:59:39.220" style="s2">do apologize to people because you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.630" end="00:59:40.420" style="s2">to take a look at like just like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.220" end="00:59:43.000" style="s2">think you should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.420" end="00:59:44.500" style="s2">post-modernism it&#39;s like I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.000" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">should zero in on particular thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.500" end="00:59:50.170" style="s2">particular arguments because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:52.780" style="s2">variation and so here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.170" end="00:59:54.280" style="s2">say and especially the I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.780" end="00:59:56.410" style="s2">I want to call them romantics that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.280" end="00:59:57.940" style="s2">early the you know the early post</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.410" end="01:00:01.060" style="s2">contents like Schlegel and people like</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.940" end="01:00:03.490" style="s2">that I I think they&#39;re actually saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.060" end="01:00:07.570" style="s2">things remarkably similar to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:10.540" style="s2">trying to argue for and but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.570" end="01:00:12.820" style="s2">romanticism that you get especially</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.540" end="01:00:17.020" style="s2">Rousseau&#39;s version of Romanticism yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.820" end="01:00:19.180" style="s2">which is a prototypical version of it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.020" end="01:00:20.770" style="s2">it singable romanticism and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.180" end="01:00:21.640" style="s2">say this I want to try and convey</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.770" end="01:00:23.860" style="s2">something and I&#39;m going to say it</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.640" end="01:00:26.440" style="s2">carefully and hopefully provocatively</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.860" end="01:00:27.790" style="s2">it&#39;s closer to the truth than the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.440" end="01:00:29.020" style="s2">impaired and that empiricism and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.790" end="01:00:32.740" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.020" end="01:00:37.780" style="s2">dangerous it&#39;s more dangerous because</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.740" end="01:00:39.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not contained and in that it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.780" end="01:00:44.670" style="s2">collective experience it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.970" end="01:00:44.670" style="s2">okay there&#39;s that so you&#39;ve got Russo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.420" end="01:00:50.770" style="s2">glorification of individual subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.970" end="01:00:54.790" style="s2">okay you know that&#39;s clearly a true self</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.770" end="01:00:56.140" style="s2">right I mean he does have stuff about</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.790" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">the general will but when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.140" end="01:01:01.330" style="s2">about how he&#39;s the father of Romanticism</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:04.030" style="s2">this the the glorification of individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.330" end="01:01:06.100" style="s2">subjectivity is there the idea that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.030" end="01:01:08.890" style="s2">come with a true self that you must be</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.100" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">true to which is antithetical to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.890" end="01:01:12.430" style="s2">idea of aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:16.979" style="s2">so it&#39;s antithetical to the ceramic</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.430" end="01:01:23.859" style="s2">ideal of aspiration the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.979" end="01:01:24.930" style="s2">this subjectivity should be thought of</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.859" end="01:01:28.809" style="s2">like so</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.930" end="01:01:30.700" style="s2">what was so stalking about it he he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.809" end="01:01:32.190" style="s2">does not express enough worry about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.700" end="01:01:35.099" style="s2">problem the problem of self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.190" end="01:01:37.479" style="s2">sort of separating all of this from</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.099" end="01:01:39.729" style="s2">rationality as I&#39;ve tried to describe to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.479" end="01:01:41.380" style="s2">describe it right to put the Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.729" end="01:01:42.910" style="s2">notion of overcoming the ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.380" end="01:01:46.420" style="s2">we deceive ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.910" end="01:01:48.910" style="s2">ourself this exploration and expression</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.420" end="01:01:51.579" style="s2">of your individual subjectivity in your</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.910" end="01:01:54.670" style="s2">capacity to imagination of will for</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.579" end="01:01:56.140" style="s2">imposing an order on the world well</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.670" end="01:01:59.079" style="s2">think about how that could just be</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.140" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">filled with self-deception honey you</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.079" end="01:02:06.069" style="s2">know you&#39;re like projection and bias and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:10.299" style="s2">Prejudice like all of those things right</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.069" end="01:02:14.200" style="s2">and so romanticism doesn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.299" end="01:02:18.999" style="s2">separated itself off from deep concerns</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.200" end="01:02:20.829" style="s2">about human the human proclivity for</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.999" end="01:02:23.650" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.829" end="01:02:28.029" style="s2">which is why we we get the almost the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.650" end="01:02:30.670" style="s2">romantic trope of you know how living</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.029" end="01:02:33.099" style="s2">romantically ultimately is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.670" end="01:02:35.079" style="s2">self-destructive of the people who try</p>

<p begin="01:02:35.079" end="01:02:41.799" style="s2">that in you know sort of weathering</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.609" end="01:02:43.499" style="s2">Heights kind of stuff right oh yeah my</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.799" end="01:02:45.729" style="s2">mother read that book like 20 times</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.499" end="01:02:47.979" style="s2">let&#39;s say so there&#39;s that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.729" end="01:02:52.119" style="s2">appealing to people yeah I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.979" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">a self-destructive element in that or</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.119" end="01:02:57.640" style="s2">well they also a hatred of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:03:03.009" style="s2">or a hatred of your efforts to to you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.640" end="01:03:08.920" style="s2">know you know build things and yep yep</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.009" end="01:03:11.829" style="s2">so there there is a lot of so it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.920" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">terrific and I want even catch both</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.829" end="01:03:17.079" style="s2">senses of that word it was a terrific</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:19.479" style="s2">terrific strategy for breaking the frame</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.079" end="01:03:21.400" style="s2">of empiricist enlightenment for breaking</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.479" end="01:03:24.219" style="s2">the frame that John Locke gave us of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.400" end="01:03:25.869" style="s2">tabula rasa mind and the world imposes</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.219" end="01:03:28.380" style="s2">itself in the finger of the world right</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.869" end="01:03:30.750" style="s2">so my mind it was a great counteracted</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.380" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">that yeah but I think it generates its</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.750" end="01:03:35.910" style="s2">own frame that needs to be broken and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:36.509" style="s2">broken Bo that&#39;s well said you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.910" end="01:03:40.380" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.509" end="01:03:44.609" style="s2">hmm hmm that&#39;s why Heidegger is so</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.380" end="01:03:46.500" style="s2">interested in being because right annan</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.609" end="01:03:49.799" style="s2">challenging the idea that we should</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.500" end="01:03:51.180" style="s2">impose our will on the world right that</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.799" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">the world is just a standing reserve</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.180" end="01:03:56.730" style="s2">because the part of what heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:59.099" style="s2">trying to get us to remember is you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.730" end="01:04:01.099" style="s2">Locke has the mind as a blank slate but</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.099" end="01:04:05.029" style="s2">Rousseau has the world as a blank canvas</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.099" end="01:04:06.990" style="s2">upon which we paint our subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.029" end="01:04:09.509" style="s2">Heidegger is trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.990" end="01:04:14.009" style="s2">remember no no it&#39;s not a blank canvas</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.509" end="01:04:19.109" style="s2">it&#39;s a world it is deep and profound and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.009" end="01:04:24.539" style="s2">beyond us yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.109" end="01:04:27.329" style="s2">hmm and it discloses itself you know as</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.539" end="01:04:28.440" style="s2">it will who&#39;s feyza huh I&#39;ve heard two</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.329" end="01:04:30.089" style="s2">pronunciations and I keep getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.440" end="01:04:32.849" style="s2">corrected by both camps on how I should</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.089" end="01:04:34.710" style="s2">pronounce the Greek term I I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.849" end="01:04:36.539" style="s2">brought in my intellect in my undergrad</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.710" end="01:04:37.799" style="s2">everybody pronounced it as fuzes but</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.539" end="01:04:40.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve been told no it&#39;s not more like</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.799" end="01:04:42.869" style="s2">Jesus or Isis or something or physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.890" end="01:04:45.059" style="s2">right that&#39;s the word disclosure and in</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.869" end="01:04:46.890" style="s2">hiding where did we get physics from but</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.059" end="01:04:50.579" style="s2">it means it means the way in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.890" end="01:04:52.319" style="s2">nature blossoms from itself blooms from</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.579" end="01:04:54.900" style="s2">itself but also the way in which nature</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.319" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">loves to hide itself oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.900" end="01:05:02.099" style="s2">right right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:04.710" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah Heidegger is another</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.099" end="01:05:07.559" style="s2">subject yeah that&#39;s yeah and I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.710" end="01:05:09.990" style="s2">having excellent conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.559" end="01:05:11.940" style="s2">Johannes about this and I think it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.990" end="01:05:13.890" style="s2">on his channel I&#39;m gonna put up the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.940" end="01:05:15.420" style="s2">dialogue that I had with you excellent</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.890" end="01:05:17.519" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have it up and he and I and</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.420" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">I are gonna talk shortly about sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.519" end="01:05:21.839" style="s2">Heidegger but I&#39;m gonna put up the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:24.089" style="s2">dialogue I had with Johannes I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.839" end="01:05:26.130" style="s2">it I&#39;m doing a couple new series right</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.089" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the minding media series but</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.130" end="01:05:29.460" style="s2">I&#39;m also doing this series I&#39;m entitled</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:32.609" style="s2">it yet but what I&#39;m having just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.460" end="01:05:34.170" style="s2">trying to exemplify dialectic which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.609" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">the psycho technology of engendering</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.170" end="01:05:39.450" style="s2">deal logos I&#39;m trying to exemplify that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:41.710" style="s2">and get into these like these</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.450" end="01:05:44.200" style="s2">discussions where we&#39;re exemplified</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.710" end="01:05:46.630" style="s2">and explicate a what did what does</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.200" end="01:05:48.070" style="s2">spirituality mean within the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.630" end="01:05:49.180" style="s2">worldview and the meeting crisis what</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.070" end="01:05:52.180" style="s2">does that mean for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.180" end="01:05:54.910" style="s2">uh-huh right we had an accent</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.180" end="01:05:57.040" style="s2">conversation on Heidegger and science</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.910" end="01:06:01.660" style="s2">and technology yeah I loved it I saw</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.040" end="01:06:04.599" style="s2">someone half of it and I was released</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.660" end="01:06:06.700" style="s2">later the other do you think you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.599" end="01:06:09.970" style="s2">what you wanted to say about about about</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.700" end="01:06:12.490" style="s2">wisdom and and and rationality and what</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.970" end="01:06:14.020" style="s2">is there any is really loose ends here</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.490" end="01:06:16.270" style="s2">yeah I want to say one more thing about</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.020" end="01:06:17.650" style="s2">sort of clarifying a bit the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.270" end="01:06:21.790" style="s2">relationship between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.650" end="01:06:24.760" style="s2">rationality I think that we should think</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.790" end="01:06:27.160" style="s2">of ecologies of practices for each one</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.760" end="01:06:30.609" style="s2">of the kinds of knowing that make us</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.160" end="01:06:33.310" style="s2">more rational so you know ecologies of</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.609" end="01:06:35.320" style="s2">practices for propositional knowing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.310" end="01:06:37.480" style="s2">cognitive practices for procedural</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.320" end="01:06:39.400" style="s2">knowing ecologies of practices for</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.480" end="01:06:43.030" style="s2">prospective and participatory so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.400" end="01:06:44.859" style="s2">have some examples well I think the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.030" end="01:06:47.080" style="s2">ecology of practice for propositional</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.859" end="01:06:48.820" style="s2">knowing we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.080" end="01:06:50.320" style="s2">what we and we think we know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.820" end="01:06:52.540" style="s2">talking about when we use this term I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.320" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">going to use but if you do any</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.540" end="01:06:55.810" style="s2">philosophy around this we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:59.470" style="s2">know what we need and this is the term</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.810" end="01:07:01.540" style="s2">science science is about whole ecology</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.470" end="01:07:04.150" style="s2">of practices and it&#39;s bound up with</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.540" end="01:07:08.680" style="s2">history right I mean yeah and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.150" end="01:07:11.470" style="s2">way of trying to get to be as rational</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.680" end="01:07:13.240" style="s2">as we can because I the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.470" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">method it&#39;s actually a family of methods</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.240" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">is not about coming to certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:20.140" style="s2">conclusions it&#39;s about really trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:22.839" style="s2">reduce the influence of self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.140" end="01:07:24.070" style="s2">on our inferential processes and our</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.839" end="01:07:27.190" style="s2">propositional knowing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.070" end="01:07:29.800" style="s2">actually is going on the site science is</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.190" end="01:07:31.390" style="s2">largely about trying to set things up so</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.800" end="01:07:34.210" style="s2">that we can break through our patterns</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.390" end="01:07:37.330" style="s2">of self-deception right now you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.210" end="01:07:39.880" style="s2">similar things right in your procedural</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.330" end="01:07:41.589" style="s2">knowing and this is where you know I</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.880" end="01:07:45.400" style="s2">think the martial art traditions give us</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.589" end="01:07:47.530" style="s2">fantastic example well how to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.400" end="01:07:49.570" style="s2">ecologies and practices and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.530" end="01:07:54.250" style="s2">Rafe Kelley is just doing some amazing</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.570" end="01:07:55.190" style="s2">and important work right on this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.250" end="01:07:58.790" style="s2">thing nah</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.190" end="01:08:00.619" style="s2">right the way he&#39;s using parkour and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.790" end="01:08:02.720" style="s2">integrating it with martial art practice</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.619" end="01:08:04.579" style="s2">and mindfulness but go and see some of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.720" end="01:08:06.920" style="s2">the his videos see some of the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.579" end="01:08:09.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with him mm-hm the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.920" end="01:08:11.150" style="s2">of knowing well that of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.410" end="01:08:13.310" style="s2">where all the stuff on attention and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.150" end="01:08:15.079" style="s2">awareness the mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.310" end="01:08:18.440" style="s2">right the flow induction practices are</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.079" end="01:08:21.620" style="s2">really important knowing that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.440" end="01:08:24.230" style="s2">the deal logos that&#39;s what this is yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.620" end="01:08:26.150" style="s2">okay yeah participatory knowing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.230" end="01:08:30.170" style="s2">trying to we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.150" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">to alter our not just our thoughts but</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.170" end="01:08:34.790" style="s2">our identities the way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:37.430" style="s2">mutually shaping each other the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.790" end="01:08:39.890" style="s2">we&#39;re being the way us and the world are</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.430" end="01:08:41.719" style="s2">engaging so I will I&#39;m entering into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.890" end="01:08:43.219" style="s2">reciprocal opening with you but together</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.719" end="01:08:45.529" style="s2">we&#39;re also trying to enter into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.219" end="01:08:49.699" style="s2">reciprocal opening with the world right</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.529" end="01:08:51.920" style="s2">and so yeah mm-hmm great great so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.699" end="01:08:54.799" style="s2">my point there let&#39;s say there are</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.920" end="01:08:56.359" style="s2">reliable systematic and reliable kinds</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.799" end="01:08:58.040" style="s2">of rationality for each of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.359" end="01:08:59.690" style="s2">knowing there&#39;s propositional</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.040" end="01:09:02.469" style="s2">rationality procedural rationality</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.690" end="01:09:04.759" style="s2">perspective of rationality and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.469" end="01:09:06.650" style="s2">participatory then you need something</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.759" end="01:09:09.350" style="s2">that optimizes the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.650" end="01:09:10.180" style="s2">all of those rationalities hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.350" end="01:09:17.359" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.180" end="01:09:20.180" style="s2">hmm so wisdom is about the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:23.739" style="s2">it&#39;s about all between between all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.180" end="01:09:27.949" style="s2">about it&#39;s kind of the the whole yep</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.739" end="01:09:30.040" style="s2">okay okay I see it&#39;s kind of its wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.949" end="01:09:36.210" style="s2">is very much a kind of meta rationality</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.040" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">right yeah least that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.210" end="01:09:40.590" style="s2">I think that I think that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:42.270" style="s2">identical to what that like gnosis that</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.590" end="01:09:46.910" style="s2">the world gnosis came to me to me is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.270" end="01:09:50.160" style="s2">that each one of them I tend to think of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.910" end="01:09:52.770" style="s2">APIs to me for a propositional tech made</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.160" end="01:09:53.460" style="s2">from for procedural noesis for</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.770" end="01:09:56.370" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.460" end="01:09:59.430" style="s2">and gnosis for participatory and then I</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.370" end="01:10:01.260" style="s2">think Sophia and phronesis describe the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.430" end="01:10:03.390" style="s2">two aspects of wisdom the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.260" end="01:10:05.460" style="s2">aspect that&#39;s from Mises and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.390" end="01:10:07.830" style="s2">top-down house so when I when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.460" end="01:10:09.900" style="s2">coordinating those four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.830" end="01:10:12.330" style="s2">I need a powerful I need a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.900" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">bottom-up and I need a lot of top-down</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.330" end="01:10:17.370" style="s2">I need phronesis and I need Sofia uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.370" end="01:10:22.980" style="s2">wow that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole structure you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:25.200" style="s2">well you know it goes towards the work</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.980" end="01:10:28.230" style="s2">I&#39;m doing with Daniel Craig on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.200" end="01:10:29.550" style="s2">cognitive continuum by the way I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.230" end="01:10:33.540" style="s2">want to mention I have an IndieGoGo</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.550" end="01:10:35.940" style="s2">campaign for and I&#39;m not getting any</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.540" end="01:10:38.850" style="s2">money from that campaign or from the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.940" end="01:10:40.650" style="s2">book the money is I&#39;m a university</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.850" end="01:10:42.990" style="s2">professor I get a salary I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.650" end="01:10:44.670" style="s2">Daniel the student and he&#39;s committing</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.990" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">to working on this book with me and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.670" end="01:10:48.180" style="s2">not even on writing he&#39;s generating art</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:49.680" style="s2">he&#39;s putting - he&#39;s basically key like</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.180" end="01:10:51.870" style="s2">the movie producer as well as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.680" end="01:10:53.640" style="s2">co-author and so this money is to help</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.870" end="01:10:55.950" style="s2">to support him as he&#39;s doing all of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.640" end="01:10:58.050" style="s2">work but that what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.950" end="01:11:00.660" style="s2">in the cognitive continuum is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.050" end="01:11:02.700" style="s2">this because I think and I try to argue</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.660" end="01:11:06.300" style="s2">that in the series I think we can get</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.700" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">also instead of like instead of building</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.300" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">a mystique around these terms and this</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:13.200" style="s2">is where like Evan Thompson&#39;s work I</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:15.030" style="s2">think is really important also Steven</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.200" end="01:11:18.960" style="s2">Bachelor both of them are now post</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.030" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">Buddhists because they object to</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.960" end="01:11:23.700" style="s2">Buddhist Buddhist exceptionalism the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:26.130" style="s2">idea that Buddhism is somehow a special</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.700" end="01:11:28.020" style="s2">or privileged religion compared to all</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.130" end="01:11:32.190" style="s2">the rest because it&#39;s somehow was</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.020" end="01:11:35.580" style="s2">scientific and I object to that as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.190" end="01:11:37.560" style="s2">I I knew would and he would and you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.580" end="01:11:39.570" style="s2">to remember that both Steven and I know</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.560" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve met Steven had dinner with him and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.570" end="01:11:43.680" style="s2">Evan is a colleague and friend of mine</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:45.510" style="s2">they&#39;re both deep your deep friends of</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.680" end="01:11:48.970" style="s2">Buddhism these are not hostile yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.510" end="01:11:51.880" style="s2">go outside right and so right they</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.970" end="01:11:53.200" style="s2">to the fact that the what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.880" end="01:11:55.480" style="s2">this let&#39;s take a term like</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.200" end="01:11:58.720" style="s2">enlightenment it&#39;s bound up with entire</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.480" end="01:12:00.790" style="s2">cultural projects and worldviews and it</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.720" end="01:12:02.890" style="s2">often has this mystique around it</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.790" end="01:12:04.150" style="s2">remember let me tell you how this</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.890" end="01:12:06.250" style="s2">frustrates me you know I&#39;ve asked</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.150" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">Buddhist you know how many people in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.250" end="01:12:09.250" style="s2">world do you think are enlightened right</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.020" style="s2">now and they&#39;ll say well probably no one</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.250" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">and then it&#39;s sort of my mom minded go</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.020" end="01:12:15.820" style="s2">but what the heck is it for that right I</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:19.770" style="s2">mean the term is meaningless right and</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.820" end="01:12:21.610" style="s2">so so I think instead just like I try to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.770" end="01:12:24.190" style="s2">give you&#39;ll allow me I tried to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.610" end="01:12:26.710" style="s2">reverse-engineer wisdom I tried to build</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.190" end="01:12:29.770" style="s2">it up out of fear right and and in terms</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.710" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">of what we wanted to do and Howard well</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.770" end="01:12:31.750" style="s2">I think we should do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.690" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.750" end="01:12:37.120" style="s2">I think enlightenment is we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.690" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">reverse engineer it oh it&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:41.380" style="s2">word isn&#39;t it it&#39;s just it&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:44.440" style="s2">word and what I think we should do is</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.380" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">right this is how I want to use the word</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.440" end="01:12:47.470" style="s2">and maybe we should use a different word</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:49.660" style="s2">because because of the critiques that</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.470" end="01:12:53.980" style="s2">Stephen and especially Evan are making</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.660" end="01:12:55.300" style="s2">but I want Amy so once I have wisdom the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.980" end="01:12:59.200" style="s2">two are gonna be bound together</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.300" end="01:13:02.220" style="s2">I want a wise ecology of practices that</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.200" end="01:13:05.680" style="s2">it helps me transform cognition</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.220" end="01:13:07.810" style="s2">consciousness character and communitas</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.680" end="01:13:10.750" style="s2">so that I can systematically and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.810" end="01:13:13.870" style="s2">reliably overcome the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.750" end="01:13:16.750" style="s2">of self-deception and self-destruction</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.870" end="01:13:19.060" style="s2">and afford enhancing all of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.750" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">connections what I call religio that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.060" end="01:13:25.750" style="s2">so constitutive of meaning in life for</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:28.030" style="s2">me that&#39;s enlightenment because it has</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.750" end="01:13:31.300" style="s2">to be some other deep metaphysical thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.030" end="01:13:34.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t care because I want to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.300" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">to help people alleviate you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.720" end="01:13:38.620" style="s2">suffering of the perennial problems and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:40.630" style="s2">afford the flourishing of enhanced</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.620" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">connectivity to themselves to each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.630" end="01:13:44.650" style="s2">in the world hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:46.600" style="s2">yeah so you want to stay within in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.650" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">real I guess I want it and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.600" end="01:13:50.710" style="s2">stipulate how I&#39;m gonna use the term and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:52.630" style="s2">I&#39;m trying and so there I&#39;m saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.710" end="01:13:55.450" style="s2">not using it ambiguously I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.630" end="01:13:58.630" style="s2">not use it in a way that is loaded into</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.450" end="01:13:59.980" style="s2">a particular I mean I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.630" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">completely free of a cultural worldview</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.980" end="01:14:02.390" style="s2">but I&#39;m not trying to bind it to a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:04.580" style="s2">particular culture</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.390" end="01:14:06.830" style="s2">tradition instead I&#39;m trying to pick up</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.580" end="01:14:09.350" style="s2">on what science gives us access to is</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.830" end="01:14:11.510" style="s2">universal features and principles of our</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.350" end="01:14:15.470" style="s2">cognition and then you know the notion</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.510" end="01:14:19.220" style="s2">that is pragmatically engineered for a</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.470" end="01:14:24.530" style="s2">specific set of what badly and widely</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.220" end="01:14:26.870" style="s2">needed goals hmm you know so I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.530" end="01:14:28.790" style="s2">reason this this term is so offensive is</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.870" end="01:14:32.720" style="s2">that it kind of I was just thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.790" end="01:14:36.020" style="s2">it kind of it implies a an end product</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.720" end="01:14:37.820" style="s2">or something it&#39;s so a deeply critical</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.020" end="01:14:40.550" style="s2">of that a deeply critical of sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.820" end="01:14:42.110" style="s2">perfection completion aspects of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.550" end="01:14:46.280" style="s2">term enlightenment are deeply critical</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.110" end="01:14:48.440" style="s2">of the people refused to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.280" end="01:14:50.090" style="s2">that they&#39;re sliding between something</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.440" end="01:14:52.010" style="s2">that&#39;s explaining the world and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.090" end="01:14:54.170" style="s2">something that&#39;s evaluating the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.010" end="01:14:56.060" style="s2">right it&#39;s to use sort of technical</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.170" end="01:14:58.280" style="s2">language and this is one of evans</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.060" end="01:15:00.140" style="s2">criticisms like you don&#39;t want to you</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.280" end="01:15:02.690" style="s2">don&#39;t want to confuse your best</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.140" end="01:15:04.880" style="s2">description of how reality is with your</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.690" end="01:15:05.930" style="s2">your best sort of normative claims about</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.880" end="01:15:08.470" style="s2">how things should be</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.930" end="01:15:11.330" style="s2">those aren&#39;t those aren&#39;t the same and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.470" end="01:15:13.190" style="s2">so for example why does that matter well</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.330" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">science isn&#39;t doing that second thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.190" end="01:15:17.930" style="s2">science is not in the project uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:19.730" style="s2">the way things should be this is you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.930" end="01:15:21.590" style="s2">know this is moral this is moral</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.730" end="01:15:23.480" style="s2">excellence this is a static excellent</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.590" end="01:15:25.550" style="s2">science isn&#39;t it it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.480" end="01:15:26.710" style="s2">machinery for doing that science is</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.550" end="01:15:27.890" style="s2">about trying to give the best</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.710" end="01:15:30.110" style="s2">explanations</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.890" end="01:15:32.540" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really afford us you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.110" end="01:15:34.730" style="s2">aspirational projects and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.540" end="01:15:36.530" style="s2">Buddhism is an aspirational project and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.730" end="01:15:38.960" style="s2">therefore to pretend that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.530" end="01:15:41.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.960" end="01:15:43.310" style="s2">scientific ah that&#39;s a category mistake</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.240" end="01:15:45.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a category mistake for sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.310" end="01:15:47.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not yeah so it&#39;s just one way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.920" end="01:15:51.920" style="s2">knowing right and then Buddhism might be</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.660" end="01:15:53.540" style="s2">another way well and I think addresses</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.920" end="01:15:56.350" style="s2">something that science doesn&#39;t address</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.540" end="01:15:58.310" style="s2">which is aspirational project of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.350" end="01:16:00.770" style="s2">transformation and self transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.310" end="01:16:03.380" style="s2">and right and that it&#39;s gonna have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.770" end="01:16:06.680" style="s2">historical cultural aspect to it right</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.380" end="01:16:08.060" style="s2">yeah so I think what we should do with</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.680" end="01:16:09.560" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do what Daniel are</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.060" end="01:16:11.240" style="s2">trying to do is well let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.560" end="01:16:13.520" style="s2">different cultural models and then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.240" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">look at that this engineering this</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.520" end="01:16:16.989" style="s2">pragmatically engineering sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:18.429" style="s2">enlightenment that I&#39;ve just given you</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.989" end="01:16:20.469" style="s2">and let&#39;s put them into dialogue and try</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.429" end="01:16:23.519" style="s2">and get some convergent thing that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.469" end="01:16:26.860" style="s2">has less of the off-putting mystique of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.519" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">a lot of because you know when you when</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.860" end="01:16:30.760" style="s2">you talk to people about enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:33.099" style="s2">it&#39;s it verges on the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.760" end="01:16:36.010" style="s2">supernatural and the person is becoming</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.099" end="01:16:36.820" style="s2">godlike and it&#39;s like well if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.010" end="01:16:38.110" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.820" end="01:16:40.090" style="s2">then and I don&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.110" end="01:16:42.130" style="s2">disrespectfully to Buddhist but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.090" end="01:16:45.150" style="s2">interested in that I&#39;m really not</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.130" end="01:16:50.340" style="s2">interested in in and godlike people or</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.150" end="01:16:50.340" style="s2">yeah I mean I&#39;m interested I you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.059" end="01:16:58.360" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.849" end="01:17:00.099" style="s2">becoming more and more at one with sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.360" end="01:17:02.500" style="s2">of the sacred depths of reality but</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.099" end="01:17:04.510" style="s2">that&#39;s very different from it&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.500" end="01:17:06.880" style="s2">a question of growth not a question of</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.510" end="01:17:08.679" style="s2">some ultimate state or yes some ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.880" end="01:17:12.550" style="s2">state and some and some ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.679" end="01:17:14.349" style="s2">transhuman State mm-hmm so there&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.550" end="01:17:16.869" style="s2">of a Nietzsche and critiquing in my head</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.349" end="01:17:18.460" style="s2">here about stop a young you should be</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.869" end="01:17:20.889" style="s2">overcoming yourself but you should never</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.460" end="01:17:30.219" style="s2">be abandoning your humanity in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.889" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">project so VC he I guess I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.219" end="01:17:36.400" style="s2">gonna say something a little provocative</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:38.289" style="s2">here I I find humanity ultimately good</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.400" end="01:17:40.989" style="s2">enough this is why I love Conrad so much</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.289" end="01:17:44.110" style="s2">the heart of darkness you compare Marlow</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.989" end="01:17:46.840" style="s2">and Kurds Kurds takes on the hubristic</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.110" end="01:17:48.369" style="s2">past of becoming a god right and then he</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.840" end="01:17:51.880" style="s2">suffers the horror of the horror of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.369" end="01:17:55.690" style="s2">world Marlow makes conscious decision to</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.880" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">act to exercise restraint and stay with</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.690" end="01:17:59.889" style="s2">his humanity right that he will not even</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:01.750" style="s2">though they&#39;ll follow the journey he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.889" end="01:18:03.579" style="s2">go all the way to seeing hurts he will</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.750" end="01:18:05.019" style="s2">never abandon his humanity that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.579" end="01:18:07.690" style="s2">the heart of darkness I think it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.019" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">a powerful be important well that seems</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.690" end="01:18:11.500" style="s2">to be the Bodhisattva vow if if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:11.889" style="s2">defending Buddhism a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.500" end="01:18:14.710" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.889" end="01:18:17.380" style="s2">uh-huh is is is is to do just that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.710" end="01:18:20.019" style="s2">it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not to sate yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.380" end="01:18:21.880" style="s2">think the Bodhisattva it might have been</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.019" end="01:18:24.940" style="s2">a bit of a corrective than in Mahayana</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.880" end="01:18:27.039" style="s2">for Tara Baden the because the body rots</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.940" end="01:18:28.329" style="s2">over is therefore right much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.039" end="01:18:29.409" style="s2">different than the are heart in some</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.329" end="01:18:30.849" style="s2">ways yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.409" end="01:18:33.459" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thought I hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.849" end="01:18:35.709" style="s2">about that but yeah that because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.459" end="01:18:40.419" style="s2">a there&#39;s a commitment to you staying</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.709" end="01:18:42.459" style="s2">with humanity yeah you know and and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.419" end="01:18:44.469" style="s2">every being is your they call it mother</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.459" end="01:18:46.479" style="s2">being it&#39;s like every being as your</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.469" end="01:18:48.969" style="s2">mother and and you you have to liberate</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.479" end="01:18:51.939" style="s2">every being it&#39;s a wild sort of idea but</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.969" end="01:18:55.510" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a sort of wild heroic idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.939" end="01:18:57.579" style="s2">that&#39;s but it but it&#39;s not very rational</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.510" end="01:18:59.139" style="s2">certainly not I think it&#39;s rational in</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.579" end="01:18:59.409" style="s2">the way always is Russia here we go</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.139" end="01:19:01.389" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.409" end="01:19:05.139" style="s2">it&#39;s just I can&#39;t get the folk</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.389" end="01:19:05.860" style="s2">rationally ID out of my head but I like</p>
