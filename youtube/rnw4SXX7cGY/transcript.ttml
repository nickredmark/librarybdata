<p begin="00:00:00.979" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">what it takes so long to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:15.509" style="s2">dragon thing man took me a huge it took</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:17.130" style="s2">me a long long time to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.509" end="00:00:21.800" style="s2">separate that out from the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:21.800" style="s2">archetypes you know it was alright</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.230" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">alright so I&#39;m going to bang through a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">bunch of images here and so that&#39;s an L</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">chemical illustration it&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">this thing it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">so you can see the okay so you can think</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">about this as a map of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">development or you can think about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">as a representation of how potential</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">reveals itself in actuality and it sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">of works from the bottom up so the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">thing you see there is that container</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:10.280" style="s2">and if you notice the dragon is emitting</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">sperm into this thing that&#39;s like an egg</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.280" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">so and then this egg thing has wings and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the round chaos I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">about before it&#39;s the container of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.570" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">you can think about it you can think</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">about it as the container of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">matters and one of the ways of really</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">thinking about of organizing your</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">framework so that these this way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">understanding can work for you is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:41.189" style="s2">start thinking about the world as being</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">made out of what matters and then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.189" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">come into contact that now and then when</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">you come into contact with something</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">that matters now Heidegger had an idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">like this by the way Heidegger was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">interested in he thought Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">philosophy had gone off its tracks in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">some sense with with Socrates which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">think is unfair I think what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">that Western philosophy developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">immensely in one direction and left some</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">other directions not very developed so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">Socrates like derailed us but he helped</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.210" style="s2">us blow up and really a lot in wonder</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:18.610" style="s2">but Heidegger said look knots about for</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.210" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">a while it&#39;s too rational it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.610" end="00:02:23.830" style="s2">limited and it it it misses the central</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">issue for Heidegger the central issue is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.830" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">what is being now you might have heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">about David Chalmers you anybody ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2">heard of David Chalmers ok so David</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">Chalmers got famous because he made this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.060" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">question about consciousness he said</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:42.730" style="s2">there&#39;s the hard problem and the easy</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.920" style="s2">problem of consciousness the hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.730" end="00:02:47.860" style="s2">problem is is why we are conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.920" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">because his notion which I think is I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.860" end="00:02:51.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to make of it really</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been that fond of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.400" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">we could just as easily be totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:03:00.100" style="s2">deterministic zombies machines with no</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:01.930" style="s2">consciousness whatsoever it&#39;s like or we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:04.210" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out why we couldn&#39;t be like</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.930" end="00:03:06.040" style="s2">that you know we could build a robot</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.210" end="00:03:08.440" style="s2">hypothetically that did everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.040" end="00:03:11.050" style="s2">we did that wasn&#39;t conscious now maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.440" end="00:03:13.720" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t but maybe we could so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.050" end="00:03:16.330" style="s2">what is consciousness and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">I think that&#39;s formulated that question</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.330" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">is formulated improperly because I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">the hard question is way harder than</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2">Chalmers hard question because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:27.580" style="s2">question of being is a harder question</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:30.310" style="s2">and the question of being is why is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.580" end="00:03:32.709" style="s2">there anything at all and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.310" end="00:03:34.510" style="s2">that is and and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.709" end="00:03:38.020" style="s2">distinguishable from the from the hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.510" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">question because in some sense there</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.020" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything without consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:46.750" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of looking at things now</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:49.750" style="s2">so that&#39;s the container of what matters</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:54.459" style="s2">and then out of that that&#39;s very that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.750" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">as generalized in abstract as you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.459" end="00:04:01.390" style="s2">possibly get it&#39;s it&#39;s what&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:02.890" style="s2">across every instance of what matters</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.390" end="00:04:04.750" style="s2">now Heidegger also thought that our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.890" end="00:04:06.880" style="s2">basic orientation to the world was one</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.750" end="00:04:09.340" style="s2">of care because he was trying to qualify</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">our experience what is our experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.340" end="00:04:14.709" style="s2">like or he would say what is human being</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.220" end="00:04:16.480" style="s2">like and one of the things he said is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.709" end="00:04:18.370" style="s2">well it seems to involve care we care</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.480" end="00:04:21.010" style="s2">about things or we don&#39;t care about them</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.370" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">but but care is central to what it means</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:27.130" style="s2">to be human and so that the contact</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">between those</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.130" end="00:04:34.780" style="s2">that set of ideas and this is that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">of the aspects of being is that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.780" end="00:04:38.890" style="s2">matters now sometimes it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:41.020" style="s2">at all that&#39;s what it appears to be but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.890" end="00:04:44.110" style="s2">it looks like we&#39;re still concerned</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.020" end="00:04:46.780" style="s2">about what matters we&#39;re very hurt when</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.110" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">nothing matters anymore right and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.780" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">would say part of what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">nothing matters anymore is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:56.980" style="s2">completely blinded by our map the map is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.100" end="00:05:00.820" style="s2">blinding us completely to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.980" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">possibilities of being we spiral</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.820" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">downward as a consequence of that so</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:07.270" style="s2">what&#39;s happening here is that what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">matters itself first manifests itself in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">this horrific dragon-like form because</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:17.650" style="s2">it&#39;s so because what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.820" end="00:05:21.010" style="s2">understand and what&#39;s anomalous to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.650" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">is it&#39;s certainly capable of devouring</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.010" end="00:05:27.310" style="s2">you but it&#39;s paradoxical and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">these archetypes are also so complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.310" end="00:05:33.760" style="s2">because logical people always say</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:36.850" style="s2">everything is either one thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">itself and the opposite of itself at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.850" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">same time but and that&#39;s a like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">prerequisite for for the world that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.870" style="s2">can apprehend logically but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:48.430" style="s2">with that is is it&#39;s wrong lots of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.870" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">things are what they are and what and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.430" end="00:05:52.030" style="s2">the opposite of what they are at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2">same time human beings are like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.030" end="00:05:55.930" style="s2">like you can hate someone and love them</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.920" end="00:05:58.090" style="s2">at the same time no problem and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.930" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">could be a hateable and a lovable object</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.090" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">at exactly the same time and life can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">wonderful and tragic and cruel at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:09.820" style="s2">same time it&#39;s like so the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:13.000" style="s2">are actually partly there so to help us</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.820" end="00:06:15.070" style="s2">represent entities or experiences or</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.000" end="00:06:17.530" style="s2">classes of experience that don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.070" end="00:06:19.630" style="s2">logical framework we can&#39;t separate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.530" end="00:06:21.940" style="s2">bloody things out they always confront</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.630" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">us as a as a unity and so the dragon&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.940" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">figure the predatory reptile is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:29.200" style="s2">that because you might say without the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:31.780" style="s2">predatory reptile there&#39;s no gold and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.200" end="00:06:35.140" style="s2">then you might ask well is the reptile</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.780" end="00:06:37.000" style="s2">worth the gold it&#39;s like well maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.140" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">gold is worth more than the reptile I</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">mean that&#39;s basically what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">are betting on you know we&#39;re betting</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:44.740" style="s2">that if we confront the unknown and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:47.319" style="s2">gather the treasure for gathered the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.740" end="00:06:49.419" style="s2">information as a consequence that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.319" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">help us beat the dragon there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.419" end="00:06:54.310" style="s2">the the gold is bet is more than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:56.380" style="s2">dragon better be you know but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.310" end="00:06:58.060" style="s2">betting on that and that is not terror</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.060" end="00:07:03.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole different idea it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.000" end="00:07:08.440" style="s2">part of the bad is this is a Kierkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.410" end="00:07:10.750" style="s2">Ian&#39;s idea you don&#39;t know that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.440" end="00:07:14.289" style="s2">but you could live as if it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:17.110" style="s2">Kierkegaard would say if you live as if</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.289" end="00:07:18.610" style="s2">it&#39;s true then it might become true but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.110" end="00:07:20.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll never know unless you try to live</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.610" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">as if it&#39;s true and that&#39;s the act of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.680" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">faith from a character Guardian</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:28.389" style="s2">perspective you have to aid priority</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:30.759" style="s2">decide that that will work and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.389" end="00:07:32.530" style="s2">have to follow it and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.759" end="00:07:34.090" style="s2">willing to see where it leads now I</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.530" end="00:07:35.590" style="s2">talked about this in one of my other</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.090" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">classes I think I finally got it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.590" end="00:07:40.659" style="s2">in some ways this is something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:42.340" style="s2">thinking about because I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.659" end="00:07:44.710" style="s2">this is a critical choice that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.340" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">make so here&#39;s two ways to use language</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.710" end="00:07:50.919" style="s2">like let&#39;s say I&#39;m going to pick up a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:53.889" style="s2">girl in a bar all right so I have a goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.919" end="00:07:56.050" style="s2">in mind and the goal is sort of the girl</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.889" end="00:07:58.509" style="s2">is irrelevant to the goal insofar as she</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.050" end="00:08:00.690" style="s2">could be another girl so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.509" end="00:08:03.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a psychopathic goal in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.690" end="00:08:05.650" style="s2">because really really because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.310" end="00:08:07.030" style="s2">individual doesn&#39;t matter it is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.650" end="00:08:09.340" style="s2">serious about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.030" end="00:08:11.050" style="s2">it&#39;s an so what I&#39;m gonna do say if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.340" end="00:08:13.030" style="s2">a pickup artist I follow these pickup</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.050" end="00:08:15.159" style="s2">artists on line a because I&#39;m so curious</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.030" end="00:08:17.020" style="s2">about their use of psychology and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.159" end="00:08:19.780" style="s2">they ever do is come up with it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.020" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">whole horde of men talking about how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.780" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">deceive and manipulate women it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:28.930" style="s2">extremely psychopathic and and also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:31.449" style="s2">very very very very very unsophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.930" end="00:08:32.740" style="s2">and unskilled because what the guys are</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.449" end="00:08:34.539" style="s2">they&#39;re lumps</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.740" end="00:08:36.579" style="s2">basically and what they&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.539" end="00:08:39.159" style="s2">is to acquire the veneer of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.579" end="00:08:42.039" style="s2">sophistication and that&#39;s psychopathic</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.159" end="00:08:43.810" style="s2">so anyways that&#39;s my my little spiel on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.039" end="00:08:45.850" style="s2">pickup artists but they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.810" end="00:08:47.740" style="s2">interesting so what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.850" end="00:08:49.150" style="s2">teaching their followers instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.740" end="00:08:51.520" style="s2">language and so if you want to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.150" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">with a girl here&#39;s how to do it here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.520" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">how to manipulate her you don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">have a bunch of tricks like where</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:59.980" style="s2">expensive watch and dress up and also</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:01.959" style="s2">don&#39;t just dress up so dress up rich</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:04.149" style="s2">roughly speaking but also add something</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.959" end="00:09:06.670" style="s2">peculiar to your wardrobe like something</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.149" end="00:09:08.949" style="s2">that really stands out as somewhat odd</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.670" end="00:09:10.779" style="s2">they call that peacocking so that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.949" end="00:09:12.759" style="s2">girl can see that not only are you rich</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.779" end="00:09:14.769" style="s2">and successful but you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.759" end="00:09:16.449" style="s2">little bit of individuality that sets</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.769" end="00:09:18.339" style="s2">you apart from all the other rich and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.449" end="00:09:20.319" style="s2">successful guys you know and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.339" end="00:09:22.089" style="s2">like a no Cyrus Horace combination</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.319" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">basically but it&#39;s all because</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.089" end="00:09:25.750" style="s2">the guys aren&#39;t like that so it&#39;s so-so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">and then they have all these little</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.750" end="00:09:28.899" style="s2">routines they use that are verbal</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:30.430" style="s2">routines and they have these guys they</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.899" end="00:09:32.410" style="s2">go to the bar with to help them with</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.430" end="00:09:34.329" style="s2">their little routines and it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.410" end="00:09:36.730" style="s2">completely what are they doing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.329" end="00:09:38.949" style="s2">using language instrumentally they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:40.630" style="s2">a goal in mind which is their goal and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.949" end="00:09:42.610" style="s2">they know that what the goal is and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.630" end="00:09:44.139" style="s2">know that the goal is right insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.610" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">they&#39;re pursuing the goal and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.139" end="00:09:50.829" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to say anything to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.380" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">obtain that goal now you think well I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.829" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">think that&#39;s the instrumental use of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:10:00.250" style="s2">language what do you do if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:02.670" style="s2">using instrumental language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.250" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">interesting what you do is you try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.670" end="00:10:08.019" style="s2">communicate about the situation and your</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:10.509" style="s2">response to the situation whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.019" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">as clearly and accurately and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.509" end="00:10:17.949" style="s2">articulately as you possibly can all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:21.220" style="s2">time and see what happens that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.949" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">different thing because the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">there is to the degree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:33.310" style="s2">transforming your experience into</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.339" end="00:10:35.589" style="s2">reality into articulated reality the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.310" end="00:10:37.769" style="s2">things that will follow from that will</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.589" end="00:10:40.810" style="s2">be the best things that can possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.769" end="00:10:42.370" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t know what they are so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.810" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">there&#39;s an openness and in that approach</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.370" end="00:10:47.259" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m gonna conduct my</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">relationship with person X in the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.259" end="00:10:51.759" style="s2">truthful possible manner and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">see what happens and then I&#39;m also going</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.759" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">to assume that whatever happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:10:56.290" style="s2">best thing that could have happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">because like how the hell do you know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.290" end="00:10:59.259" style="s2">it&#39;s the best thing that could have</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:00.730" style="s2">happened maybe the person&#39;s all offended</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.259" end="00:11:03.010" style="s2">and irritated I&#39;ve seen this with my</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.730" end="00:11:04.329" style="s2">clients a lot so especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.010" end="00:11:05.769" style="s2">agreeable ones say because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.329" end="00:11:07.720" style="s2">bent out of shape with resentment</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.769" end="00:11:08.710" style="s2">because they&#39;re not saying something you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.720" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">know and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.710" end="00:11:10.990" style="s2">and you know and because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">saying something they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.990" end="00:11:14.230" style="s2">shepherded into some situation they</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be in like maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.230" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">they have to go live with someone they</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">don&#39;t want to live with and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.900" end="00:11:20.340" style="s2">want to you know express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">because that&#39;ll hurt someone&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.340" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like so we talk about that in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:27.460" style="s2">bunch and we figure out how you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:29.350" style="s2">say what you actually think and usually</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.460" end="00:11:32.290" style="s2">what happens is they say it they get in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.350" end="00:11:36.450" style="s2">a whole bunch of trouble and then two</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.290" end="00:11:40.150" style="s2">days later the problem goes away so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.450" end="00:11:42.370" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid to say what they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.150" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">actually using silence instrumentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.370" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">basically because their idea is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:49.300" style="s2">want to fight with you well so how do I</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:52.180" style="s2">not fight with you I don&#39;t say anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.300" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">that will upset you it&#39;s like well upset</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:57.430" style="s2">you win exactly you know like if you if</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.780" style="s2">you&#39;re an intimate partner with someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.430" end="00:12:01.030" style="s2">and you see them doing something stupid</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.780" end="00:12:03.280" style="s2">repeatedly that is going to lead them</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.030" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">into a pit in like a month or two months</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.280" end="00:12:07.720" style="s2">or a year or five years you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:09.400" style="s2">say well I&#39;m not gonna fight with you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.720" end="00:12:10.690" style="s2">just because that&#39;ll be trouble because</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.400" end="00:12:12.700" style="s2">sooner or later they&#39;re gonna fall in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.690" end="00:12:13.960" style="s2">pit and that&#39;s gonna be trouble too so</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.700" end="00:12:16.780" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing them any damn favors</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.960" end="00:12:19.300" style="s2">you&#39;re just for stalling the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.780" end="00:12:21.220" style="s2">into the future it&#39;s not helpful where</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.300" end="00:12:22.960" style="s2">instead you could say well here&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.220" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">looks to me and this is you know how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.960" end="00:12:27.010" style="s2">looks it looks to me like this is where</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:28.750" style="s2">this is going and you probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.010" end="00:12:30.730" style="s2">want to go there and even if you do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.750" end="00:12:31.840" style="s2">not going to aid and abet it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.730" end="00:12:33.130" style="s2">they&#39;re going to get all upset and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.840" end="00:12:34.450" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna tell you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.130" end="00:12:35.710" style="s2">interfering and that you&#39;re mean and</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.710" end="00:12:39.100" style="s2">see the bad and things and if you wished</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:40.990" style="s2">and all that and they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.100" end="00:12:42.190" style="s2">really angry and stomp out and if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.990" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">can withstand that then they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.190" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">cry and tell you you&#39;re you know a son</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.520" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2">they&#39;ll go home and think about it and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:53.290" style="s2">week later they&#39;ll come back and say I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:55.420" style="s2">never want to see you again probably not</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.290" end="00:12:57.670" style="s2">or they&#39;ll say geez you know I thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.420" end="00:12:59.260" style="s2">about that and what you said made sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.670" end="00:13:04.810" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna do I&#39;m gonna try to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.260" end="00:13:06.490" style="s2">something about it so but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.810" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">decide to begin with whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.490" end="00:13:12.130" style="s2">whether or not you&#39;re willing to risk</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:13.390" style="s2">the consequences of the truth and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:15.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you get to use the truth as</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.390" end="00:13:17.950" style="s2">a weapon I mean that&#39;s not truthful you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.850" end="00:13:21.190" style="s2">can use the truth as a weapon you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.950" end="00:13:22.259" style="s2">if you see someone who&#39;s perhaps not as</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.190" end="00:13:25.799" style="s2">attractive as</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.259" end="00:13:28.109" style="s2">could be you could say your your rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.799" end="00:13:29.879" style="s2">ugly you know which in some senses of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.109" end="00:13:32.129" style="s2">the truth it&#39;s a it&#39;s a statement about</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.879" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the truth at all because</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.129" end="00:13:36.059" style="s2">for it to be the truth it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:39.479" style="s2">embedded what it really has to be is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.059" end="00:13:41.879" style="s2">embedded in the Osiris Horus pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.479" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">you know what the utterance has to serve</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.879" end="00:13:47.970" style="s2">the entire function of that integrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.649" style="s2">unit it has to serve tradition it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.970" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">serve enlightenment it has to serve</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.649" end="00:13:54.089" style="s2">vision and if it isn&#39;t doing any of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:56.609" style="s2">those things it&#39;s not the truth even if</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.089" end="00:13:58.709" style="s2">it&#39;s the truth in this local tiny slice</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.609" end="00:14:01.109" style="s2">you know I I just told you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.709" end="00:14:02.759" style="s2">it&#39;s like no you didn&#39;t you took a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.109" end="00:14:04.199" style="s2">little fragment of what could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.759" end="00:14:06.479" style="s2">interpreted to be the truth and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.199" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">turned it into a bat and then you hit me</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.479" end="00:14:10.019" style="s2">with the bat and then you defended</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.609" style="s2">yourself by a false argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.019" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">claiming that when you use the truth in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.609" end="00:14:16.889" style="s2">a local manner like that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:19.649" style="s2">moral that&#39;s right that&#39;s not true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.889" end="00:14:21.179" style="s2">incredibly deceptive because you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.649" end="00:14:23.549" style="s2">the best way to deceive someone is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.179" end="00:14:25.679" style="s2">sort of tell them the truth and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.549" end="00:14:30.389" style="s2">not only you can really get the person</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.679" end="00:14:31.649" style="s2">their name because not only are you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.389" end="00:14:33.689" style="s2">innocent because you&#39;ve told the truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.649" end="00:14:35.429" style="s2">they&#39;re even more guilty because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.689" end="00:14:37.439" style="s2">too weak to handle the truth so man you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.429" end="00:14:42.989" style="s2">can really wall up someone with that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.439" end="00:14:45.359" style="s2">anyways that&#39;s the container of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.989" end="00:14:48.089" style="s2">matters and it first manifests itself in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.359" end="00:14:49.319" style="s2">this potentially horrific form and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.089" end="00:14:51.389" style="s2">then the question is well are you</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.319" end="00:14:53.879" style="s2">willing to confront that and in what way</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.389" end="00:14:58.139" style="s2">are you willing to confront it and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.879" end="00:15:00.539" style="s2">out of that arises at the very top</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.139" end="00:15:02.519" style="s2">that&#39;s illumination you know it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.539" end="00:15:03.899" style="s2">the night first I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.519" end="00:15:06.589" style="s2">crescent moon although I might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.899" end="00:15:09.269" style="s2">about that I think it&#39;s a crescent moon</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.589" end="00:15:10.980" style="s2">what arises out of that is the contents</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.269" end="00:15:13.499" style="s2">of the unconsciousness and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.980" end="00:15:15.629" style="s2">illumination you know so it&#39;s like Horus</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.499" end="00:15:18.749" style="s2">are rising from the depths it&#39;s a story</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.629" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">of transformation the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.749" end="00:15:23.239" style="s2">what matters in to illumination that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:23.239" style="s2">what that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.430" end="00:15:31.740" style="s2">so this is Jonah and what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">Jonah roughly speaking is that God told</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:35.910" style="s2">him he was supposed to go somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:38.490" style="s2">he didn&#39;t want to go there and so he got</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.910" end="00:15:41.310" style="s2">on a boat and then there was a big storm</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.490" end="00:15:43.080" style="s2">and none of the sailors knew why the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.310" end="00:15:44.610" style="s2">storm came up and Jonah finally said</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.080" end="00:15:46.470" style="s2">well it&#39;s probably my fault because God</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.610" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">told me to go do something and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:50.400" style="s2">want to do it and so God sent this storm</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:52.830" style="s2">so they take Jonah and they throw him</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.400" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">off the boat you know and he&#39;s ok with</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.830" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">that because it&#39;s his fault and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:15:57.870" style="s2">waters calm and then this big whale</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:15:59.610" style="s2">comes up and swallows them and then it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.870" end="00:16:02.610" style="s2">spits them in out on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:06.390" style="s2">three days later roughly speaking so</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.610" end="00:16:10.410" style="s2">what&#39;s the idea there well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.390" end="00:16:11.820" style="s2">complicated one the first idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.410" end="00:16:14.520" style="s2">if you&#39;re called you better listen</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.820" end="00:16:15.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the first idea and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.520" end="00:16:17.400" style="s2">people modern people never believe that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.960" end="00:16:18.660" style="s2">they&#39;re called to do anything but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.400" end="00:16:19.830" style="s2">because they&#39;re not very bright and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.660" end="00:16:21.420" style="s2">don&#39;t pay any attention and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.830" end="00:16:23.400" style="s2">perfectly well that you&#39;re called to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.420" end="00:16:25.200" style="s2">things because now and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.400" end="00:16:27.320" style="s2">that you should have said something you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.200" end="00:16:29.670" style="s2">know it like sometimes you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.320" end="00:16:31.200" style="s2">should have you said something should</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.670" end="00:16:33.330" style="s2">have you not said something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.200" end="00:16:35.190" style="s2">know so fine you&#39;re not culpable but</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.330" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">lots of times you bloody well know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:37.650" style="s2">you should have done something or you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">should have said something or you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.650" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have done something or you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:44.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have said something and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">went ahead and did it anyways well part</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.370" end="00:16:49.890" style="s2">of the moral of this story is beware of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:51.900" style="s2">doing such things you know if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.890" end="00:16:54.810" style="s2">listen something will come up from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.900" end="00:16:56.670" style="s2">depths and swallow you and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.810" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">lucky it&#39;ll spit you back up three days</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.670" end="00:17:00.030" style="s2">later but it&#39;s not necessary that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2">will it might just swallow you and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.030" end="00:17:03.540" style="s2">will be the end of that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.770" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people who are tangled up in</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.540" end="00:17:08.580" style="s2">such trouble they don&#39;t have enough life</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:11.190" style="s2">left to fix it and it&#39;s usually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.580" end="00:17:13.170" style="s2">consequence of well I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.190" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">calculate it I think it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.170" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">make a hundred bad decisions a day maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.940" style="s2">more but certainly a hundred you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:23.130" style="s2">and those hundred just bad decisions are</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.940" end="00:17:24.780" style="s2">usually sins of omission they&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.130" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">things that you know you should do and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.780" end="00:17:28.590" style="s2">then you just don&#39;t so they&#39;re things</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:30.120" style="s2">you should explore and you don&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.590" end="00:17:31.680" style="s2">things that you should say that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.120" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">don&#39;t there are obligations that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.680" end="00:17:35.730" style="s2">should undertake and you don&#39;t so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s passive avoidance in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.730" end="00:17:39.180" style="s2">it&#39;s willful blindness just like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.680" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">kind of willful blindness that doomed</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.180" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s not active repression it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">failure to engage when you know you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.850" end="00:17:50.010" style="s2">should okay you do that a hundred times</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.070" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">in a day and it&#39;s like 700 in a week and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.010" end="00:17:54.660" style="s2">it&#39;s 3,000 in a month roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s 36,000 in a year and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.660" end="00:18:01.230" style="s2">do that for 10 years that&#39;s 360,000 so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:05.550" style="s2">then you have 360,000 things lying</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.230" end="00:18:07.230" style="s2">around you that you have to fix and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.550" end="00:18:08.940" style="s2">problem is while you would even fix one</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.230" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">of those things when they popped up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.940" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s how I am at reappears right</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:15.720" style="s2">there&#39;s little monsters they pop up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:17.610" style="s2">you could whack them with a hammer like</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.720" end="00:18:20.610" style="s2">whack-a-mole no problem if you wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.260" end="00:18:44.820" style="s2">time and energy left or willpower or</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.799" end="00:20:02.260" style="s2">too bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.309" end="00:20:04.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s it is it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.260" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">bad it&#39;s really really really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.570" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">you do that long enough it&#39;s like good</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:10.500" style="s2">luck for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:14.230" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve polluted your</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.500" end="00:20:18.490" style="s2">psyche and your surroundings to such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.230" end="00:20:20.440" style="s2">degree that you can&#39;t fix it and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.490" end="00:20:22.090" style="s2">worse than that because if you stay</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.440" end="00:20:24.190" style="s2">there long enough you won&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.090" end="00:20:26.620" style="s2">fix it you&#39;ll be so angry at yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.190" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">the other person that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.620" end="00:20:31.809" style="s2">try as hard as you can to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:34.390" style="s2">you possibly can to make it as bad as</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.809" end="00:20:36.490" style="s2">you possibly can and since you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.390" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">virtually an unlimited imagination for</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:42.790" style="s2">evil it can get really bad so and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:44.890" style="s2">get into a self-sustaining spiral at</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.790" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">some point that&#39;s a that&#39;s a hellish</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.890" end="00:20:49.030" style="s2">descent and the reason that hell is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.820" style="s2">bottomless is because no matter how bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.030" end="00:20:53.320" style="s2">it is there&#39;s some damn devious nasty</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.820" end="00:20:55.980" style="s2">horrible little thing that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.320" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">that you will do that will make it worse</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.980" end="00:21:02.470" style="s2">so you know people who think that hell</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:07.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t real they&#39;re just not paying any</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.470" end="00:21:09.160" style="s2">attention at all it&#39;s plenty real so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.690" end="00:21:18.809" style="s2">there&#39;s some other representations of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.160" end="00:21:18.809" style="s2">Jonah luckily he got back up same idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.840" end="00:21:24.340" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t be in such a spectacularly</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.309" end="00:21:27.040" style="s2">successful movie if it wasn&#39;t archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.340" end="00:21:30.790" style="s2">to the core and it just relates an</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.040" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">archetypal tale so it&#39;s brave man</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.790" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">against horrific beast from the depths</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.530" end="00:21:43.750" style="s2">Greek so those are the Greeks going</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.740" end="00:21:45.100" style="s2">after the Hydra and you see the circle</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.750" end="00:21:47.260" style="s2">at the bottom of the Hydra there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.100" end="00:21:48.790" style="s2">like a symbol of infinity and so what</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.260" end="00:21:50.770" style="s2">are the Greeks doing they&#39;re tackling</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.790" end="00:21:52.450" style="s2">infinity well that is what the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.770" end="00:21:53.950" style="s2">did that&#39;s why we still remember those</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.450" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like those characters they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.950" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2">tough people then there was something</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.950" style="s2">about them that was truly remarkable you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:22:02.530" style="s2">know there was only 25,000 people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.950" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">Athens so I don&#39;t know what was up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.530" end="00:22:06.070" style="s2">them but they certainly got this part</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:10.630" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.070" end="00:22:11.860" style="s2">I guess maybe what was up with them is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.630" end="00:22:13.870" style="s2">that&#39;s how they thought of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.860" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like they&#39;re not running</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.870" end="00:22:18.600" style="s2">away you know you could make a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:20.680" style="s2">strong case that if a seven-headed snake</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.600" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">with infinite lengths came rolling</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.680" end="00:22:22.840" style="s2">towards you it&#39;s like time to head for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:25.330" style="s2">the hills</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.840" end="00:22:41.650" style="s2">right not like stand there with your</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.330" end="00:22:45.370" style="s2">bronze axe sure but it wasn&#39;t conscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.650" end="00:22:47.800" style="s2">it was mimic mimicry which is how you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.370" end="00:22:51.040" style="s2">it do you know you don&#39;t go to a movie</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.800" end="00:22:53.170" style="s2">like go iron math because Iron Man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.040" end="00:22:55.630" style="s2">mythological to the core especially the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:58.690" style="s2">Avengers movie it had a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.630" end="00:23:00.160" style="s2">mythological theme and you don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.690" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">there and watch Iron Man and then come</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.160" end="00:23:04.660" style="s2">out and say well let&#39;s decode Iron Man</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:06.970" style="s2">into his you know behavioural micro</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.660" end="00:23:10.060" style="s2">elements and incorporate those you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.970" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">do that you&#39;re gripped by it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.060" end="00:23:15.400" style="s2">gripped by it and the transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:18.310" style="s2">information is at a level that&#39;s below</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.400" end="00:23:20.410" style="s2">articulation it&#39;s imagistic so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.310" end="00:23:21.970" style="s2">it&#39;s modifying the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.410" end="00:23:25.450" style="s2">contents of your right hemisphere who</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.970" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">god only knows it&#39;s it&#39;s embodied you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.450" end="00:23:28.210" style="s2">know that&#39;s why you you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">happens you take a kid out to see a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.210" end="00:23:31.540" style="s2">Superman movie and then you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">home what do they want to do they want</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.540" end="00:23:35.290" style="s2">to put on a little Superman cape and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.130" end="00:23:37.090" style="s2">wander around being Superman you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.290" end="00:23:40.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s the level at which the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.090" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">information is being transmitted so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.360" end="00:23:44.260" style="s2">well what&#39;s Superman like well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:49.000" style="s2">play that out to the degree that you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.260" end="00:23:50.830" style="s2">play it out then the Superman element in</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.000" end="00:23:53.530" style="s2">so far as you could mimic it now becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.830" end="00:23:56.560" style="s2">part of your behavioral repertoire so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.530" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">did they know what they were doing it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.560" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">depends on what you mean by know could</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2">they fully articulate what they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:08.860" style="s2">doing no but neither can we so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.260" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">what they knew like they weren&#39;t taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.860" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">something they knew in an articulated</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.170" style="s2">form and saying let&#39;s represent it as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:15.490" style="s2">Hydra and a hero it&#39;s completely the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.170" end="00:24:16.660" style="s2">other way around it&#39;s like we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">what the hell we&#39;re doing but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.660" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">sort of like a guy with a bronze axe</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:21.940" style="s2">attacking a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:23.710" style="s2">snake it&#39;s like what kind of snake well</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.940" end="00:24:25.270" style="s2">it&#39;s an infinite snake with many heads</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.710" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">you know and that would have been a work</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.270" end="00:24:28.780" style="s2">of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:29.950" style="s2">maybe maybe conscious imagination you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.780" end="00:24:32.200" style="s2">know like because those are artistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.950" end="00:24:35.100" style="s2">productions definitely but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.200" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">products of fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.100" end="00:24:40.360" style="s2">so this chaos monster dragon breaks</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.410" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">itself into two things that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.360" end="00:24:44.590" style="s2">initial differentiation so it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:47.470" style="s2">itself into the great father and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.590" end="00:24:49.960" style="s2">great mother so that&#39;s the emergence so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.470" end="00:24:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the great mother in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:54.460" style="s2">emerges first in the great father second</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.880" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">although you can&#39;t really say that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.460" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">the way the myths work is that three</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:25:00.820" style="s2">things emerge at the same time the great</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:03.040" style="s2">mother so that&#39;s kind of the unknown as</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.820" end="00:25:06.220" style="s2">you confront it and the great father</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.040" end="00:25:08.650" style="s2">which is you as a reader and then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.220" end="00:25:10.150" style="s2">hero which is you as an active agent you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.650" end="00:25:11.800" style="s2">might say one of those precedes the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.150" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">other but that isn&#39;t how it works and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.800" end="00:25:14.740" style="s2">the myths that just says no no what soon</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">as things split that&#39;s what they split</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.740" end="00:25:20.560" style="s2">into there has to be something there has</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:23.130" style="s2">to be the interpretation of something</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.560" end="00:25:25.720" style="s2">and there has to be the interpreter</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.130" end="00:25:28.900" style="s2">those are the fundamental elements of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.720" end="00:25:30.430" style="s2">being and so it&#39;s an it&#39;s an idea the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.900" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">fundamental elements of being are</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.430" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a pool of information there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">reader of the information so that would</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:39.220" style="s2">be horse iris roughly speaking and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:40.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a reader and so think about what</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.220" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re reading a book you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.860" end="00:25:44.560" style="s2">know you might say well where is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:47.710" style="s2">book and you say well here&#39;s the book</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.560" end="00:25:51.220" style="s2">it&#39;s this little chunk of wood fiber</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.710" end="00:25:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like well no that&#39;s what your</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.220" end="00:25:55.390" style="s2">visual system deludes you into thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.800" end="00:25:57.730" style="s2">when you&#39;re using it that&#39;s not the book</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.390" end="00:25:59.950" style="s2">at all the book contains patterns</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.730" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">it contains representations of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.950" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">behavioral patterns and the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2">interpret those behavioral patterns is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.620" style="s2">by using the reader that&#39;s in your head</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:10.510" style="s2">which is really that structure that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.620" end="00:26:12.190" style="s2">hierarchical structure that I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.510" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">about because if you didn&#39;t have that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.190" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">your damn head you couldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:17.830" style="s2">the book because the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.250" end="00:26:21.010" style="s2">like if you and I are talking and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.830" end="00:26:22.630" style="s2">communicating there&#39;s a log we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.010" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">agree on before we can even say anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.630" end="00:26:27.820" style="s2">about which we might disagree so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:29.980" style="s2">writing a book for you people as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.820" end="00:26:31.720" style="s2">readers what I have to do is assume a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.980" end="00:26:32.950" style="s2">bunch of things that you know because</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.720" end="00:26:35.230" style="s2">then I don&#39;t have to say though</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.950" end="00:26:36.970" style="s2">things because it would take an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.230" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">amount of time to say everything that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.970" end="00:26:40.659" style="s2">need to say so I have to assume that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a trillion things I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.659" end="00:26:44.260" style="s2">to say because I already know that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:46.600" style="s2">know them and so then I can play at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.260" end="00:26:50.769" style="s2">fringes with those things so for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.600" end="00:26:52.659" style="s2">I can lay out a story about my character</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.769" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">becoming angry and I don&#39;t have to like</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.659" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">tell you you know well we could tell</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:58.750" style="s2">he&#39;s angry because his his brow is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.980" end="00:27:00.130" style="s2">furrowed and you know he&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.750" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">sweat and there&#39;s a bad taste in his</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.130" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">mouth and if you&#39;re angry that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:05.289" style="s2">feel and because you already know all</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.179" style="s2">that so I don&#39;t have to bother with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.289" end="00:27:09.010" style="s2">I can just say you know what you just</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.179" end="00:27:10.269" style="s2">set up the situation and poof you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.010" end="00:27:12.340" style="s2">what anger means you know what sorrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.269" end="00:27:17.889" style="s2">means you know what love means etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.340" end="00:27:20.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s why the reader has to be there</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.889" end="00:27:22.360" style="s2">and the thing to read sorry the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.260" end="00:27:24.130" style="s2">structure the interpreter has to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.360" end="00:27:26.830" style="s2">there and the thing that&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.130" end="00:27:28.179" style="s2">interpreter interpretation and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.830" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">that&#39;s being interpreted have to all</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.179" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">come out at the same time poof and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:35.529" style="s2">that&#39;s the the hero the great mother and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:38.470" style="s2">the great father so that&#39;s how they pop</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.529" end="00:27:43.419" style="s2">out now let me show you some cool things</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.470" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">there they are now students sent me the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.419" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">one on the left that&#39;s an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">Chinese representation and then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:50.500" style="s2">one&#39;s Greek it&#39;s so cool look at that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.029" style="s2">you have the dragon in the background</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.500" end="00:27:54.429" style="s2">the snake with the knot in its tail</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.029" end="00:27:56.409" style="s2">that&#39;s ancient Greek that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.429" end="00:27:59.169" style="s2">it&#39;s Chinese it&#39;s a very old Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.409" end="00:28:02.590" style="s2">representation and out of the snake pops</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.169" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">the divine parents well why is that well</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.590" end="00:28:07.690" style="s2">it&#39;s partly because that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:09.519" style="s2">primary things that emerges out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.690" end="00:28:11.980" style="s2">undifferentiated reality for human</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.519" end="00:28:13.570" style="s2">beings is the male and the female the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.980" end="00:28:15.159" style="s2">father and the mother I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.570" end="00:28:17.740" style="s2">first things you come into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.159" end="00:28:21.669" style="s2">roughly speaking when you emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.740" end="00:28:23.380" style="s2">the void and that&#39;s archetypal we know</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.669" end="00:28:26.350" style="s2">who a father is we know who a mother is</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.380" end="00:28:31.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s the differentiation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.350" end="00:28:35.049" style="s2">the genders what time is it yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.570" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s leave it there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.049" end="00:28:38.980" style="s2">good now we&#39;ve got into the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">and the great father and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.980" end="00:28:42.879" style="s2">show you their symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.740" style="s2">and their positive because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.879" end="00:28:46.810" style="s2">things that happens is you get the great</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:47.860" style="s2">mother and the great father pop up and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.810" end="00:28:49.780" style="s2">the next thing is that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.860" end="00:28:51.550" style="s2">differentiate again and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.780" end="00:28:53.500" style="s2">differentiate into positive mother and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.550" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">negative mother and paused a farther a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.500" end="00:28:58.900" style="s2">negative father and then out and then at</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.810" end="00:29:00.970" style="s2">the same time the cross the product of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.900" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">those two things which is the hero that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.970" end="00:29:06.280" style="s2">also emerges and it&#39;s differentiates</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:09.460" style="s2">into the hero and the adversary and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.280" end="00:29:10.750" style="s2">then you have you have enough at that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:12.460" style="s2">point you have enough Tiff&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.750" end="00:29:14.290" style="s2">differentiation at that point in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.460" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2">of representation that you can basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.290" end="00:29:19.270" style="s2">encapsulate the whole world and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.500" end="00:29:21.720" style="s2">that&#39;s at the base of our conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.270" end="00:29:21.720" style="s2">structures</p>
