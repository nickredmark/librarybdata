<p begin="00:00:00.380" end="00:00:05.400" style="s2">okay so this is episode two of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.210" end="00:00:07.020" style="s2">youtube experiment and today what I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.400" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">to do is I wanted to talk about what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.020" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">have long thought is in fact one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">most important concepts in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">contemporary environment and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">least talked about and least well</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">understood and this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">distinction between rival rest&#39;s Goods</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">arrivals phenomena and anti rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">phenomena I think this this concept by</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">itself if fully grasped may be the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">important one out there so on that note</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">let&#39;s start so the rival risk is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">straightforward it consists of things</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">like hamburgers and glasses of water and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">oil where if I have it you don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:56.420" style="s2">and if I have consumed it then it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">forever all right so these are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.420" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">fundamentally not shareable and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:07.010" style="s2">fundamentally entropic kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s I think it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.010" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">most if not all of our economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">structures and to a great extent many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">our legal and political structures for</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">say the past 15 thousand years have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">about trying to solve the problem of how</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">do we most effectively which sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">means most equitable and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">means most productively generate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">distribute rather loose goods right I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">mean for most of human history the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">problem of how do we feed people has</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">been the problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.550" end="00:01:45.670" style="s2">contemporary or at least say late</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.530" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">seventies economical political</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.670" end="00:01:52.120" style="s2">structures being the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">figured out thus far now the the anti</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.120" end="00:01:59.860" style="s2">rival risk is very importantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">completely different in kind it is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.860" end="00:02:06.400" style="s2">set of things where if I have it you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">also get a completely functional copy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.400" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">it without me losing it at all and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">actually even more importantly the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:18.100" style="s2">people who have it the more valuable it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:19.990" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.100" end="00:02:23.710" style="s2">you know the canonical example here</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.990" end="00:02:25.960" style="s2">would be something like say language or</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.710" end="00:02:28.180" style="s2">a telecommunications network like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.960" end="00:02:30.250" style="s2">Internet you know if I&#39;m the only person</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.180" end="00:02:33.010" style="s2">who speaks Esperanto it&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.250" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">anything but if I teach you Esperanto</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.010" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">which has some cost but the cost of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">is is minuscule compared to the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:43.240" style="s2">creating the language in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:44.410" style="s2">it gets more violent of course every</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.240" end="00:02:46.090" style="s2">additional person gets added to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.410" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">network increases the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.090" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">network exponentially arises this</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:51.940" style="s2">Metcalfe&#39;s law and sort of a more</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:54.670" style="s2">fundamental notion of what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.940" end="00:03:00.100" style="s2">things intrinsically participate in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.670" end="00:03:01.690" style="s2">Metcalfe&#39;s law okay so the first insight</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:04.540" style="s2">once you have this distinction is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.690" end="00:03:07.180" style="s2">recognize that a lot of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.540" end="00:03:09.160" style="s2">concepts that we apply and use to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.180" end="00:03:12.070" style="s2">good choices in the domain of the rival</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.160" end="00:03:15.190" style="s2">risk actually don&#39;t work at all in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.070" end="00:03:17.709" style="s2">domain of the antivirus for deep reasons</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.190" end="00:03:21.070" style="s2">so for example let&#39;s take the micro</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.709" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">economic concepts supply and demand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.070" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">price function in a rival risk domain</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">where the cost of production is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">asymptotically related in some fixed way</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.290" end="00:03:40.540" style="s2">to the value meaning that even though</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:43.330" style="s2">you can get more and more efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.540" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">say producing a car the production of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.330" end="00:03:50.770" style="s2">car has some fixed relatively fixed cost</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:53.770" style="s2">and as a consequence there is a point at</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.770" end="00:03:55.420" style="s2">which it just doesn&#39;t make sense to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.770" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">more cars the incremental marginal value</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.420" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">of the new car</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">less than the incremental marginal value</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">started marginal cost of creating a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:04.349" style="s2">car and this is good - characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:05.580" style="s2">characteristic of all kinds of rivals</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.349" end="00:04:09.209" style="s2">phenomena there&#39;s just a crossover point</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.580" end="00:04:10.739" style="s2">where it costs too much to make more in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.209" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">the relationship to the amount of value</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.739" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">that you can generate out of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">there seems to be an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">decreasing returns to scale so that any</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:26.040" style="s2">in any given technological framework you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:28.110" style="s2">could squeeze a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.040" end="00:04:31.010" style="s2">efficiency out of your production path</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.110" end="00:04:33.780" style="s2">and then you reach an asymptotic limit</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.010" end="00:04:35.669" style="s2">now of course we we can continually move</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.780" end="00:04:37.500" style="s2">into new kinds of technological</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.669" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">frameworks and we&#39;ll speak about that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">a moment but once you&#39;re in one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:46.860" style="s2">where you&#39;re stuck and in this context</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">the price function actually ends up</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.860" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">being a perfectly efficient way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">identifying what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:58.050" style="s2">combination of where an individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">should point their attention meaning if</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.050" end="00:05:00.690" style="s2">I want to figure out what I should do</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:02.010" style="s2">all I have to do is look for the places</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:03.479" style="s2">where I can make the most money if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.010" end="00:05:06.210" style="s2">economy says that I make more money</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.479" end="00:05:09.030" style="s2">being a elementary school teacher or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:10.950" style="s2">being a coal miner then that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">should do at least within the domains of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:16.590" style="s2">what microeconomics can accomplish and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:18.750" style="s2">also it serves as the mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.590" end="00:05:21.389" style="s2">motivation of that same behavior and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.750" end="00:05:23.160" style="s2">if I want to buy stuff then I need money</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.389" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">and the way that I get money is by doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:28.199" style="s2">the stuff that the economy says is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:30.750" style="s2">value and so this is Orthodox economics</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.199" end="00:05:33.389" style="s2">and at least within the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.750" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">rival risk it more or less works I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.389" end="00:05:37.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of fuzziness outside of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">the notion of a perfect economy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.470" end="00:05:44.610" style="s2">still a good good theory and the price</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">function is effective now the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.610" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t work at all in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.590" end="00:05:49.590" style="s2">antivirus and this is I think important</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it doesn&#39;t work a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.590" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">bit we can kind of clued you to make it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.180" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:05:56.130" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the opposite direction so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">for example we have tried to clear the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.130" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">entire concept of intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">the notion of creating rival ristmas to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">creating scarcity around fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:09.300" style="s2">anti robbers things like ideas is our</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.200" end="00:06:10.200" style="s2">effort to shoehorn the anti Rawal risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.300" end="00:06:12.390" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.200" end="00:06:16.920" style="s2">rival wrist legal economic and political</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.390" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">frameworks so how do we tell people how</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.920" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">valuable it is to create new ideas well</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:22.290" style="s2">if all we&#39;ve got is supplying a minute</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:25.140" style="s2">the price function we have to turn these</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.290" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">new ideas into the functional equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.140" end="00:06:28.470" style="s2">of a barrel of oil into the functional</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:30.180" style="s2">equivalent of a ham sandwich there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:32.420" style="s2">only so much that can go around its</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.180" end="00:06:36.480" style="s2">scarce and so the price function works</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.420" end="00:06:39.480" style="s2">the problem is since the the marginal</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.480" end="00:06:42.210" style="s2">cost of copying say something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.480" end="00:06:43.890" style="s2">calculus is effectively de minimis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.210" end="00:06:46.470" style="s2">effectively zero and the marginal value</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.890" end="00:06:47.970" style="s2">is not just the value that a nurse to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.470" end="00:06:50.220" style="s2">the individual who gets it right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.970" end="00:06:52.530" style="s2">there if I don&#39;t know calculus is value</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.530" end="00:06:56.220" style="s2">there&#39;s also the Metcalfe&#39;s law which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.090" end="00:06:58.980" style="s2">that calculus in general gets more</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.220" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">valuable to literally everyone the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.980" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">people who have it so what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">that to put a very fine point on it you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:12.030" style="s2">should be willing to pay me to learn</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:14.070" style="s2">calculus at least some amount and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.030" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">fact as a community we should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.070" end="00:07:19.170" style="s2">collectively willing to pay effectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">anyone to learn calculus because the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.170" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">net-net value to the whole to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:27.090" style="s2">community is going up exponentially and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.770" style="s2">the marginal cost of learning it is in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.090" end="00:07:30.570" style="s2">fact asymptotically going down there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.770" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">some flat level and there&#39;s specific</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.570" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">reasons which has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:36.660" style="s2">relationship between the rival risk and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:37.980" style="s2">the anti rivalries I guess if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.660" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">followed me this far it might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.980" end="00:07:40.680" style="s2">diving into that a little bit I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">apologize that this is getting a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.680" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">convoluted I don&#39;t have enough skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">and video to edit this this is all being</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">taken in one splurge</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">so we talked earlier about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:53.550" style="s2">the way that you might move from one</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:55.620" style="s2">technical regime to another technical</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.550" end="00:07:57.570" style="s2">regime and right now we&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">what are the actual limits of where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.570" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">answer driver is doesn&#39;t reduce to zero</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:04.650" style="s2">copying costs and this is just where</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:07.620" style="s2">those two pieces relate so the anti</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.650" end="00:08:10.230" style="s2">rival risk is how we innovate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.620" end="00:08:13.160" style="s2">develop new technical regimes so when a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">given rival economy shifts to a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.160" end="00:08:18.690" style="s2">fundamental capacity it does so on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:20.670" style="s2">basis of some anti robbery&#39;s innovation</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.690" end="00:08:22.230" style="s2">and somebody in events invents the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.670" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">somebody invents the steam engine</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.230" end="00:08:26.940" style="s2">somebody invents electricity</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.360" end="00:08:28.590" style="s2">which is an anti rivalries phenomenon to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.940" end="00:08:30.600" style="s2">change the underlying basis upon which</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.590" end="00:08:33.810" style="s2">the entire robbery&#39;s economy operates</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.600" end="00:08:36.330" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one side of it innovation</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:38.219" style="s2">waves are the anti rivalry is feeding</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.330" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2">back on the rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.219" end="00:08:46.410" style="s2">contrariwise the amount of irreducible</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:50.070" style="s2">energy that is necessary for a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.410" end="00:08:54.210" style="s2">the anti rather is to be written to a an</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.070" end="00:08:58.440" style="s2">agent is the the rival hrus constraining</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.210" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">the the effectiveness or the propagation</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.440" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">of the anti robber so you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">takes a human being say a year to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">Chinese then the amount of actual</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:13.050" style="s2">rivalries energy of feeding that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">individual housing that individual and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.050" end="00:09:17.580" style="s2">maintaining the integrity of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:20.700" style="s2">intention and the opportunity cost of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.580" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">doing just that is the rivalry substrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.700" end="00:09:25.980" style="s2">against which the antivirus is working</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:31.589" style="s2">ok so now we get to the last point why</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.980" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">is this the crown jewel well you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.589" end="00:09:36.890" style="s2">be able to get so the the anti rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:39.690" style="s2">is the crown jewel because of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.890" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">exponential it is the thing that causes</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.690" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">the exponential to show up at all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">once you&#39;ve developed once one person</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:50.820" style="s2">has done the work of developing calculus</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">it is almost free for everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.820" end="00:09:55.080" style="s2">which means that the next group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">people who are coming don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.080" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">reinvent calculus they just learn it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:01.290" style="s2">then they get to use it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">get to innovate on top of it so rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.290" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">than constantly investing most of your</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:09.270" style="s2">energy and merely reproducing a constant</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:13.320" style="s2">state every iteration of generativity is</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:19.770" style="s2">generates Exponential&#39;s now if you take</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.339" end="00:10:22.740" style="s2">that fact and you combine it with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.770" end="00:10:24.839" style="s2">recognition that our entire social</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:33.740" style="s2">see the opportunity if we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.220" end="00:10:36.530" style="s2">how to construct a social framework</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.740" end="00:10:39.740" style="s2">which is optimized for the anti-rattle</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.520" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">an exponential any increase is a massive</p>
