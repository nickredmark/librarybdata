<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:57.799" style="s2">of the practice what&#39;s going on in the</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:12.730" style="s2">time for Q&amp;A so let&#39;s remember that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:15.970" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make this</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.730" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">as much a whole-body experience when</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.970" end="00:02:21.190" style="s2">we&#39;re chanting you should be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">feel you know what it&#39;s like to feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.190" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">music in your body alright there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">obviously a physical aspect in what</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:28.900" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling music but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:30.760" style="s2">the psychological aspect in which you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.900" end="00:02:32.980" style="s2">you&#39;re catching the rhythm you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.760" end="00:02:35.620" style="s2">picking up on the cadence right and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.980" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">you want to be feeling it in your body</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.620" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">in both the psychological and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">physiological sense and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">important for example when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">the ohm right that there&#39;s the deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:47.739" style="s2">resonance and you and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:49.780" style="s2">feeling you feeling it both</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.739" end="00:02:52.120" style="s2">psychologically and physiologically and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.780" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">it&#39;s that deep resonance and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.120" end="00:02:59.560" style="s2">feeling that grounding and right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:01.780" style="s2">the sort of embodied aspect of it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.560" end="00:03:04.510" style="s2">embedded aspect and then deeper the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.780" end="00:03:06.790" style="s2">ontological it&#39;s an enacted symbol for</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.510" end="00:03:10.810" style="s2">how everything is emerging from the</p>

<p begin="00:03:10.810" end="00:03:16.079" style="s2">emphasis therefore on Eastern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:21.850" style="s2">when we do the one and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.350" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">resonate you&#39;re trying to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">oneness of all things it&#39;s a higher note</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:29.079" style="s2">and in that sense it&#39;s enacting the an</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:32.680" style="s2">agog a and then what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.079" end="00:03:38.069" style="s2">feel there is right that oneness and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.680" end="00:03:41.709" style="s2">it&#39;s the overarching logos the</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.709" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">principle from which everything emanates</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:48.880" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the emergence from the</p>

<p begin="00:03:48.880" end="00:03:54.310" style="s2">course these are metaphors and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.120" end="00:03:57.730" style="s2">should be understood as that through</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:14.139" style="s2">so as I&#39;ve said I think Lexi o Divina</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.709" end="00:04:17.789" style="s2">just also principles of designing an</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">so I think I see</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">as taking us from the linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:37.640" style="s2">conceptual into the depths of mindful</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:39.770" style="s2">awareness and attention and then I see</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">Lexi o is helping to bridge out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.770" end="00:04:47.540" style="s2">mindfulness practice into a</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.130" end="00:30:38.710" style="s2">briefed me originally needs to shine</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.970" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">will shift around for you because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.710" end="00:30:44.950" style="s2">have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">and this is something that hunter is</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:51.940" style="s2">very good on but also people like Harmon</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:55.930" style="s2">The Shining is always interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:59.500" style="s2">with the withdrawing when we really</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.930" end="00:31:01.330" style="s2">relate to someone as a dhow they shine</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.500" end="00:31:03.070" style="s2">their morna&#39;s shines and they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.330" end="00:31:04.630" style="s2">intelligible to us but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.070" end="00:31:07.270" style="s2">simultaneous with they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.630" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2">withdrawing and there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.270" end="00:31:15.070" style="s2">that which is a mysterious that&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:18.130" style="s2">with always beyond our grasp so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.070" end="00:31:22.540" style="s2">shining and the withdrawing are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.130" end="00:31:26.020" style="s2">interdependent and so sometimes the</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.020" end="00:31:33.970" style="s2">forth and more but sometimes that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.800" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">withdrawing my aspect the the sacred</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.040" end="00:31:46.300" style="s2">not shiny precisely because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.170" end="00:31:49.390" style="s2">withdrawing aspect needs to be more</p>
