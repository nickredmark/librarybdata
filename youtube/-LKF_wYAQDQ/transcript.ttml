<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">necessarily an expert audience and AI</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">could you tell us what AGI is and how it</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">differs from narrow AI and why the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">emergence of AGI is so significant yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">when the AI field began in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">the last century the basic informally</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:30.350" style="s2">understood goal with Street intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">of kind of the same type that people had</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.350" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">then during the next few decades it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">discovered that was possible to create</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">software hardware systems doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">particular things that seemed very</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">intelligent when people did them but</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">doing these things in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">way from how people did them and doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">them in a much more you know narrowly</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.210" style="s2">defined way so I mean in the 50s it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">wasn&#39;t clear that you know would make</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.210" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">sense to make a program that could play</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">chess as well as a grandmaster but</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t approach it anything like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">grandmaster did and couldn&#39;t play you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">know Scrabble or checkers at all without</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">some reprogramming so the existence of</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">defined ways very different from our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.040" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2">human suitum I mean this was it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:20.790" style="s2">really a major discovery which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.180" end="00:02:23.069" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s left us in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.790" end="00:02:26.930" style="s2">situation now that I think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.069" end="00:02:29.909" style="s2">narrow AI revolution where we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.930" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">astounding variety of systems that can</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.909" end="00:02:35.189" style="s2">do particular very intelligent seeming</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">things yet they&#39;re not doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:40.019" style="s2">like how people did it and as part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">that difference from our people did it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.019" end="00:02:45.239" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not able to generalize</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">they&#39;re intelligent function beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.239" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">very narrow class of contacts and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:55.109" style="s2">introduced the term AG AI artificial</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">general intelligence 15 years ago or so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.109" end="00:02:59.579" style="s2">with a view toward distinguishing</p>

<p begin="00:03:21.569" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">because I mean to achieve general</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">years and there are very few serious AI</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">have gone way down so I mean 10 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.720" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">years ago there was a small percent of</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.930" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">it seems to me that one could at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:07:00.130" style="s2">at one level divide AGI approaches into</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:02.320" style="s2">uploads slash emulations and software</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.130" end="00:07:04.539" style="s2">approaches to just maybe speak a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.320" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">bit about your thoughts on those two</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.539" end="00:07:11.220" style="s2">broadly different ways of achieving AGI</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:15.340" style="s2">I think right now the idea of achieving</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.220" end="00:07:17.979" style="s2">AGI via an upload or emulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.340" end="00:07:20.380" style="s2">human brain is really just an idea I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.979" end="00:07:22.360" style="s2">mean it&#39;s an idea that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.380" end="00:07:24.159" style="s2">scientifically feasible according to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.360" end="00:07:28.389" style="s2">known laws of physics but there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.159" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">no one working directly on that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.389" end="00:07:32.470" style="s2">are people working on supporting</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:35.110" style="s2">technologies that could eventually lead</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.470" end="00:07:37.000" style="s2">you to be able to scan the brain Acula</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:39.220" style="s2">enough that you could start seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.000" end="00:07:42.759" style="s2">working on that but right now we just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.220" end="00:07:45.610" style="s2">don&#39;t have the brain scanning tech to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.759" end="00:07:48.340" style="s2">scan the mind out of a living brain and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.610" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the reconstructive tech to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.340" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">take a dead brain like freeze it slice</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">it scan and then reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.919" style="s2">dynamics of that brain I mean in theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">you could do that by the laws of physics</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.919" end="00:08:02.289" style="s2">but we&#39;re way without speaking of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:05.409" style="s2">estimates and we were very far away in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.289" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">terms of tools and concepts from being</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.409" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">able to do that right now worse the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">attempt to create a GI via software be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">very loosely brain inspired software</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:18.520" style="s2">like current deep neural nets or more</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.590" style="s2">math and cognitive science inspired</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.520" end="00:08:24.099" style="s2">software like OpenCog I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.590" end="00:08:26.349" style="s2">prospect of getting AGI by software this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.099" end="00:08:29.289" style="s2">is a subject of like really concrete</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.349" end="00:08:31.690" style="s2">research projects now so it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.289" end="00:08:33.550" style="s2">much more than an idea I mean it may be</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.690" end="00:08:36.290" style="s2">that all these projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.550" end="00:08:38.419" style="s2">wrongheaded but at least we&#39;re directly</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.290" end="00:08:40.790" style="s2">working on the problem right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.419" end="00:08:43.070" style="s2">so I mean conceptually you could divide</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.790" end="00:08:45.050" style="s2">AGI into those two approaches but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.070" end="00:08:47.090" style="s2">say those two approaches are there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.050" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">very different practical status at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.090" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">moment at one point I made when I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.130" end="00:08:54.860" style="s2">talking with Robin is that the upload</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:55.790" style="s2">emulation approach is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.860" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">all-or-nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.790" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">either you can upload him a brain maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">not a human brain but a full brain and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:03.110" style="s2">make it work like it&#39;s supposed to or</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:05.300" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.110" end="00:09:06.890" style="s2">while the software world one can see in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.300" end="00:09:10.460" style="s2">fact we obviously are already seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.890" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">lots of incremental benefits and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.460" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">know for my experience in the business</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:16.370" style="s2">world the investment world</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">I generally guide people away from</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.370" end="00:09:21.500" style="s2">trying to jump up a cliff right go from</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:23.870" style="s2">zero to a hundred in one single project</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.500" end="00:09:26.810" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite a fair</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:29.090" style="s2">assessment because I think the missing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.810" end="00:09:31.820" style="s2">link for being able to mind upload</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.090" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">people or simulate people in detail I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.820" end="00:09:36.860" style="s2">mean the missing links are the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:38.840" style="s2">kind of hardware / wetware and on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.860" end="00:09:40.610" style="s2">other hand the right kind of brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.840" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">scanning equipment and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.610" end="00:09:45.020" style="s2">incremental approaches toward you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:46.940" style="s2">brain like hardware or wetware and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.020" end="00:09:48.440" style="s2">toward really stretch you too broadly</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.940" end="00:09:51.170" style="s2">accurate brain scanning</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.440" end="00:09:53.540" style="s2">I think you know those advances would</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.170" end="00:09:55.880" style="s2">lead to a lot of amazing incremental</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.540" end="00:09:57.380" style="s2">achievements I mean get making advances</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.880" end="00:10:00.020" style="s2">and that kind of hardware or wetware</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.380" end="00:10:02.540" style="s2">will probably do a lot of funky narrow</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.020" end="00:10:04.300" style="s2">machines doing robot control or</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">perception there&#39;s something and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.300" end="00:10:08.900" style="s2">advances in brain scanning would lead to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:10.700" style="s2">amazing progress in you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.900" end="00:10:13.700" style="s2">understanding how the human mind works</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.700" end="00:10:16.010" style="s2">and diagnosing diseases the brain and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.700" end="00:10:17.780" style="s2">on so I think incremental progress in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.010" end="00:10:20.330" style="s2">that direction could be valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.780" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">reasons other than building AI systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.330" end="00:10:24.050" style="s2">and you know it might be valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:26.300" style="s2">building animal level eyes too right if</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.050" end="00:10:29.240" style="s2">you want to build an artificial rodent</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.300" end="00:10:31.160" style="s2">or a bug or something then progress is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.240" end="00:10:33.590" style="s2">scanning organisms and emulating them</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.160" end="00:10:35.080" style="s2">can be pretty interesting also so I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.590" end="00:10:36.519" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.080" end="00:10:38.769" style="s2">and by any means it&#39;s it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.519" end="00:10:40.899" style="s2">interesting I just think right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.769" end="00:10:43.060" style="s2">that&#39;s about the research on supporting</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.899" end="00:10:46.209" style="s2">technologies rather than about mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.060" end="00:10:48.250" style="s2">uploading per say a brain emulation per</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.209" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">se yeah I thought you make some good</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.250" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">points and that suggests that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:54.790" style="s2">likely to see both tracks gradually</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:55.329" style="s2">attract more and more resources as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.790" end="00:10:58.300" style="s2">get to it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.329" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">I would say like brain scanning needs a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.300" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">breakthrough right it needs a radical</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:06.519" style="s2">breakthrough in imaging or else a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2">radical breakthrough in extrapolating</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.519" end="00:11:11.910" style="s2">the dynamics of the brain forward giving</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.620" end="00:11:15.399" style="s2">a static snapshot and it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.910" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">obvious that Adi needs a radically</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.399" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">different sort of technology than what</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">now exists I mean it it might but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">not obvious as it is for for brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:26.260" style="s2">emulation I think people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.300" style="s2">building the technology but who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:31.180" style="s2">speculating about it they like the brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.300" end="00:11:34.149" style="s2">emulation idea because it&#39;s a proof of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.180" end="00:11:35.800" style="s2">principle right it just like the bird is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.149" end="00:11:37.510" style="s2">a proof of principle that a flying</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.800" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">machine can be built out of molecules</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.510" end="00:11:42.760" style="s2">but then as we all know that the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">proof of principle isn&#39;t always the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.760" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">way to build something in nanotech is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:48.790" style="s2">good example that I mean in Derek</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:50.890" style="s2">Drexler&#39;s initial books on nanotech I</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.790" end="00:11:53.230" style="s2">mean he was making all these pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.890" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">gears and pulleys and you know now that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.230" end="00:11:56.950" style="s2">structures have looked like big machines</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">that we make and that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.950" end="00:12:00.670" style="s2">approach to take if you want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.680" style="s2">first proof of principle that a nano</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.670" end="00:12:04.690" style="s2">machines could exists but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.680" end="00:12:06.190" style="s2">becoming clear the way nanotech is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.690" end="00:12:08.770" style="s2">probably gonna work is a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.190" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">molecular biology ish but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.770" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">harder way to work out details in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:14.980" style="s2">proof of principle type way but it may</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:17.410" style="s2">be a more artful way to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.980" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">the machines work so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.410" end="00:12:22.089" style="s2">not bad if you&#39;re a proof of principle</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:24.279" style="s2">system ends up totally different than</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.089" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">the system you actually build but of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.279" end="00:12:29.260" style="s2">course also my double earnings interest</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:30.940" style="s2">and Yas cos were humans right and even</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.260" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">if that&#39;s the most awkward way to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.940" end="00:12:35.649" style="s2">AGI from the perspective of making the</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.029" end="00:12:44.649" style="s2">would love to have you know a mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.010" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">upload of Friedrich Nietzsche or philip</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.630" end="00:13:03.720" style="s2">however yeah I&#39;m more drawn to more</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.449" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">heterogeneous approaches that no</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.720" end="00:13:08.040" style="s2">leverage what we know about the</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.970" end="00:13:17.399" style="s2">approach can take I mean the current</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.519" end="00:13:19.110" style="s2">hardware we have is very little like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.399" end="00:13:21.899" style="s2">brain unless you did get super high</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.110" end="00:13:24.509" style="s2">level loops of abstraction I mean we now</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.899" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">understand a lot about how to do some</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.509" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">types of intelligent activities like</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.160" end="00:13:40.259" style="s2">think about how to create AGI in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.649" end="00:13:42.209" style="s2">that leverages this hardware that we</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:52.500" style="s2">leads you to a more opportunistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.009" end="00:13:53.880" style="s2">approach to AGI where you say well how</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.500" end="00:13:56.190" style="s2">can we put together the various</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.880" end="00:13:58.260" style="s2">technologies we have now including</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.540" end="00:14:10.949" style="s2">intelligence so man you&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.790" end="00:14:13.889" style="s2">on the OpenCog project for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.949" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">years which is an approach to AGI that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.889" end="00:14:17.399" style="s2">quite different from the deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:19.529" style="s2">approach we hear about so much about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.399" end="00:14:22.949" style="s2">media could you tell us about OpenCog</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.529" end="00:14:25.100" style="s2">the history of it and what it is so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.949" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">history of OpenCog goes back before</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.100" end="00:14:29.550" style="s2">OpenCog I mean it goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:32.819" style="s2">mid-90s when I started thinking about I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.550" end="00:14:36.689" style="s2">could make an AI which was a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.819" end="00:14:39.209" style="s2">agent system that was a society of mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.689" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">as Marvin Minsky had described it but</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.209" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">with more of a focus on emergence so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:45.779" style="s2">Marvin Minsky viewed the mind the human</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:48.269" style="s2">mind is an artificial mind there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.779" end="00:14:48.930" style="s2">collection of AI agents that each carry</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.930" end="00:14:53.370" style="s2">particular form of intelligence but they</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.760" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">are interacting with each other much</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.370" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">like people in the society interact with</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.200" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">each other within the intelligence came</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">out the overall society I like this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:03.870" style="s2">because I like self-organizing systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:06.390" style="s2">and I thought this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.870" end="00:15:08.430" style="s2">self-organizing complex system might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.390" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">the right kind of mind like behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.430" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">but when I dug into it more I realized</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:15.420" style="s2">Marvin Minsky didn&#39;t like emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:17.850" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like nonlinear dynamics at</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.420" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">least not in an AI or cognitive science</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.950" end="00:15:39.300" style="s2">code myself a system called web mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.500" end="00:15:41.550" style="s2">which will be a bunch of agents</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.220" end="00:15:51.690" style="s2">yield emergent intelligence we did some</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.290" end="00:15:53.970" style="s2">amazing prototyping in the company in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.690" end="00:15:56.910" style="s2">New York I formed web mind incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">but then no we failed to make a success</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">effort and ran out of money when the.com</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.870" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">boom crash in 2001 and I then started</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.070" style="s2">building a system called the novo</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.040" end="00:16:18.209" style="s2">then the singularity network each of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.529" end="00:16:21.029" style="s2">these reflects different aspects of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.209" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">we were trying to do in web mind so web</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.029" end="00:16:24.660" style="s2">mind was really a bunch of agents which</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:26.550" style="s2">was sort of heterogeneous that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.660" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">supposed to cooperate to form an</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:35.310" style="s2">more so we have a knowledge graph which</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.720" end="00:19:57.960" style="s2">from you guys and thought about it a bit</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.669" end="00:20:49.020" style="s2">absolutely I mean the concept of</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.110" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">the the example he mentioned certainly</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.620" end="00:21:20.390" style="s2">is an important one and I&#39;d say and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:23.000" style="s2">there are science analogy current deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.390" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">learning networks for vision or audition</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.000" end="00:21:27.620" style="s2">probably model well what the human brain</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.920" end="00:21:49.670" style="s2">course you could attempt it in a neural</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.540" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">net architecture by taking in their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.670" end="00:21:53.810" style="s2">net with a long term declarative memory</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.610" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">something being worked on a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.440" end="00:22:04.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve been working toward doing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:07.310" style="s2">sort of thing in OpenCog where you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.670" end="00:22:09.410" style="s2">a symbolic cognitive engine atoms face</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.310" end="00:22:11.720" style="s2">and pln and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.410" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">interacting with a deep neural net for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.720" end="00:22:15.950" style="s2">doing perception we&#39;ve done some simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:18.380" style="s2">experiments in that regard and there</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.950" end="00:22:21.010" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of tweaking we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.380" end="00:22:23.510" style="s2">to do to the OpenCog atom space</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.010" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">framework not so much the added space as</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:27.400" style="s2">a representational tool but to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:29.240" style="s2">pattern matcher which is a key</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.400" end="00:22:31.310" style="s2">operational tool on top of the atom</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.240" end="00:22:33.100" style="s2">space so a lot of tweaks we&#39;ve had to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.310" end="00:22:36.020" style="s2">the pattern matcher to make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.100" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">interactively in real time with deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.020" end="00:22:39.620" style="s2">neural networks but we&#39;re mostly through</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:42.680" style="s2">that now and I&#39;ve been doing some</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.620" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">interesting experiments in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.680" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve suggested and I think this can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:52.160" style="s2">valuable in natural language processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">also where I mean we have Bert Ernie</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.160" end="00:22:55.580" style="s2">these various even neural net</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:59.090" style="s2">architectures doing a great job at</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.580" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">recognizing various complex statistical</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.090" end="00:23:03.980" style="s2">patterns in natural language text so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.690" style="s2">that they can then you know emulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.980" end="00:23:07.770" style="s2">natural language in a way that looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.690" end="00:23:09.779" style="s2">realistic in the short run yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.770" end="00:23:12.450" style="s2">clearly they&#39;re not getting the overall</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.779" end="00:23:14.490" style="s2">meaning of a document or the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.450" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">semantics of what&#39;s being said but you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.490" end="00:23:20.070" style="s2">can see in the indian meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">aspects of their generated text over a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.070" end="00:23:26.760" style="s2">medium tough medium scale of text length</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been working on combining deep</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.760" end="00:23:32.760" style="s2">neural nets for text analysis with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:35.340" style="s2">more symbolic approach to extracting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.760" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">meaning from text so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.340" end="00:23:40.289" style="s2">this sort of neural symbolic approach to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">AI is gonna be very big three or four</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.289" end="00:23:44.070" style="s2">years from now because deep neural Nets</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">in their current form we&#39;re gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.070" end="00:23:48.500" style="s2">out of steam I mean there&#39;s still more</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:51.570" style="s2">steam left because you know real-time</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.500" end="00:23:54.450" style="s2">analysis of videos and videos with audio</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.570" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">on your mobile phones chip that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.450" end="00:23:59.070" style="s2">yet rolled out commercially right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">there&#39;s more steps to be followed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.070" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">kind of straightforwardly by just</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:05.340" style="s2">incrementally improving and scaling up</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:08.070" style="s2">current deep neural nets but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.340" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">know once enough sensory data processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.070" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">has been milked using these deep neural</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">nets we&#39;re gonna hit a bunch of problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">that need more abstraction and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">guessing that tweaking deep neural nets</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">to do abstraction is not gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:24.510" style="s2">step forward now there may be many paths</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:27.659" style="s2">forward you can perhaps take a multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.510" end="00:24:29.640" style="s2">there on that architecture where some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.659" end="00:24:31.380" style="s2">the neural nets have a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.640" end="00:24:34.500" style="s2">architecture than the current</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.380" end="00:24:35.820" style="s2">hierarchical deep neural networks I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.500" end="00:24:37.289" style="s2">Google went a little bit in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.820" end="00:24:39.029" style="s2">direction with differential neural</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.289" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">computers and there&#39;s another papers</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.029" end="00:24:43.799" style="s2">like that but I&#39;m guessing that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">interfacing and synergizing logic</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.799" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">systems with neural nets it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">much less obscure thing in a few years</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:52.500" style="s2">and what we&#39;re already seeing more and</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:05.500" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to see a convergence of</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:51.880" style="s2">seems to be real language understanding</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.880" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">know you guys have done some work on</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.770" end="00:26:58.540" style="s2">that could you talk about your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:27:00.940" style="s2">on language understanding and where your</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.260" end="00:27:07.450" style="s2">be I think language understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.420" end="00:27:09.880" style="s2">quite critical to the AGI project I</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.450" end="00:27:12.190" style="s2">would say probably the most critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.880" end="00:27:14.650" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re working on now toward</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.190" end="00:27:17.500" style="s2">AGI is meta-reasoning reasoning about</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.650" end="00:27:19.390" style="s2">reasoning but we can come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.500" end="00:27:22.380" style="s2">language understanding is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.390" end="00:27:23.910" style="s2">easier to understand and we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.380" end="00:27:25.830" style="s2">been working on likely to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.130" end="00:27:37.530" style="s2">for syntax parsing I mean we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.620" end="00:27:40.260" style="s2">on using a combination of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.530" end="00:27:42.120" style="s2">pattern recognition and deep neural nets</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.929" end="00:28:15.860" style="s2">matter of learning mappings from parses</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.289" end="00:28:19.980" style="s2">of sentences syntax parts of sentences</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">sentences so I mean semantics is a big</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:33.150" style="s2">sentence may involve no memories and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.020" end="00:28:35.159" style="s2">episodic memory images that are evoked</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.159" end="00:28:41.000" style="s2">believe that I got key and perhaps core</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.010" end="00:28:44.429" style="s2">aspect of the semantics of a sentence is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.000" end="00:28:45.900" style="s2">in essence a logic expression or</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.900" end="00:28:51.059" style="s2">logic expression so you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.390" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">semantic interpretation as mapping a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.059" end="00:28:57.870" style="s2">syntax parts into a logic expression</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:00.120" style="s2">plus a bunch of other things like images</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">episodic memories sounds and so on that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.120" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of linked from or</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:06.330" style="s2">ornamented on this logic expression so</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:08.909" style="s2">how do you learn the mapping of syntax</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.330" end="00:29:11.370" style="s2">parses into logic expressions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.909" end="00:29:13.890" style="s2">sort of part 2 of a language</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.370" end="00:29:15.809" style="s2">understanding problem in part 3 that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.890" end="00:29:18.650" style="s2">being pragmatics how do you map the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.809" end="00:29:21.330" style="s2">semantics into the overall broader</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.650" end="00:29:24.210" style="s2">context which i think is well treated as</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.330" end="00:29:26.340" style="s2">a problem of Association learning and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.210" end="00:29:29.190" style="s2">reasoning in OpenCog we really deal with</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.340" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">the syntax learning tasks</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.250" end="00:29:52.460" style="s2">more on syntax learning recently and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.030" end="00:29:55.250" style="s2">focusing on unsupervised language</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.460" end="00:29:57.049" style="s2">acquisition where we&#39;re trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.250" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">system that automatically learns the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.049" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">dependency grammar which can then be fed</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:04.910" style="s2">into the link parser which is a well</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:07.690" style="s2">known grammar parser out of Carnegie</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.610" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">mean it gets better and better each</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.169" end="00:30:16.100" style="s2">month we&#39;re able to parse more more</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.340" style="s2">sentences with greater and greater</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.340" end="00:30:23.870" style="s2">supervised learning based grammar</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:26.990" style="s2">parsers that you feed a corpus of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.870" end="00:30:28.460" style="s2">diagram sentences into but one</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.990" end="00:30:31.400" style="s2">interesting thing we&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.460" end="00:30:34.700" style="s2">with is if you start with just a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.400" end="00:30:37.010" style="s2">bit of supervised data not even parse</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.700" end="00:30:39.740" style="s2">sentences but start with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.010" end="00:30:42.980" style="s2">chunk of parsing in tracing like like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.740" end="00:30:45.500" style="s2">mapping of linked collections of words</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.980" end="00:30:48.740" style="s2">in a sentence into semantic relations</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.500" end="00:30:50.840" style="s2">not a very small part of your corpus so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.740" end="00:30:54.110" style="s2">if you start with just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.840" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">partial parse information and then use</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.110" end="00:30:58.280" style="s2">that to seed your unsupervised learning</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">you can get much more accurate results</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.280" end="00:31:01.640" style="s2">and I think this is interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:04.669" style="s2">what well I think unsupervised learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.640" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">is a great paradigm I also think we</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.669" end="00:31:10.490" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be total purists about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">I mean starting with like whole complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.490" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">parse sentences like in the pantry bank</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:17.390" style="s2">parse sentence corpus or something feels</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:20.200" style="s2">wrong to me but if you can start with</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.390" end="00:31:23.480" style="s2">like simpler semantics or syntactic</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.200" end="00:31:25.100" style="s2">information about you know ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.480" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">sentences or something a very small</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.100" end="00:31:28.940" style="s2">percent of the senses you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s okay rather than a pure</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.940" end="00:31:35.330" style="s2">unsupervised approach and that brings us</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:36.190" style="s2">into how you learn semantics because one</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.330" end="00:31:39.250" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.190" end="00:31:42.429" style="s2">cymatics is to look at say captioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.250" end="00:31:44.980" style="s2">images as a desert source because if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.429" end="00:31:46.990" style="s2">have images with captions I mean then</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.980" end="00:31:48.580" style="s2">you can use under on that and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.990" end="00:31:50.470" style="s2">all that connected the OpenCog say to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.580" end="00:31:53.590" style="s2">recognize the relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.470" end="00:31:55.899" style="s2">what&#39;s in the images and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.590" end="00:31:57.610" style="s2">correlate that with the syntax parses of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.899" end="00:32:00.190" style="s2">the sentences that are captions to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.610" end="00:32:02.649" style="s2">images then you&#39;re connecting what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.190" end="00:32:05.830" style="s2">sentence is about which is the image</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.649" end="00:32:08.139" style="s2">with the syntax structure in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.830" end="00:32:09.639" style="s2">image right so suppose you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.139" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">ten thousand or a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.639" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">captioned images and ten million</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:18.279" style="s2">sentences without captions then you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:19.960" style="s2">if you take the supervised data that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.279" end="00:32:21.669" style="s2">comes from the captured images which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.960" end="00:32:24.970" style="s2">supervised in the sense that you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.669" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">some semantics there in the images which</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:31.330" style="s2">then the unsupervised data of all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.690" end="00:32:33.009" style="s2">other senses in your corpus now if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.330" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">can make something work from that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.009" end="00:32:37.299" style="s2">also very interesting perhaps just as</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:39.340" style="s2">interesting as pure unsupervised grammar</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.299" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">learning right so we&#39;re we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.340" end="00:32:43.539" style="s2">with both of these approaches pure</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">unsupervised grammar reduction and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.539" end="00:32:48.639" style="s2">grammar induction where you have a small</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:51.309" style="s2">percent of your sentence corpus which</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.639" end="00:32:53.320" style="s2">has links into something non non</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.309" end="00:32:55.000" style="s2">grammatical and that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.320" end="00:32:56.980" style="s2">sort of how people do it right we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.000" end="00:32:59.950" style="s2">some senses that we had a non linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.980" end="00:33:01.750" style="s2">corrala - and then a lot of senses that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.950" end="00:33:04.120" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a non linguistic koyla -</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:06.190" style="s2">but we have to figure it out and do the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.120" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">semantic interpretation yeah I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:10.299" style="s2">say that we have an existence proof that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.370" style="s2">in the one existence proof we have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.299" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">language learning is a mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.370" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">supervised and unsupervised right how a</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">child learns you know they are babbling</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:21.789" style="s2">away and random initially and then they</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:24.940" style="s2">get feedback mom smiles when you say ba</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.789" end="00:33:26.950" style="s2">for instance right and as people have</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.940" end="00:33:28.509" style="s2">done more and more research there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.950" end="00:33:31.019" style="s2">clearly a lot of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.509" end="00:33:34.779" style="s2">it&#39;s an existence proof or cross modal</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.019" end="00:33:38.110" style="s2">learning with very crude reinforcement</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.779" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">based supervision which is different</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.110" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">than either unsupervised corpus learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">or supervised learning in the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:51.270" style="s2">fed sends parses of the sentences right</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.330" end="00:33:53.820" style="s2">how kids learn is different than either</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.270" end="00:33:57.720" style="s2">of those and I mean this really gets</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.820" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">into the AGI preschool idea that I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.720" end="00:34:03.930" style="s2">proposed a long time ago I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:07.800" style="s2">gets into the idea of no little kids are</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.930" end="00:34:10.770" style="s2">a they&#39;re just observing a huge</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">that achieve those goals and their</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.300" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2">learned something from supervised</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:50.280" style="s2">grammar induction too but I think we may</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.929" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">have learned what there is to be learned</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.280" end="00:34:54.330" style="s2">from that there&#39;s a lot to be learned</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:57.000" style="s2">from studying captioned images there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.650" end="00:35:06.090" style="s2">learning paradigms are a bit different</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.750" end="00:35:09.030" style="s2">than what you know the human kids are</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.090" end="00:35:11.430" style="s2">doing and we may need to do something</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.030" end="00:35:13.500" style="s2">more like where the human baby is doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.430" end="00:35:16.260" style="s2">or it may be that by piecing together</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.500" end="00:35:18.900" style="s2">these different more computing friendly</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.260" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">learning paradigms we&#39;re gonna solve the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.900" end="00:35:22.350" style="s2">problem right I mean we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:26.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interesting experiments</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.350" end="00:35:27.990" style="s2">to do I think for semantics in the end</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.040" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">you need to apply learning between</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.990" end="00:35:33.840" style="s2">grammar and sentences that are parsed</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:36.120" style="s2">using a grammar and a non linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.840" end="00:35:38.310" style="s2">domain and you know that a non</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.120" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">linguistic domain could be logic</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.310" end="00:35:43.290" style="s2">expressions gotten from somewhere like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:45.930" style="s2">parallel corpus of English and large</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.290" end="00:35:48.570" style="s2">bond which is a language speak about by</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.930" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">people with as syntax is directly</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.570" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">personal in the predicate logic</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:56.490" style="s2">or it could come from correlation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:59.430" style="s2">English census and images are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.490" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">captured image corpus or movies with</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:06.510" style="s2">it could come from a robot that hears</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.510" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to act in but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.460" end="00:36:13.800" style="s2">clearly although much semantics that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:15.960" style="s2">humans use is very abstract like if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.800" end="00:36:18.570" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about quantum mechanics or</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.960" end="00:36:21.000" style="s2">continental philosophy you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.570" end="00:36:23.910" style="s2">basis for the abstract semantics that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.000" end="00:36:26.310" style="s2">learn is earlier stage smacks it comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.910" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">from correlating linguistic productions</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.310" end="00:36:31.890" style="s2">with sensory non linguistic environments</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:35.190" style="s2">so I think you know pattern mining</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.890" end="00:36:37.619" style="s2">across linguistic productions and non</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.190" end="00:36:40.109" style="s2">linguistic sensory environments or</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.619" end="00:36:42.109" style="s2">situations this is how you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.109" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">to semantics and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.109" end="00:36:45.960" style="s2">pragmatics is the same way but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:47.730" style="s2">you&#39;re there you&#39;re correlating</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.960" end="00:36:50.579" style="s2">linguistic productions with whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.730" end="00:36:53.369" style="s2">episodes and then you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.579" end="00:36:56.280" style="s2">perception and goal based processing</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.369" end="00:36:58.319" style="s2">across the episodes yeah Ben let me jump</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.280" end="00:37:00.210" style="s2">off from that into something that just</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.319" end="00:37:03.780" style="s2">come across my desk recently which was</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.210" end="00:37:06.390" style="s2">paper by Jeff Klum he had three pillars</p>

<p begin="00:37:06.390" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">intelligence the first two I thought</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">was quite interesting and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.869" end="00:37:17.819" style="s2">relevant to this language understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:20.099" style="s2">problem which is to develop technologies</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.099" end="00:37:26.250" style="s2">could we for instance somehow miracle</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.640" end="00:37:28.740" style="s2">occurs be able to develop language</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.250" end="00:37:32.490" style="s2">learning environments that had embedded</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.740" end="00:37:34.230" style="s2">within them pragmatics and semantics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.490" end="00:37:37.619" style="s2">were supported by natural language</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.230" end="00:37:39.869" style="s2">syntax and we&#39;re able to generate cases</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.619" end="00:37:42.210" style="s2">for these language learning systems to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.869" end="00:37:45.470" style="s2">use to use multi-level learning the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.210" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">humans seem to as you point out either</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.470" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">classic unsupervised nor classic</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:54.599" style="s2">computational linguistics provides that</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.599" end="00:37:58.380" style="s2">which is what we know that children do</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.369" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">does this seem to you a fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.380" end="00:38:01.510" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.500" end="00:38:03.880" style="s2">perhaps for language learning I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.510" end="00:38:06.310" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I mean I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.880" end="00:38:08.500" style="s2">say at a crude level we were generating</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.310" end="00:38:10.450" style="s2">learning environments I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.500" end="00:38:12.130" style="s2">eight or seven or eight years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.450" end="00:38:14.020" style="s2">I&#39;m sure other people were well before</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.130" end="00:38:17.770" style="s2">me right I mean because that anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.020" end="00:38:19.420" style="s2">has tried to do AGI oriented or transfer</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.770" end="00:38:21.610" style="s2">learning oriented learning in the video</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.420" end="00:38:23.620" style="s2">game world usually they don&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.610" end="00:38:25.720" style="s2">of game world authors on their team so</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.620" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">they end up writing scripts to generate</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.720" end="00:38:30.490" style="s2">stuff and then in the game world from</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:33.250" style="s2">some probability distribution so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.490" end="00:38:35.140" style="s2">that that practice is not remotely new</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.250" end="00:38:38.920" style="s2">but that paper that you&#39;re referencing</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.140" end="00:38:41.580" style="s2">sort of highlighted it as a key portion</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.920" end="00:38:44.740" style="s2">of an AGI approach with with greater</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.580" end="00:38:47.050" style="s2">greater oomph and and rigor than had</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.050" end="00:38:53.290" style="s2">potentially valuable I mean I think I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.130" end="00:39:08.350" style="s2">certainly interesting to do I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.640" end="00:39:10.930" style="s2">world that we live in you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.350" end="00:39:12.730" style="s2">weird and and diverse collection of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.930" end="00:39:14.620" style="s2">patterns in it that we&#39;re just not at</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.730" end="00:39:17.170" style="s2">in-game world yeah I&#39;d like to echo</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.620" end="00:39:19.420" style="s2">tonight you know I baked cookies with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.170" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">wife from my 16 month old baby we make</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.420" end="00:39:23.290" style="s2">one batch of peanut butter cookies and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.510" style="s2">one batch of cookies with some other</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.290" end="00:39:28.090" style="s2">type of nut butter one of them was much</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.510" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">thicker than the other before we cooked</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.090" end="00:39:32.020" style="s2">it and that result in the different</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.970" style="s2">consistency after we cooked it right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:36.460" style="s2">I mean the baby is learning from that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.970" end="00:39:38.410" style="s2">and there&#39;s endless things like that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.460" end="00:39:40.360" style="s2">our everyday life like different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.410" end="00:39:42.550" style="s2">of mud that you walked through the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.360" end="00:39:44.770" style="s2">the beach near my house looked at high</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.550" end="00:39:46.750" style="s2">versus low tide and how that affects the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.770" end="00:39:49.480" style="s2">behavior of the animals and plants there</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.750" end="00:39:51.700" style="s2">you know each example like this seems</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.480" end="00:39:52.780" style="s2">like a kind of irrelevant thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.700" end="00:39:55.030" style="s2">point is we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.780" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">with an endless abundance of these weird</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.030" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">little distinctions which however are</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.300" end="00:40:02.440" style="s2">carefully patterned on many different</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:05.580" style="s2">levels right and we&#39;re just not getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.440" end="00:40:07.990" style="s2">that in game worlds now these are</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.580" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">multi-sensory it&#39;d be hard to get them</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.990" end="00:40:13.570" style="s2">from videos unless you had a heck of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:17.020" style="s2">lot of videos and many different scales</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.570" end="00:40:18.970" style="s2">and space and time so I sort of I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.020" end="00:40:21.670" style="s2">if the best attempts we had to do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.970" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">in a game world now would still be to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.670" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">sort of rigid and limited in their</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:29.890" style="s2">variety to drive the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:31.600" style="s2">abundance of examples that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.890" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">in their minds from what should we draw</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.600" end="00:40:37.060" style="s2">analogies to do our abductive inference</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:41.410" style="s2">that drives our are transfer learning so</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.060" end="00:40:43.870" style="s2">as as a concept it&#39;s great I&#39;m not yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.410" end="00:40:46.330" style="s2">convinced that we have the models needed</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.870" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">to generate diverse enough environments</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.330" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">to really do a GI now whether of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:54.550" style="s2">generating game worlds with diverse</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:56.290" style="s2">environments is cool for prototyping and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.550" end="00:40:58.630" style="s2">experimenting and that&#39;s been done by a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.290" end="00:41:01.210" style="s2">lot of people over over a long long</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.630" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">period of time but if we broaden the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.210" end="00:41:06.040" style="s2">idea a bit I mean I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:08.230" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to use learning to learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.040" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">more training examples to train your AI</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.230" end="00:41:12.940" style="s2">and then the smarter AI and then use</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:16.360" style="s2">learning to learn more training examples</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.940" end="00:41:18.280" style="s2">and create more training examples that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.360" end="00:41:20.350" style="s2">interesting I mean I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.280" end="00:41:22.900" style="s2">about that in a mathematical theorem</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.350" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">proving context where you know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.900" end="00:41:28.990" style="s2">issue you have there is the number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:32.080" style="s2">theorems that human mathematicians have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.990" end="00:41:33.730" style="s2">created in the history of math is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.080" end="00:41:35.710" style="s2">that large when you compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:37.210" style="s2">requirement of you know deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.710" end="00:41:39.340" style="s2">algorithms and other machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.210" end="00:41:41.470" style="s2">algorithm selling we don&#39;t have as many</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.340" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">theorems as we do sentences or images</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.470" end="00:41:44.860" style="s2">right but yeah the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.270" end="00:41:47.710" style="s2">theorems is probably greater than that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.860" end="00:41:49.780" style="s2">of senses or images so on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.710" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">just generating a bunch of random truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.780" end="00:41:56.470" style="s2">theorems is not useful because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:57.980" style="s2">boring right so the idea there is if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.470" end="00:42:00.380" style="s2">had a rule to identify</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.980" end="00:42:02.840" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting theorem then you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.380" end="00:42:05.690" style="s2">generate trillions of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.840" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">theorems have your theorem prover try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.690" end="00:42:10.220" style="s2">prove them it would fail a lot but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:12.680" style="s2">you could prove billions of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.220" end="00:42:15.100" style="s2">theorems then the proofs of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.680" end="00:42:18.320" style="s2">billions of interesting theorems are</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.100" end="00:42:20.359" style="s2">training data for a machine learning to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.320" end="00:42:22.670" style="s2">learn how to do proofs right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.359" end="00:42:25.250" style="s2">a similarity there to the gameworld idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.670" end="00:42:27.950" style="s2">right you&#39;re wanting to you know study</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.250" end="00:42:31.550" style="s2">what you have to generate a new training</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.950" end="00:42:34.340" style="s2">data use that new training data to train</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.550" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">a eyes which then gets smarter and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.340" end="00:42:39.530" style="s2">can use to to generate even better</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:41.690" style="s2">training data and lather rinse repeat so</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.530" end="00:42:43.609" style="s2">I&#39;m I think that idea can be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.690" end="00:42:46.430" style="s2">in game worlds it could be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.609" end="00:42:48.859" style="s2">and fair improving and in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.430" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">places it&#39;s a question of whether you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.859" end="00:42:53.690" style="s2">have enough like requisite variety in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:55.550" style="s2">your available data to seed that initial</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.690" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">stage of automated environment</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">generation interesting all right the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:04.340" style="s2">next I think an area well worth people</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:05.780" style="s2">studying up and passing includes paper</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.340" end="00:43:08.030" style="s2">around trying to get people interested</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.780" end="00:43:09.800" style="s2">in it sounds like you agree there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.030" end="00:43:13.130" style="s2">least some merit to it let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.800" end="00:43:14.810" style="s2">one another item closely related which</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.130" end="00:43:17.480" style="s2">you know at some level dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.810" end="00:43:20.180" style="s2">robotics is a pain in the ass right</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.480" end="00:43:22.670" style="s2">stuff breaks you know that fall over</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.180" end="00:43:25.730" style="s2">they have to deal with the holes of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.670" end="00:43:27.850" style="s2">ground etc however when working with</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.730" end="00:43:30.790" style="s2">robotics you get an amazingly detailed</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.850" end="00:43:33.050" style="s2">simulation for free ie the universe</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.790" end="00:43:35.030" style="s2">could you talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.050" end="00:43:36.890" style="s2">intersection between AG AI and robotics</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.030" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">and what you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.890" end="00:43:42.290" style="s2">robotics Springs or doesn&#39;t bring or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:44.119" style="s2">mixed bag of things and brands I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.290" end="00:43:45.590" style="s2">have to add that programming is also a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.119" end="00:43:47.810" style="s2">pain in the ass I mean we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.590" end="00:43:49.160" style="s2">choosing between pick your poison right</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.810" end="00:43:49.670" style="s2">none of these things are not annoying</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.160" end="00:43:52.069" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.670" end="00:43:54.170" style="s2">you really dig into the I mean writing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.069" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">simple Python script is one thing but</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.170" end="00:43:58.490" style="s2">building OpenCog is not always that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:01.309" style="s2">simple or entertaining either there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.490" end="00:44:03.410" style="s2">lot of kinds of pain in the ass and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.309" end="00:44:04.010" style="s2">is true the closer you get to the real</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.410" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.010" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">maybe that maybe the more painful things</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:11.030" style="s2">become but I mean dealing with huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:13.220" style="s2">image corpuses and video corpuses is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.030" end="00:44:15.619" style="s2">also highly there&#39;s a lot about her</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.220" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">there too right so anyone who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.619" end="00:44:20.210" style="s2">work on the AGI in any aspect it&#39;s gotta</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:21.710" style="s2">have a very high pain tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.210" end="00:44:24.130" style="s2">otherwise they&#39;ll do something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.710" end="00:44:26.930" style="s2">gives more immediate gratification and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.130" end="00:44:29.180" style="s2">pays you more money quicker right but</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.930" end="00:44:32.089" style="s2">robotics I mean the main issue isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.180" end="00:44:34.490" style="s2">that tapering the robots is a pain the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.089" end="00:44:36.500" style="s2">issue is that the current robots don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.490" end="00:44:38.690" style="s2">so easily do what you want them to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.500" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">for AG I like what you want is a robot</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.940" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">Henson robotics</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:32.569" style="s2">with the you know the arm I hand</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.329" end="00:45:34.819" style="s2">coordination of I come and the fingertip</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.569" end="00:45:36.680" style="s2">sensitivity of sin touch if you put</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.819" end="00:45:38.809" style="s2">together all the robot bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.680" end="00:45:40.790" style="s2">that exist now in various robotics</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.809" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">projects around the world you would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.790" end="00:45:45.470" style="s2">that artificial toddler but no one seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:47.089" style="s2">to be funded to do that so we have all</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.470" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">the pieces now but no one has put</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.089" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">together that toddler robot for AGI yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.089" style="s2">and to do so would be expensive right</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:57.890" style="s2">and to do it cheaply it&#39;s also probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.089" end="00:45:59.060" style="s2">possible but it involves a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.890" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">engineering our</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.060" end="00:46:03.710" style="s2">d which is gonna take years to do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:05.180" style="s2">expensively easy and it cost you at</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.710" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">least hundreds of thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.180" end="00:46:10.340" style="s2">for the first toddler and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s really a pain is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.340" end="00:46:15.140" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with one or another robot</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.590" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2">that&#39;s very limited in what it can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.140" end="00:46:21.080" style="s2">either in you know manipulation or</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:24.320" style="s2">mobility or perception or battery life</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.080" end="00:46:27.290" style="s2">or something right and that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.320" end="00:46:29.420" style="s2">ironic because in theory the robot</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.290" end="00:46:32.180" style="s2">should be much more flexible than AI in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.420" end="00:46:34.460" style="s2">a virtual world and practice given the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.180" end="00:46:36.620" style="s2">limitations of each robot if still</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.460" end="00:46:39.470" style="s2">limited what you can do with each robot</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.620" end="00:46:42.080" style="s2">but I think you know this is like years</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.470" end="00:46:43.910" style="s2">not decades away from being resolves</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.080" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly a matter of integrating</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.910" end="00:46:48.820" style="s2">components that exist now and bring down</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:51.800" style="s2">the costs through scaling up</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.820" end="00:46:54.020" style="s2">manufacturing so that&#39;s I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.800" end="00:46:55.970" style="s2">within three to eight years let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.020" end="00:46:59.000" style="s2">robots are gonna be a really useful tool</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.970" end="00:47:02.060" style="s2">for AGI although they&#39;re that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.000" end="00:47:04.040" style="s2">very weakly true right now of course in</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.060" end="00:47:06.590" style="s2">principle for AGI you don&#39;t need a robot</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.040" end="00:47:08.330" style="s2">right I mean in principle you could get</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.590" end="00:47:09.950" style="s2">a superhuman Superman living on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.330" end="00:47:13.160" style="s2">internet there&#39;s a loads of sensors and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.950" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">actuators attached there but everyone a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.160" end="00:47:19.610" style="s2">human-like mind for it to have roughly</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:22.100" style="s2">human-like body it&#39;s gonna be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.610" end="00:47:24.740" style="s2">valuable because so many aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.100" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">human mind I mean they&#39;re attuned to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.740" end="00:47:30.620" style="s2">having a human-like body that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:33.890" style="s2">are that that&#39;s simple things relatively</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.620" end="00:47:36.520" style="s2">simple things like how we do I hand</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.890" end="00:47:39.320" style="s2">coordination by combining movement and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.520" end="00:47:42.290" style="s2">perception and lower-level cognition but</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.320" end="00:47:45.110" style="s2">also you know little things like the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.290" end="00:47:48.230" style="s2">narrative self and the the quasi</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.110" end="00:47:50.690" style="s2">illusion of free will and the relation</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.230" end="00:47:52.840" style="s2">between self another like all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.690" end="00:47:55.940" style="s2">things have to do with being agents</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.840" end="00:47:58.940" style="s2">controlling a body that feels pain and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.940" end="00:48:00.590" style="s2">has an inside and an outside and so then</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.940" end="00:48:02.690" style="s2">I mean you know when when you eat and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.590" end="00:48:05.120" style="s2">then you or you put something in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.690" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">your mouth squish it and spit it out all</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.120" end="00:48:09.110" style="s2">these things teach you something about</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:11.750" style="s2">the relation in yourself and in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.110" end="00:48:12.390" style="s2">world and persistence of objects and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.750" end="00:48:14.760" style="s2">get all those</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.390" end="00:48:17.250" style="s2">lessons in different way if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.760" end="00:48:19.170" style="s2">distributed supermind use mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.250" end="00:48:21.420" style="s2">or the internet but how much you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.170" end="00:48:24.150" style="s2">understand human values culture and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.420" end="00:48:26.339" style="s2">psychology that way I don&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.150" end="00:48:28.049" style="s2">so there&#39;s one question which is how</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.339" end="00:48:30.630" style="s2">important is embodiment for getting a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.049" end="00:48:32.130" style="s2">really smart AGI the other question is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.630" end="00:48:35.279" style="s2">how important is embodiment for in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.130" end="00:48:37.319" style="s2">AGI that understands what humans are and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.279" end="00:48:39.390" style="s2">empathizes with humans to a significant</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.319" end="00:48:41.970" style="s2">extent that&#39;s interesting I had not</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.390" end="00:48:44.220" style="s2">thought of that particular additional</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.970" end="00:48:46.710" style="s2">benefit from doing the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.220" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">cognition even if it was wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.710" end="00:48:51.539" style="s2">necessary to get the AGI it might make</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:54.299" style="s2">an AGI that&#39;s much more relatable to us</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.539" end="00:48:56.519" style="s2">and us to them let&#39;s move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.299" end="00:48:59.940" style="s2">subject I want to talk about which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.519" end="00:49:02.760" style="s2">your singularity net project you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.940" end="00:49:05.609" style="s2">this is really interesting you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.760" end="00:49:08.609" style="s2">idea of building a very broad network</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.609" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">that anybody can build AG AI components</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.609" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">on they can work with each other etc</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:16.380" style="s2">want to give us a good detailed</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:19.619" style="s2">description of singularity net and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.380" end="00:49:22.460" style="s2">know what status is currently and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.619" end="00:49:26.190" style="s2">you see going forward absolutely some</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.460" end="00:49:29.490" style="s2">singularity net you know it manifests</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.190" end="00:49:31.349" style="s2">some ideas I&#39;ve had for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.490" end="00:49:33.690" style="s2">then I was prototyping in the web mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.349" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">project in the late nineties because web</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.690" end="00:49:37.500" style="s2">mind was a you know a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">network of sort of autonomous agents</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.500" end="00:49:42.900" style="s2">cooperating together to manifest some</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:44.819" style="s2">emergent intelligence OpenCog to some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.900" end="00:49:46.650" style="s2">those ideas and tried to make him sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.819" end="00:49:49.619" style="s2">of more orderly and structured where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.650" end="00:49:52.289" style="s2">have a very carefully chosen set of AI</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.619" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">algorithms acting in a common knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.289" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">store much more carefully designed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:59.519" style="s2">configured to work closely entirely</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.349" style="s2">together than anything in web mind was</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.519" end="00:50:03.539" style="s2">singular net goes the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.349" end="00:50:06.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like let&#39;s take these different AI</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.539" end="00:50:08.490" style="s2">agents take a whole population of AI</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.119" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">agents each doing AI in their own way</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.490" end="00:50:12.089" style="s2">and they don&#39;t necessarily need to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">how each other are working internally</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.089" end="00:50:17.700" style="s2">they can interact via api&#39;s if they want</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:21.180" style="s2">to share state they can do that too but</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.700" end="00:50:23.430" style="s2">it&#39;s optional and then this society of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.180" end="00:50:25.660" style="s2">minds can have a payment system where</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.430" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">the AI is in that society page other</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.660" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">work or get paid by external agents for</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:33.160" style="s2">work to the society minds is an economy</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:36.460" style="s2">of mind and the economic aspect can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.160" end="00:50:38.200" style="s2">used to do no assignment of credit and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.460" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">assessment of value within the network</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.200" end="00:50:42.700" style="s2">which is an important aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:45.400" style="s2">cognition as well and then you know this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.700" end="00:50:47.799" style="s2">economy of minds is both it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.400" end="00:50:50.530" style="s2">approach to getting emergent AI where</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.799" end="00:50:52.780" style="s2">you have a more loosely coupled network</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.530" end="00:50:54.670" style="s2">of AI agents so you have an open cog but</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.780" end="00:50:56.589" style="s2">which can still manifest some emergent</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.670" end="00:50:59.410" style="s2">cognitive dynamics and it&#39;s collective</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.589" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">behaviors but then also you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.410" end="00:51:04.210" style="s2">potentially a viable commercial</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">ecosystem wherein anyone can put an AI</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.210" end="00:51:09.130" style="s2">agent into this network and the the you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:12.220" style="s2">know the AI agent give in charge</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.130" end="00:51:14.859" style="s2">external software processes for services</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.220" end="00:51:18.579" style="s2">and the eyes in the network can charge</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.859" end="00:51:20.670" style="s2">each other for services and then you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.579" end="00:51:23.170" style="s2">know this becomes a marketplace and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.670" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">however the infrastructure that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.170" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">chosen to implement this was based on</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:31.510" style="s2">you know the idea that this agent system</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:33.670" style="s2">is a self-organizing system without the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.510" end="00:51:36.010" style="s2">central controller just as I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.670" end="00:51:38.410" style="s2">brain doesn&#39;t have a central cell right</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.010" end="00:51:40.450" style="s2">I mean the brain has some aspects that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.410" end="00:51:42.760" style="s2">are in more of a controlling role than</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.450" end="00:51:45.220" style="s2">others but it&#39;s it&#39;s a massively</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.760" end="00:51:47.619" style="s2">parallel system where each part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.220" end="00:51:50.500" style="s2">brain is you know getting energy on its</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.619" end="00:51:53.049" style="s2">own and metabolizing and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.500" end="00:51:55.869" style="s2">guiding its own interactions so we use</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.869" end="00:52:01.720" style="s2">the singular infrastructure to enable a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.329" end="00:52:04.390" style="s2">bunch of AI agents to interact in a way</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.390" end="00:52:10.180" style="s2">you know heterogeneous Li controlled and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.059" end="00:52:13.299" style="s2">the AI agents of the network sort of in</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.299" end="00:52:17.349" style="s2">interact and then guide the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.670" end="00:52:20.589" style="s2">the overall network and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.349" end="00:52:23.049" style="s2">it&#39;s both a good way to architect you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.589" end="00:52:24.970" style="s2">know a self-organizing agent system</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.049" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">moving from general intelligence toward</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.970" end="00:52:30.730" style="s2">Adi and it&#39;s a very interesting way to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:33.490" style="s2">make a practical marketplace for a eyes</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.730" end="00:52:35.510" style="s2">which know potentially can be more</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.510" end="00:52:42.620" style="s2">kinds of applications it serves and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.380" end="00:52:45.560" style="s2">who gets profit from that I that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.620" end="00:52:47.240" style="s2">then the current mainstream AI ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.560" end="00:52:49.490" style="s2">which is highly centered on a few large</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.240" end="00:52:52.550" style="s2">corporations you have the visions</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.490" end="00:52:55.940" style="s2">obviously just astounding and that two</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.550" end="00:52:58.490" style="s2">fronts one this idea that anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.940" end="00:53:01.610" style="s2">play pieces can be added that could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.490" end="00:53:04.010" style="s2">explorations by a eyes to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.610" end="00:53:06.680" style="s2">other pieces of AI might be synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.010" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">to their own capabilities the last point</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.680" end="00:53:12.290" style="s2">you made that this is an ecosystem not</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">controlled by the big boys is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.290" end="00:53:17.180" style="s2">I found very attractive when I first</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:19.700" style="s2">learned about singularity that because</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.180" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">we are in a world where it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.700" end="00:53:24.530" style="s2">deep progress in AI is being more and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:28.190" style="s2">more concentrated into fewer and fewer</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.530" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">hands and singularity net looks like one</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.190" end="00:53:33.620" style="s2">of the relatively few counter trends to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:35.240" style="s2">that concentration could you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.620" end="00:53:36.980" style="s2">little bit more about that and why you</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.240" end="00:53:40.760" style="s2">think it might be important yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.980" end="00:53:43.820" style="s2">the importance of decentralized and open</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.760" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">approach to I is multifold right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.820" end="00:53:47.810" style="s2">important right now because it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">enable AI to do more good in the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.810" end="00:53:52.790" style="s2">then this is gonna be possible with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:54.890" style="s2">centralized hegemonic approach we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.790" end="00:53:56.930" style="s2">seen the industry now it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.890" end="00:53:59.660" style="s2">important if you think that know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.930" end="00:54:02.630" style="s2">current internet work of no ai&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.660" end="00:54:05.600" style="s2">going to evolve into tomorrow&#39;s emergent</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.630" end="00:54:07.880" style="s2">AGI because I mean if you look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.600" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">the current network of centralized AI is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.880" end="00:54:13.400" style="s2">doing I&#39;d like to summarize it as</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:16.220" style="s2">selling spying killing and gambling</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.400" end="00:54:18.920" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s advertising it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.220" end="00:54:21.140" style="s2">making surveillance systems it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.920" end="00:54:23.720" style="s2">controlling weapons systems and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.140" end="00:54:26.540" style="s2">doing finance financial prediction risk</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.720" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">management for large banks and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.540" end="00:54:30.530" style="s2">I mean this you know felling spying</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.930" style="s2">killing and gambling are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.530" end="00:54:34.310" style="s2">human condition we&#39;re not gonna stamp</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.930" end="00:54:36.830" style="s2">them out I don&#39;t know if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.310" end="00:54:38.900" style="s2">stamp them out but I don&#39;t want them to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.830" end="00:54:41.360" style="s2">be as large a percent of the high</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.900" end="00:54:43.930" style="s2">ecosystem as they are right now you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.360" end="00:54:46.750" style="s2">rather see more like educating</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.930" end="00:54:49.329" style="s2">diseases doing science helping old</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.750" end="00:54:51.670" style="s2">people creating art both because these</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.329" end="00:54:55.150" style="s2">are cool things step around more on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.670" end="00:54:58.299" style="s2">planet now and because if I know I eyes</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.150" end="00:54:59.740" style="s2">are gonna turn into AG eyes I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.299" end="00:55:03.400" style="s2">have the AG eyes doing these</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.740" end="00:55:06.819" style="s2">compassionate and aesthetically creative</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.400" end="00:55:10.299" style="s2">things then you know serving the goals</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.819" end="00:55:12.520" style="s2">of current corporations and large large</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.299" end="00:55:14.710" style="s2">government so I think yeah there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:16.839" style="s2">term importance and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.710" end="00:55:19.750" style="s2">little more speculative importance in</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.839" end="00:55:22.809" style="s2">terms of the your potential of current</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.750" end="00:55:26.650" style="s2">know I eyes in giving rise to tomorrow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.809" end="00:55:29.289" style="s2">AG eyes and you know if you look at how</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.650" end="00:55:32.140" style="s2">the current hegemonic situation has come</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.289" end="00:55:34.029" style="s2">about that&#39;s not really because of bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.140" end="00:55:36.670" style="s2">guys you know it&#39;s because of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.029" end="00:55:39.369" style="s2">self-organizing socio-economic dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.670" end="00:55:41.230" style="s2">I mean that the Google founder is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.369" end="00:55:43.210" style="s2">good people you know they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.230" end="00:55:45.819" style="s2">trying to make money like all business</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.210" end="00:55:47.829" style="s2">people are they&#39;re also genuinely trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.819" end="00:55:48.339" style="s2">to build AI that will do good for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.829" end="00:55:50.500" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.339" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">but I mean the way they&#39;re doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.500" end="00:55:54.670" style="s2">the way a public company has to do it as</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:56.260" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to do good for the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.670" end="00:55:58.329" style="s2">as a side effect of generating</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.260" end="00:56:00.490" style="s2">shareholder value and the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.329" end="00:56:01.779" style="s2">generating shareholder value is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.490" end="00:56:03.940" style="s2">the way they have to do it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.779" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">taking whatever works and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.940" end="00:56:07.690" style="s2">doubling down on it I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:10.119" style="s2">trying a lot of side projects to but in</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.690" end="00:56:13.270" style="s2">the end ads are what&#39;s making the money</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.119" end="00:56:15.640" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s their fiduciary duty to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.270" end="00:56:18.130" style="s2">using the best AI for that as much as</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.640" end="00:56:21.460" style="s2">makes sense and if you look in China</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.130" end="00:56:23.020" style="s2">I mean Xi Jinping is doing some things</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.460" end="00:56:24.910" style="s2">that don&#39;t agree with on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.020" end="00:56:27.279" style="s2">you know Chinese government has lift</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.910" end="00:56:29.230" style="s2">lifted way more people out of poverty</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.279" end="00:56:32.260" style="s2">over the last thirty years than every</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.230" end="00:56:33.910" style="s2">other part of the world combined and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.260" end="00:56:37.270" style="s2">think you know Chinese government is</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.910" end="00:56:39.670" style="s2">genuinely trying to advance the total</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.270" end="00:56:41.859" style="s2">utility of the Chinese population and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.670" end="00:56:44.950" style="s2">they see that AI is very helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.859" end="00:56:47.799" style="s2">this and you know they think building a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.950" end="00:56:50.170" style="s2">surveillance state is in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.799" end="00:56:52.750" style="s2">the you know the utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.170" end="00:56:55.450" style="s2">good of the Chinese population we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.750" end="00:56:56.289" style="s2">looking at psychopaths who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.450" end="00:56:58.180" style="s2">develop AI</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.289" end="00:56:59.980" style="s2">to build the Terminator or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.180" end="00:57:02.230" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at people developing AI in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.980" end="00:57:05.589" style="s2">the interest of generally beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.230" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">minded goals but there&#39;s these network</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.589" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">effects involved and that&#39;s both good</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:13.000" style="s2">and bad right I mean the network effects</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:14.890" style="s2">allow a smart AI to accumulate more and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.000" end="00:57:17.650" style="s2">more resources that can partly go to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.890" end="00:57:20.140" style="s2">building smarter and smarter AI but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.650" end="00:57:23.289" style="s2">network effects often mean that whoever</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.140" end="00:57:26.740" style="s2">you know succeeds first with neuro a</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.289" end="00:57:29.349" style="s2">eyes in particular tasks that lends</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.740" end="00:57:32.920" style="s2">himself to rapid deployment of neuro AI</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.349" end="00:57:34.990" style="s2">for useful ends whoever succeeds first</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.920" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">you can you accumulate the hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.990" end="00:57:41.650" style="s2">of money I love data to train the a eyes</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">a lot of processing power to feed the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.650" end="00:57:46.839" style="s2">eyes and there&#39;s a powerful network</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:49.390" style="s2">effect there and this is what Google has</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.839" end="00:57:50.980" style="s2">been benefiting from I mean the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.390" end="00:57:53.890" style="s2">government is benefiting from this</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.980" end="00:57:55.630" style="s2">Facebook use Microsoft is IBM for</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.890" end="00:57:58.089" style="s2">example isn&#39;t so much because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.630" end="00:57:59.740" style="s2">been deploying AI in markets in ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.089" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">that don&#39;t lead to these tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.740" end="00:58:03.789" style="s2">network effects and that&#39;s cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:06.490" style="s2">fall behind in spite of having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.789" end="00:58:09.309" style="s2">smart AI people and some AI technologies</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.490" end="00:58:11.019" style="s2">are very good at certain things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.309" end="00:58:14.769" style="s2">one of the cool things with singularity</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.019" end="00:58:17.410" style="s2">net is intrinsically at least the logic</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.769" end="00:58:19.480" style="s2">of singularity Nets economic model has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.410" end="00:58:22.450" style="s2">lot of network effects to it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.480" end="00:58:25.420" style="s2">double-sided platform like uber Airbnb</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.450" end="00:58:28.269" style="s2">or you know Amazon&#39;s neural net model</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.420" end="00:58:30.670" style="s2">marketplace it&#39;s a double-sided platform</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.269" end="00:58:32.829" style="s2">in the sense that one side is the supply</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.670" end="00:58:35.380" style="s2">of AI that developers for open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.829" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">network the other side is the demand</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.380" end="00:58:39.970" style="s2">which is product developers who want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:42.579" style="s2">use the eyes of the network to fuel</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.970" end="00:58:44.680" style="s2">their products and it at end users right</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.579" end="00:58:46.930" style="s2">and so that&#39;s something that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.680" end="00:58:49.119" style="s2">powerful if you can get off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.930" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">so if you get enough demand you can get</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.119" end="00:58:51.330" style="s2">more supply and the supply you can get</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:53.790" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.330" end="00:58:56.190" style="s2">does she have this going enough they can</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.790" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">take off really really fast so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.190" end="00:59:02.520" style="s2">the possibility to use the same network</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:04.950" style="s2">effect trick that Google Facebook you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.520" end="00:59:07.740" style="s2">know and then Tencent Baidu Holly Baba</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.950" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">and so on have used to get this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.740" end="00:59:13.260" style="s2">decentralized network of I eyes off the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:16.830" style="s2">ground and you know it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.260" end="00:59:18.660" style="s2">displace totally the big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.830" end="00:59:21.720" style="s2">to have a huge impact we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.660" end="00:59:24.090" style="s2">Linux as an example I mean Linux didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.720" end="00:59:26.370" style="s2">obsolete Apple and Microsoft they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.090" end="00:59:28.710" style="s2">still making money you know trillion</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.370" end="00:59:31.170" style="s2">dollar companies but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.710" end="00:59:33.960" style="s2">Linux it&#39;s a number one mobile operating</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.170" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">system its dominant in the server market</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.960" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">it&#39;s big in the open-source ethos behind</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:41.190" style="s2">it has been huge has been used available</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:43.170" style="s2">for the developing world for the maker</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.190" end="00:59:45.750" style="s2">and robotics community right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.170" end="00:59:48.780" style="s2">similarly if we can get a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.750" end="00:59:51.990" style="s2">a ID network to have a major role in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.780" end="00:59:54.930" style="s2">way that AI is utilized in the world I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.990" end="00:59:58.010" style="s2">mean then that&#39;s gonna be tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.930" end="01:00:00.300" style="s2">even if it doesn&#39;t obsolete the hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.010" end="01:00:02.190" style="s2">growing that network with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.300" end="01:00:05.220" style="s2">double-sided network effect is certainly</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.190" end="01:00:07.110" style="s2">a practical challenge right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.220" end="01:00:10.140" style="s2">what we&#39;re working on with a singularity</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.110" end="01:00:12.450" style="s2">that platform now one thing I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.140" end="01:00:15.360" style="s2">pick up on the singularity that model</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.450" end="01:00:18.600" style="s2">you described how you have a potential</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.360" end="01:00:21.060" style="s2">network effect around a two-sided market</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.600" end="01:00:22.980" style="s2">those are indeed very very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.060" end="01:00:24.330" style="s2">business models you know much of my</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.980" end="01:00:26.340" style="s2">business career was actually around</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.330" end="01:00:28.260" style="s2">trying to build two-sided markets and</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.340" end="01:00:30.540" style="s2">sometimes we were successful sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.260" end="01:00:33.090" style="s2">we weren&#39;t usually it meant</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.540" end="01:00:35.460" style="s2">investing in building one side of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.090" end="01:00:37.410" style="s2">market first could you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.460" end="01:00:39.690" style="s2">about your go-to-market strategy for</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.410" end="01:00:42.060" style="s2">singularity net and how you expect to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.690" end="01:00:44.040" style="s2">achieve a critical mass somewhere to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.060" end="01:00:46.500" style="s2">the two-sided market start the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.040" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of different strategies</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:52.020" style="s2">we&#39;re applying here but I would say if</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:54.779" style="s2">it&#39;s one side in the market first we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.020" end="01:00:57.779" style="s2">essentially focusing on building the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.779" end="01:01:01.229" style="s2">and cited the market first and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.779" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">training the supply internally initially</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.229" end="01:01:06.179" style="s2">because we have a bunch of AI developers</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:07.890" style="s2">on the singularity net foundation team</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.179" end="01:01:11.459" style="s2">or a larger the people I work with on</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.890" end="01:01:14.999" style="s2">previous projects and so we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.459" end="01:01:17.989" style="s2">build some AI ourselves to put in in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.999" end="01:01:21.150" style="s2">network and then where we are doing AI</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.989" end="01:01:24.299" style="s2">developer workshops and we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.150" end="01:01:26.579" style="s2">some requests for AI on the platform and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.299" end="01:01:29.309" style="s2">and say people with tokens to put new AI</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.579" end="01:01:32.729" style="s2">into the network so we&#39;re not totally</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.309" end="01:01:36.390" style="s2">neglecting the supply side but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.729" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">demand side is getting more of a big</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.390" end="01:01:41.880" style="s2">push in a couple forums so one of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.640" end="01:01:45.150" style="s2">forms is we&#39;re spinning off a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.880" end="01:01:47.189" style="s2">company called singularity studio which</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.150" end="01:01:49.890" style="s2">is a whole separate enterprise aimed at</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.189" end="01:01:52.169" style="s2">building commercial products into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.890" end="01:01:54.839" style="s2">enterprise on top of of the singularity</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.169" end="01:01:56.819" style="s2">net platform and initially we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.839" end="01:02:00.359" style="s2">building a product suite aimed at</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.819" end="01:02:02.489" style="s2">FinTech in the finance industry so say</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.359" end="01:02:04.439" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a risk management product</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.489" end="01:02:07.229" style="s2">which then you know it would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.439" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">subscribed to by a large financial firm</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.229" end="01:02:12.390" style="s2">to solve a problem and say hedging or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.079" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">credit risk assessment or something but</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.390" end="01:02:17.459" style="s2">then on the back end that product is</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:20.099" style="s2">getting its AI by making calls into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.459" end="01:02:23.189" style="s2">singularity net platform so if this</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.099" end="01:02:26.159" style="s2">business succeeds in creating and</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.189" end="01:02:28.409" style="s2">selling you know successful products</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.159" end="01:02:30.289" style="s2">initially to financial services and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.409" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">after that other vertical markets</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.289" end="01:02:36.119" style="s2">Internet of Things health tech and so on</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:38.999" style="s2">then you know each product that sold the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.119" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">licensing fees for each year a fraction</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.999" end="01:02:44.699" style="s2">that will be converted from fiat into a</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:47.459" style="s2">GI token and used to drive the Adi token</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.699" end="01:02:50.249" style="s2">based market in singularity net so</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.459" end="01:02:52.289" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing the singularity studio</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.249" end="01:02:54.929" style="s2">which we&#39;re currently pulling together</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.289" end="01:02:57.390" style="s2">and we have some enterprise customers</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.929" end="01:03:00.320" style="s2">already for that I mean a couple that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.390" end="01:03:02.390" style="s2">are publicly announced but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.320" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">bunch more big ones that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.390" end="01:03:07.030" style="s2">with they&#39;re going to be announced in</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:09.920" style="s2">the next few months we&#39;ve also launched</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.030" end="01:03:11.660" style="s2">accelerator called singularity net X lab</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:14.150" style="s2">where we&#39;re recruiting projects from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.660" end="01:03:17.270" style="s2">community that will build software</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.150" end="01:03:20.120" style="s2">products aimed at certain niches again</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.270" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">using AI in the singularity net and this</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.120" end="01:03:23.900" style="s2">again is focused on the demand for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:25.940" style="s2">network side because they&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.900" end="01:03:28.760" style="s2">products on top of singular net but they</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.940" end="01:03:30.890" style="s2">also help with supply cuz in most cases</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.760" end="01:03:33.980" style="s2">they I that we put in there is being</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.890" end="01:03:35.750" style="s2">augmented by AI that that this team puts</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.980" end="01:03:38.090" style="s2">in there also and then the projects in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.750" end="01:03:40.220" style="s2">the X lab incubator so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.090" end="01:03:43.400" style="s2">being you know we can give them some</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.220" end="01:03:45.140" style="s2">tokens help them get AI services on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.400" end="01:03:48.890" style="s2">network and we can help them with</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.140" end="01:03:51.560" style="s2">publicity using our PR engine and help</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.890" end="01:03:55.220" style="s2">them with with AI expertise where we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.560" end="01:03:57.830" style="s2">so these are both efforts kind of brute</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.220" end="01:04:01.420" style="s2">force the demand side we&#39;re also talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.830" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">to some investors scaling up this</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.420" end="01:04:07.460" style="s2">accelerator slash incubator effort where</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:11.180" style="s2">we&#39;d be able to put some more money into</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.460" end="01:04:13.340" style="s2">seeding projects leveraging the platform</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.180" end="01:04:15.170" style="s2">using some investment money raised</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.340" end="01:04:17.690" style="s2">specifically for that purpose so I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.170" end="01:04:20.120" style="s2">if if we get the singularity studio</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.690" end="01:04:22.490" style="s2">building enterprise products and getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.120" end="01:04:24.410" style="s2">some large enterprises using through</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.490" end="01:04:26.030" style="s2">these products a singularity net and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.410" end="01:04:29.150" style="s2">then we get some smaller entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.030" end="01:04:30.770" style="s2">products from the X lab accelerator then</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.150" end="01:04:32.930" style="s2">you know we&#39;re getting some serious</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.770" end="01:04:35.210" style="s2">utilization of the token and if through</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.930" end="01:04:37.970" style="s2">these efforts we get serious utilization</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.210" end="01:04:39.800" style="s2">of the ATI token and the AG ITER</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.970" end="01:04:41.720" style="s2">committed ecosystem you know all of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.800" end="01:04:43.580" style="s2">sudden we have a utility talking with</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.720" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">actual utility which is almost unheard</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.580" end="01:04:48.620" style="s2">of in the blockchain space right and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">this this is gonna attract a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.620" end="01:04:54.140" style="s2">attention in the blockchain community</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:56.630" style="s2">and hopefully in the AI community and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.140" end="01:04:59.240" style="s2">think this will then incent more people</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.630" end="01:05:01.820" style="s2">to put their AI into the platform we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.240" end="01:05:04.190" style="s2">get some usage from the developer</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.820" end="01:05:06.770" style="s2">workshops we&#39;re doing but in the end I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.190" end="01:05:09.500" style="s2">mean having demand for the platform was</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.770" end="01:05:11.390" style="s2">sort of it will give some extra appeal</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.500" end="01:05:12.170" style="s2">to developers because then it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.390" end="01:05:14.359" style="s2">but they&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.170" end="01:05:16.430" style="s2">ái out there in a really cool yo</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.359" end="01:05:18.530" style="s2">decentralized democratically governed</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.430" end="01:05:21.049" style="s2">platform there&#39;s an actual you know</p>

<p begin="01:05:38.270" end="01:05:43.910" style="s2">think we&#39;ll be able to seduce the supply</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.910" end="01:05:48.770" style="s2">visionary project which you know could</p>

<p begin="01:05:59.420" end="01:06:05.240" style="s2">interesting experiment worth trying</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.230" end="01:06:09.049" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to an another topic which</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.240" end="01:06:11.750" style="s2">is thinking about AI and AGI in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.049" end="01:06:15.500" style="s2">context of complex self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.750" end="01:06:18.049" style="s2">systems emergence chaos strange</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.500" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">attractors I know those are things</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.049" end="01:06:22.460" style="s2">you&#39;ve thought a lot about and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:26.270" style="s2">least a little about so take it away Ben</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.460" end="01:06:29.089" style="s2">yeah I think my focus on complex</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.270" end="01:06:31.369" style="s2">nonlinear dynamics and emergence is</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.089" end="01:06:33.470" style="s2">something that sets my line of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.369" end="01:06:36.290" style="s2">apart from the mainstream of the AI</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.470" end="01:06:38.599" style="s2">world now like I remember when Jeff</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.290" end="01:06:40.910" style="s2">Hopkins book on intelligence came out</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.599" end="01:06:43.040" style="s2">you know 15 years ago or something seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.910" end="01:06:46.130" style="s2">like forever but I mean that that book</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.040" end="01:06:48.349" style="s2">laid out the vision of no AI in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.130" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">hierarchical neural nets combining</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.349" end="01:06:52.819" style="s2">probabilistic reasoning with</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:54.230" style="s2">backpropagation I mean it was different</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.819" end="01:06:56.660" style="s2">than the deep neural Nets that are most</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.230" end="01:06:59.930" style="s2">successful now but conceptually it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.660" end="01:07:02.299" style="s2">along very very similar lines and when I</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.930" end="01:07:03.740" style="s2">reviewed that book I what I said is well</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.299" end="01:07:06.049" style="s2">this is interesting it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.740" end="01:07:07.880" style="s2">story but he&#39;s leaving out two key</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.049" end="01:07:09.619" style="s2">things he&#39;s leaving out evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.880" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">learning which we know is there in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.619" end="01:07:13.220" style="s2">brain in the sensory tlemen snarled</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:15.710" style="s2">Darwinism modeling the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.220" end="01:07:16.620" style="s2">developing system and he&#39;s leaving out</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.710" end="01:07:19.800" style="s2">no none</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.620" end="01:07:21.680" style="s2">vyx and emergence and strange attractors</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.800" end="01:07:23.880" style="s2">which you know are key and how the brain</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.680" end="01:07:25.950" style="s2">synchronizes and coordinates all its</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.880" end="01:07:28.770" style="s2">parts like these hierarchical networks</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.950" end="01:07:30.810" style="s2">doing learning and probabilistic pattern</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.770" end="01:07:32.700" style="s2">recognition are there but they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.810" end="01:07:36.530" style="s2">part of the story if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.700" end="01:07:38.670" style="s2">evolution and although poesis like self</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.530" end="01:07:40.500" style="s2">reconstruction and self construction</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.670" end="01:07:43.230" style="s2">based on linear dynamical attractors</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.500" end="01:07:45.870" style="s2">then you&#39;re really missing out a lot so</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.230" end="01:07:47.460" style="s2">in the early 90s when I was first</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.870" end="01:07:49.050" style="s2">thinking about how the mind works I</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.460" end="01:07:51.840" style="s2">wrote a book called the evolving mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.050" end="01:07:55.140" style="s2">where I argued there are sort of two key</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.840" end="01:07:57.210" style="s2">forces underlying intelligence systems I</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.140" end="01:07:59.070" style="s2">mean in philosophy terms that come down</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.210" end="01:08:01.860" style="s2">to being and becoming so we&#39;re back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.070" end="01:08:04.170" style="s2">Hegel right but in dynamics terms you</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.860" end="01:08:07.380" style="s2">can think of them as evolution and other</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.170" end="01:08:09.630" style="s2">places other voices being a term</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.380" end="01:08:12.270" style="s2">introduced by Maturana and Varela</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.630" end="01:08:14.820" style="s2">meaning like self creation self building</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.270" end="01:08:17.220" style="s2">which is is one particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.820" end="01:08:19.830" style="s2">complex non-linear dynamics that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.220" end="01:08:21.450" style="s2">seen in biology where a system is</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.830" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">involved with rebuilding and</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.450" end="01:08:27.720" style="s2">reconstructing itself I knew all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.480" end="01:08:31.380" style="s2">time and you know evolution creates the</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.720" end="01:08:34.620" style="s2">new from the old and other places keeps</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.380" end="01:08:36.930" style="s2">you know an organism a system intact in</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.620" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">a changing and mutating environment and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.930" end="01:08:41.400" style="s2">no nonlinear dynamics are key to both of</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:43.800" style="s2">these you could also think of this as</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.400" end="01:08:48.480" style="s2">evolution and ecology which are</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.800" end="01:08:50.130" style="s2">hand-in-hand in natural systems and even</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.480" end="01:08:52.770" style="s2">in the body where you have Eagleman</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.130" end="01:08:55.980" style="s2">neural Darwinism explaining brain data</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.770" end="01:08:58.410" style="s2">because evolution and you know gern is</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.980" end="01:09:01.140" style="s2">clonal selection theory explaining the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.410" end="01:09:04.170" style="s2">immune system as an evolving system</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.140" end="01:09:07.140" style="s2">along with you know the cell assembly</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.170" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">theory which had came up with to explain</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.140" end="01:09:11.490" style="s2">part of the have the brain works I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s basically an ecological theory</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.490" end="01:09:15.300" style="s2">and it&#39;s self-assembly is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.680" end="01:09:18.180" style="s2">autocratic system that keeps</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.300" end="01:09:20.310" style="s2">constructing and rebuilding itself in</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.180" end="01:09:23.760" style="s2">the immune system the network theory of</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.310" end="01:09:25.270" style="s2">Jonah is the the autocratic ecological</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.760" end="01:09:28.089" style="s2">aspect so I mean you if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.270" end="01:09:30.490" style="s2">leave out ecology slash other places in</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.089" end="01:09:32.170" style="s2">evolution and you have only hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.490" end="01:09:34.420" style="s2">pattern recognition you&#39;re leaving out a</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.170" end="01:09:36.819" style="s2">whole lot of what makes the even mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.420" end="01:09:40.299" style="s2">interesting like creativity is evolution</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.819" end="01:09:42.910" style="s2">and you know the self and the will and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.299" end="01:09:45.279" style="s2">all these and you know the conscious</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.910" end="01:09:47.049" style="s2">focus of attention which is binding</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.279" end="01:09:50.980" style="s2">together different parts of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.049" end="01:09:53.859" style="s2">into a perceived impractical unity this</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.980" end="01:09:55.690" style="s2">is all about strange attractors emerging</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.859" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">in the brain building you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.690" end="01:10:01.540" style="s2">autopoietic systems of activity pattern</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:03.460" style="s2">so you&#39;re leaving out all this like you</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.540" end="01:10:05.740" style="s2">do in modern deep learning systems well</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.460" end="01:10:07.870" style="s2">you&#39;re leaving out a of a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.740" end="01:10:09.850" style="s2">what makes the human minds interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.870" end="01:10:12.340" style="s2">granted that you&#39;re also capturing some</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.850" end="01:10:14.260" style="s2">some interesting parts and not much</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.340" end="01:10:17.140" style="s2">study your thought is going into these</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.260" end="01:10:19.360" style="s2">aspects in the mind right now and this</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.140" end="01:10:21.790" style="s2">is partly because of the business models</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.360" end="01:10:24.250" style="s2">of the large companies and governments</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.790" end="01:10:28.260" style="s2">are driving AI development because you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.250" end="01:10:31.810" style="s2">know creativity and ecological self</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.260" end="01:10:35.530" style="s2">reconstruction design that directly tied</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.810" end="01:10:37.320" style="s2">to easily measurable metrics that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.530" end="01:10:40.390" style="s2">can use to drive supervisor</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.320" end="01:10:43.120" style="s2">reinforcement learning so for a company</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.390" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s driven by their KPIs and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.120" end="01:10:48.550" style="s2">that company is naturally driven toward</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.520" end="01:10:52.210" style="s2">AI algorithms that are focused on</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.550" end="01:10:54.340" style="s2">maximizing some simply formulated reward</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.210" end="01:10:55.990" style="s2">function that&#39;s a little harder if</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.340" end="01:10:59.380" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about evolution to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.990" end="01:11:03.160" style="s2">new things or an ecological system whose</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.380" end="01:11:05.500" style="s2">goal is to maintain and grow itself the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.160" end="01:11:08.770" style="s2">money on money returned monster yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.500" end="01:11:10.690" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly so it ties into like</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.770" end="01:11:13.690" style="s2">the Neo Darwinist you have evolution its</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.690" end="01:11:15.400" style="s2">nature tooth and claw thinks nature make</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.690" end="01:11:17.800" style="s2">sure red in tooth and claw I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.400" end="01:11:19.900" style="s2">this view of evolution takes evolution</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.800" end="01:11:22.630" style="s2">is about you know maximizing some</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.900" end="01:11:24.460" style="s2">simplicity defined Fitness function when</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.630" end="01:11:26.260" style="s2">you look at evolution and ecology tied</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.460" end="01:11:27.610" style="s2">together in more of a nonlinear</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.260" end="01:11:28.869" style="s2">dynamical view</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.610" end="01:11:31.480" style="s2">you&#39;re getting beyond the simplicity</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.869" end="01:11:33.880" style="s2">defined Fitness function and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.480" end="01:11:36.010" style="s2">little more fuzzy to grapple with this</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.880" end="01:11:38.170" style="s2">goes back to you know something I</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.010" end="01:11:40.750" style="s2">observed a long time ago I pushed</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.170" end="01:11:42.880" style="s2">forward the idea of AGI but actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.750" end="01:11:44.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad term from a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.880" end="01:11:47.650" style="s2">philosophical you like no one knows what</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.920" end="01:11:49.719" style="s2">intelligence means humans aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.650" end="01:11:52.150" style="s2">all that general I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.719" end="01:11:53.920" style="s2">artificial is really because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.150" end="01:11:55.239" style="s2">part of nature so I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.920" end="01:11:57.670" style="s2">unofficial the general or the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.239" end="01:11:59.469" style="s2">intelligence really what I&#39;m after is</p>

<p begin="01:12:59.679" end="01:13:05.770" style="s2">is it a mind it may not be conscious in</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.130" end="01:13:08.230" style="s2">the sense we we think of ourselves as</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.770" end="01:13:09.610" style="s2">being conscious but it may have some</p>

<p begin="01:13:42.520" end="01:13:46.690" style="s2">more palatable to people with different</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.710" end="01:13:56.500" style="s2">form then you would view like a human</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.680" end="01:13:58.330" style="s2">like your mammal like consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.500" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">something that emerges from these sparks</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.330" end="01:14:02.260" style="s2">of proto consciousness you know when</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:20.650" style="s2">consciousness you know involved in a</p>

<p begin="01:14:27.160" end="01:14:31.990" style="s2">like hypothalamus or basal ganglia are</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.470" end="01:14:34.710" style="s2">our central controller in some broader</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.990" end="01:14:36.940" style="s2">sense maybe there is a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.710" end="01:14:39.730" style="s2">consciousness associated with it like</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.940" end="01:14:42.130" style="s2">there&#39;s some complex self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.730" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">pattern of proto conscious sparks there</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.130" end="01:14:47.470" style="s2">but it may not have the unity that</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.120" end="01:14:51.250" style="s2">characterizes human-like consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.470" end="01:14:52.900" style="s2">and so what in a way like this unity if</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.250" end="01:14:55.360" style="s2">our consciousness is there because our</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.900" end="01:14:57.610" style="s2">body is a unified system that has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.360" end="01:14:59.800" style="s2">control itself without dying right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.610" end="01:15:02.620" style="s2">so that gives us some unified goals of</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.800" end="01:15:03.780" style="s2">like food sex and survival if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.620" end="01:15:07.570" style="s2">different kind of complex</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.780" end="01:15:10.120" style="s2">self-organizing mindish system which can</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.570" end="01:15:12.030" style="s2">replace its parts that will and with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.120" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">different parts are pursuing various</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.030" end="01:15:18.180" style="s2">overlapping goals in a very dynamic way</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:20.800" style="s2">I mean whatever self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.180" end="01:15:23.560" style="s2">conglomeration of proto conscious sparks</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.800" end="01:15:25.660" style="s2">exists there may be much less unified</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.560" end="01:15:29.950" style="s2">that what&#39;s associated with the human</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.660" end="01:15:33.550" style="s2">mind brain and then is that better is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.950" end="01:15:36.370" style="s2">that worse I mean that comes out to your</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.550" end="01:15:40.120" style="s2">value system and yeah the fact that our</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.370" end="01:15:43.810" style="s2">value system values this unified variety</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.120" end="01:15:44.390" style="s2">of consciousness ish stuff more than</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.390" end="01:15:50.420" style="s2">more diffuse but perhaps more complex</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.780" end="01:15:52.550" style="s2">variety of consciousness ish being like</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.420" end="01:15:54.830" style="s2">is there any more profound than saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.550" end="01:15:56.630" style="s2">like we think human women look more</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.830" end="01:15:59.900" style="s2">beautiful than gorillas right like we</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.630" end="01:16:02.990" style="s2">like what we have exactly I will say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.900" end="01:16:05.960" style="s2">finding it useful to not co-mingle the</p>

<p begin="01:16:10.640" end="01:16:17.210" style="s2">more I appreciate John Searle you know I</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.240" end="01:16:20.300" style="s2">used to say sir all of his damn Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.210" end="01:16:21.950" style="s2">room.what misleading stuff but you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.300" end="01:16:22.430" style="s2">more I thought about the more appreciate</p>

<p begin="01:16:22.430" end="01:16:27.560" style="s2">Cyril argues in our consciousness is our</p>

<p begin="01:16:27.560" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">very specific so the way we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.140" end="01:16:35.480" style="s2">organized in terms of our memories that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">have a couple on various time frames we</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.480" end="01:16:40.820" style="s2">have perhaps something like Bernard bars</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:42.890" style="s2">global workspace and how all those</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.820" end="01:16:45.380" style="s2">things work produce something called</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.890" end="01:16:47.390" style="s2">consciousness and Cyril likes to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.380" end="01:16:49.910" style="s2">consciousness is a lot like digestion</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.390" end="01:16:52.580" style="s2">you can&#39;t point to some part of the body</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.910" end="01:16:55.460" style="s2">and say that&#39;s the digestion digestion</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.580" end="01:16:57.680" style="s2">is a process that includes our teeth our</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.460" end="01:17:01.880" style="s2">thread our stomach our colon our liver</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.680" end="01:17:04.910" style="s2">etc and consciousness could be thought</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.880" end="01:17:07.730" style="s2">of the same way and so you know Cyril</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.910" end="01:17:10.010" style="s2">had been laughed at by some AI</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.730" end="01:17:11.690" style="s2">researchers when they interpret him is</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.010" end="01:17:14.150" style="s2">saying that you know machine</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.690" end="01:17:15.950" style="s2">consciousness is not possible but as</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.150" end="01:17:18.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten to understand Searles</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.950" end="01:17:20.240" style="s2">argument better I think his argument is</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.230" end="01:17:22.670" style="s2">that something that it&#39;s analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.240" end="01:17:25.850" style="s2">human consciousness in a machine can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.670" end="01:17:28.400" style="s2">be the same because it&#39;s details of its</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.850" end="01:17:29.510" style="s2">design won&#39;t be the same in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.400" end="01:17:31.640" style="s2">in the food industry in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.510" end="01:17:34.400" style="s2">pharmaceutical industry we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.640" end="01:17:37.100" style="s2">digesters which are analogous to what</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.100" end="01:17:42.230" style="s2">it the same way and are very very</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.840" end="01:17:44.410" style="s2">different with respect to the details so</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.230" end="01:17:48.410" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to use consciousness in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.410" end="01:17:52.670" style="s2">narrower frame as something that is more</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.410" end="01:17:54.070" style="s2">like what humans are and so I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.670" end="01:17:55.780" style="s2">to buy the will</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.070" end="01:17:57.940" style="s2">some point had things that are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.780" end="01:18:00.610" style="s2">like our consciousnesses in a machine</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.940" end="01:18:03.010" style="s2">but that&#39;s only a small part of the much</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.010" end="01:18:08.800" style="s2">you were talking about you know what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.170" end="01:18:11.320" style="s2">the what is it like to be a loosely</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.300" end="01:19:07.599" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the kind of issue that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:10.750" style="s2">never worried about much sort of it as a</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.599" end="01:19:12.460" style="s2">mathematician originally my attitude is</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.750" end="01:19:14.020" style="s2">like you can define your word to mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.460" end="01:19:16.449" style="s2">whatever you want and then use it that</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.020" end="01:19:18.790" style="s2">way so I mean whether that really is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.449" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">intelligence or not or is some other</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.790" end="01:19:24.790" style="s2">broader thing terminology choice</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:29.260" style="s2">regarding consciousness I think you and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.790" end="01:19:31.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t entirely see it the same way but</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.260" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">vaguely close I mean when I wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.480" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">paper on consciousness basically I</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:38.079" style="s2">called it characterizing human-like</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:40.090" style="s2">consciousness I think because I</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.079" end="01:19:42.610" style="s2">considered that a sort of separate</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.090" end="01:19:44.050" style="s2">problem I mean one one type of problem</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.610" end="01:19:46.630" style="s2">is understanding nature of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.050" end="01:19:48.909" style="s2">in general which is interesting but</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.630" end="01:19:51.190" style="s2">another type of problem is you know the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.909" end="01:19:53.170" style="s2">consciousness of human-like systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.190" end="01:19:55.480" style="s2">where then you have to define what you</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.170" end="01:19:57.699" style="s2">mean by a human-like system but I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.480" end="01:20:00.429" style="s2">thinking of you know if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.699" end="01:20:01.430" style="s2">system whose goal is to control your</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.429" end="01:20:04.310" style="s2">mobile</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.430" end="01:20:07.370" style="s2">body in a much larger and more complex</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.310" end="01:20:10.310" style="s2">environment and then you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.370" end="01:20:13.670" style="s2">goals involve orchestrating actions over</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.310" end="01:20:16.730" style="s2">various time scales I think yeah these</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.670" end="01:20:19.630" style="s2">requirements sort of Drive you to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.730" end="01:20:22.310" style="s2">narrow subset of the scope of possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.630" end="01:20:23.840" style="s2">cognitive architectures and you could</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.310" end="01:20:26.360" style="s2">say then they lead you to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.840" end="01:20:29.360" style="s2">aspects of human-like consciousness I</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.360" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">think where we might differ is I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.360" end="01:20:33.110" style="s2">think Thoreau was arguing something</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">stronger than what you&#39;re saying and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.110" end="01:20:39.050" style="s2">think Searle was arguing in essence that</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:41.030" style="s2">the qualia are there in the human being</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.050" end="01:20:43.460" style="s2">and the crowley wouldn&#39;t be there in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.030" end="01:20:46.040" style="s2">digital computer and maybe since you</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.460" end="01:20:48.980" style="s2">don&#39;t take crowley seriously maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.040" end="01:20:53.030" style="s2">you&#39;re ignoring the aspect of Searles</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.980" end="01:20:55.730" style="s2">argument whereas i I do take qualia</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.030" end="01:20:58.370" style="s2">seriously but I think that Craig are</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.730" end="01:21:00.590" style="s2">universal I&#39;m a Penn psychist so then</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.370" end="01:21:03.500" style="s2">the way I look at it is you know the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.590" end="01:21:06.230" style="s2">elementary qualia associated with every</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.500" end="01:21:08.480" style="s2">percept concept entity Whitehead II in</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.230" end="01:21:11.150" style="s2">process whatever you know these organize</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.480" end="01:21:13.430" style="s2">themselves into collective system level</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.150" end="01:21:16.610" style="s2">qualia differently depending on the kind</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.430" end="01:21:19.220" style="s2">of system so that human-like species or</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.610" end="01:21:22.250" style="s2">variety of consciousness that variety of</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.220" end="01:21:24.950" style="s2">experience is associated with systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.250" end="01:21:27.350" style="s2">that are organized like a human and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.950" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">not clear that at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.350" end="01:21:32.450" style="s2">description Searle was using of like</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:35.120" style="s2">what words come in and out of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.450" end="01:21:36.890" style="s2">box of the guy in the Chinese room it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.120" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">not clear you could distinguish what is</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.890" end="01:21:42.470" style="s2">the state of consciousness of the guy</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.960" end="01:21:44.690" style="s2">inside the room so I mean his point</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.470" end="01:21:46.910" style="s2">there was sort of if if you have some</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.690" end="01:21:49.130" style="s2">giant lookup table or deep neural net or</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.910" end="01:21:51.560" style="s2">whatever inside a box that&#39;s acting like</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.130" end="01:21:53.390" style="s2">a human it doesn&#39;t have to have the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.560" end="01:21:57.620" style="s2">conscious state as iam and then I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.390" end="01:21:59.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that seems true to me but that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.620" end="01:22:02.060" style="s2">just means that that level of</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.270" end="01:22:03.770" style="s2">observation the external day that</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.060" end="01:22:06.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t let you reverse-engineer the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.770" end="01:22:09.050" style="s2">internal state right I mean it&#39;s amusing</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.740" end="01:22:10.040" style="s2">that quantum mechanics would like if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.050" end="01:22:12.020" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.040" end="01:22:14.630" style="s2">all the vibrations of the elementary</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.020" end="01:22:16.670" style="s2">particles in the universe you can induce</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.630" end="01:22:18.680" style="s2">the State of Mind of the guy inside the</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.670" end="01:22:21.200" style="s2">box right but from from the verbal</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.680" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">productions I guess you you couldn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.200" end="01:22:26.360" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know if that proves what</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:29.030" style="s2">Sura wanted it to prove really it just</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.360" end="01:22:31.640" style="s2">proves that the functional description</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.030" end="01:22:34.370" style="s2">at the crude level doesn&#39;t imply the</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.640" end="01:22:36.110" style="s2">internal state but if the state of</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.370" end="01:22:37.790" style="s2">consciousness if the qualia are</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.110" end="01:22:40.070" style="s2">associated with the internal state and</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.790" end="01:22:43.490" style="s2">dynamics and not just the crude</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.070" end="01:22:46.670" style="s2">functional description then so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.490" end="01:22:48.890" style="s2">not sure I think I think as you know we</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.670" end="01:22:51.530" style="s2">do disagree about this a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.890" end="01:22:53.270" style="s2">at some degree I do expect that when we</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.530" end="01:22:56.510" style="s2">fully understand consciousness we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.270" end="01:22:59.930" style="s2">gonna say so what it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.510" end="01:23:01.640" style="s2">less amazing than we thought however I</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.930" end="01:23:03.920" style="s2">do believe it it&#39;s cerillion in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.640" end="01:23:05.450" style="s2">sense that one would not expect</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.920" end="01:23:08.960" style="s2">consciousness from the Chinese room</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.450" end="01:23:12.310" style="s2">because consciousness is the experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.960" end="01:23:15.350" style="s2">of processing information in a specific</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.310" end="01:23:16.700" style="s2">architecture and I strongly suspect that</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.350" end="01:23:18.860" style="s2">has to do with the couplings of our</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.700" end="01:23:22.610" style="s2">memories on various time frames</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.860" end="01:23:25.610" style="s2">yeah human-like consciousness is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.610" end="01:23:28.940" style="s2">but then I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re bypassing</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.610" end="01:23:33.620" style="s2">the question of whether a tree or rock</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.940" end="01:23:36.040" style="s2">or the Internet has some form of qualia</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.620" end="01:23:38.900" style="s2">some form of awareness or experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.040" end="01:23:41.060" style="s2">yeah those like a tree maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.900" end="01:23:45.110" style="s2">know about rock but a tree could have</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.060" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">information flows with storage and sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.110" end="01:23:49.430" style="s2">of continuity perhaps you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.360" end="01:23:51.620" style="s2">distinguish physics from information</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.430" end="01:23:53.600" style="s2">every physical system can be</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.620" end="01:23:56.390" style="s2">equivalently viewed as doing information</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.600" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">processing so I mean that distinction</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.390" end="01:23:59.530" style="s2">sort of isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:01.930" style="s2">the math level yeah though it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.530" end="01:24:03.910" style="s2">simpler kind of information processing</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.930" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">one could argue well anyway this has</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.910" end="01:24:09.400" style="s2">been a truly interesting conversation so</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:13.090" style="s2">thank you very much for a very</p>
