<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where equal hear and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.950" end="00:00:21.050" style="s2">and thank you Peter for having having me</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.660" end="00:00:23.539" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.050" end="00:00:25.070" style="s2">yeah I think we did meet over over</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.539" end="00:00:27.140" style="s2">Twitter exchanges and then also maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.070" end="00:00:29.259" style="s2">some Facebook bits as well but I was uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.140" end="00:00:31.970" style="s2">you know me and many other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.259" end="00:00:35.180" style="s2">rally point alpha ap crowd were big fans</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.970" end="00:00:36.850" style="s2">of your your write up a while ago now I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.180" end="00:00:39.140" style="s2">guess this point about the culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.850" end="00:00:40.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s a topic that&#39;s near and dear</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.140" end="00:00:42.829" style="s2">to my heart although certain things have</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.970" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">now pressed themselves to higher plane</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.829" end="00:00:49.129" style="s2">of urgency but but the the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:50.690" style="s2">wanted to talk about today and actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.129" end="00:00:53.179" style="s2">let me just check real quick how much</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.690" end="00:00:57.010" style="s2">time should I take for this initial bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.179" end="00:00:59.629" style="s2">of exposition perhaps I recommend like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.010" end="00:01:02.260" style="s2">anywhere from ten to twenty five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.629" end="00:01:05.330" style="s2">oh okay that&#39;s that&#39;s quite a bit okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.260" end="00:01:06.680" style="s2">let&#39;s see how far I get in doing these</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.330" end="00:01:11.270" style="s2">chunks I don&#39;t want people to get too</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.680" end="00:01:12.260" style="s2">bored but I&#39;ll start with let&#39;s do let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.270" end="00:01:17.420" style="s2">do a part one part two</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.260" end="00:01:20.300" style="s2">okay so part one is about choice</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.420" end="00:01:23.630" style="s2">consequence of meaning and part two will</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.300" end="00:01:25.430" style="s2">be about Moloch and the system of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.630" end="00:01:29.650" style="s2">world and what this moment teaches us</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.430" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">about about that okay so so part one I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.650" end="00:01:35.540" style="s2">think the the best way to put it is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:38.810" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ll just a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.540" end="00:01:42.230" style="s2">background my contention is that here in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.810" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">the West we have a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.230" end="00:01:46.490" style="s2">individualism and we have a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">of individual rights kind of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.490" end="00:01:52.790" style="s2">sort of ground playing philosophy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:54.170" style="s2">our society and for our politics and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.790" end="00:01:55.880" style="s2">personal philosophies they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.170" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">grounded this idea that we are free</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.880" end="00:02:01.490" style="s2">we&#39;re individuals we are free we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:03.650" style="s2">freedom and if you really think about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.490" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">for the most part we don&#39;t go too far</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.650" end="00:02:08.509" style="s2">nasty well what what is freedom really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:10.429" style="s2">we just sort of say why I&#39;ve choice and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.509" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m free I mean I think most</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.429" end="00:02:14.510" style="s2">people would find that to be a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:16.550" style="s2">not an unreasonable position to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.510" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">right I can decide whatever I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.550" end="00:02:19.910" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a firefighter I give you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:22.040" style="s2">an astronaut I can go and just sit in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.910" end="00:02:24.530" style="s2">hut all day long I have choices and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.040" end="00:02:26.900" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m free and so this first</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.530" end="00:02:28.970" style="s2">part is really looking into what is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.900" end="00:02:31.970" style="s2">choice most importantly what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.970" end="00:02:37.730" style="s2">consequential choice and how that ties</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:39.170" style="s2">into actual meaning in life so the when</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.730" end="00:02:41.710" style="s2">we look at kind of generally kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.170" end="00:02:44.630" style="s2">modernity in the West here</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.710" end="00:02:46.610" style="s2">we realize that of course I&#39;m free but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.630" end="00:02:48.350" style="s2">mean I live within institutions I live</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.610" end="00:02:50.270" style="s2">in a big city I live even if I live out</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.350" end="00:02:52.490" style="s2">in the countryside I am very aware I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.270" end="00:02:54.590" style="s2">part of political structures and legal</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.490" end="00:02:56.270" style="s2">structures I&#39;m somewhat bounded I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.590" end="00:02:58.340" style="s2">really can&#39;t say I&#39;m completely free</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.270" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">obviously but if you really start</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.340" end="00:03:01.340" style="s2">thinking about it more and more you look</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:04.100" style="s2">at what is it that people do in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.340" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">daily lives well for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.100" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">people are pretty boring they have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">very set routine you could be a farmer</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:12.620" style="s2">out on 25 acres you could be a city you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:12.860" style="s2">know some some person with a job in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.620" end="00:03:15.110" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.860" end="00:03:16.910" style="s2">but people have routines and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.110" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">routines are actually quite fixed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.910" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">even given that they could do something</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.930" style="s2">different than the given day they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">do that so so this idea that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.930" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">choice and so that we&#39;re we&#39;re free well</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:29.330" style="s2">if that&#39;s the case most of us are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:32.209" style="s2">manifesting that freedom in any</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.330" end="00:03:34.070" style="s2">meaningful way so when we look at these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.209" end="00:03:35.870" style="s2">large structured institutions it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.070" end="00:03:38.120" style="s2">just they limit our choices it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.870" end="00:03:39.410" style="s2">today I could go to someplace I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:41.150" style="s2">been in the city and do something</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.410" end="00:03:44.030" style="s2">completely different but I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.150" end="00:03:47.180" style="s2">write and and the reason I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.030" end="00:03:49.220" style="s2">is because my preferences are shaped and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.180" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">my life is shaped by more than just hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.220" end="00:03:52.970" style="s2">constraints of like I can&#39;t do this or</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:54.709" style="s2">that&#39;s illegal or there&#39;s a thing in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:56.570" style="s2">way so I can&#39;t go over there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.709" end="00:03:58.250" style="s2">fence I can&#39;t go see that thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.570" end="00:04:00.380" style="s2">it&#39;s actually that we are guided</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.250" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">generally so I would say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.380" end="00:04:04.610" style="s2">big thing here the concept here is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">people generally even though they</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.610" end="00:04:07.160" style="s2">believe themselves to be free even</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.220" style="s2">though they believe that freedom is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.160" end="00:04:11.570" style="s2">manifest in a large plurality of choices</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.220" end="00:04:14.630" style="s2">for the most part that make the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.570" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">choice every single day and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.630" end="00:04:17.989" style="s2">critical component that optionality</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">though the perception of that option</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.989" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">ality is a huge part of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">psyche and and I would say that part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:25.580" style="s2">it is because it&#39;s so individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:27.560" style="s2">it&#39;s so says like I don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.580" end="00:04:29.090" style="s2">anything for you I don&#39;t have to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.560" end="00:04:30.500" style="s2">know you can&#39;t make me how many times</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:30.860" style="s2">you hear kids saying that you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.500" end="00:04:33.380" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">right and this same idea it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.380" end="00:04:36.440" style="s2">centered around the idea that we make</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">these choices and my choice is mine and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.440" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the the center of my agency is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:43.850" style="s2">that I can make choices and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:45.710" style="s2">it goes a little bit further which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.850" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">that you know I have choices and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.710" end="00:04:50.150" style="s2">have choices so we&#39;re gonna be civil to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">each other and we can pretend our</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.150" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">choices don&#39;t impact each other I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.430" style="s2">see movie a you can see movie B I call</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">it tomato you call it tomato and we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.430" end="00:04:59.870" style="s2">get on with our lives so that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">stability of social civil stability that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.870" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">emerges from even if you don&#39;t manifest</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:06.530" style="s2">those choices by making different</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">choices at least the belief that we all</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.530" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">have our individual choices lets us be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:11.539" style="s2">civil towards each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">lets us coexist right we can believe it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.539" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">we are actually not in relationship but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">I say this is complete fiction</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">right and what coronavirus has shown for</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.060" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">driving down the road and you hear on</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.440" end="00:05:51.349" style="s2">the radio</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">some little news segment that says the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.349" end="00:05:55.729" style="s2">first case of Sosa was reported in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.090" end="00:05:57.470" style="s2">city and now the government is debating</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.729" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2">whether or not to go into lockdown or</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.470" end="00:06:01.940" style="s2">something else or whatever or do we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:03.050" style="s2">to have masks whatever and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.940" end="00:06:04.820" style="s2">driving down the road and you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.050" end="00:06:07.250" style="s2">stop line you&#39;re listening this and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.820" end="00:06:10.039" style="s2">you have a choice and your choice is do</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.250" end="00:06:11.889" style="s2">I turn left and go to the store buy some</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.039" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">hand sanitizer you know just in case</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.889" end="00:06:16.190" style="s2">because this thing could be real or do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">go straight and just kind of keep going</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.190" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">home because like whatever this yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">sure when something is really bad</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:25.729" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell they will tell me and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:27.139" style="s2">know we&#39;ll figure it out I guess so so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.729" end="00:06:29.389" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the choice and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.139" end="00:06:32.120" style="s2">interesting thing about coronavirus is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.389" end="00:06:34.430" style="s2">that at that point in time no one</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.120" end="00:06:36.620" style="s2">actually knew right there was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:38.510" style="s2">this liminality that was open right then</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:40.250" style="s2">because if we absolutely if like if</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.510" end="00:06:41.479" style="s2">spaceships descended from on high and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.250" end="00:06:42.289" style="s2">said hey everyone this is a global</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.479" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">pandemic y&#39;all should take this</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.289" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">seriously and they blinked out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:46.550" style="s2">existence we would all be aligned and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">say okay you know what the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.550" end="00:06:49.909" style="s2">window you know it&#39;s snapped we all</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:53.150" style="s2">believe this is a bad thing let&#39;s go do</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.909" end="00:06:55.150" style="s2">this thing but but it wasn&#39;t that it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.150" end="00:06:57.010" style="s2">like well is it isn&#39;t it is a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.150" end="00:07:00.580" style="s2">thing is a real thing as a sciences or</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.010" end="00:07:01.990" style="s2">whatever so in that window people had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.580" end="00:07:03.580" style="s2">make a real choice and I call this a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.990" end="00:07:05.830" style="s2">consequential choice because if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.580" end="00:07:07.810" style="s2">don&#39;t take it seriously and you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.830" end="00:07:09.310" style="s2">within your rights not to you could go</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.810" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">straight and continue as you&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.310" end="00:07:14.229" style="s2">done because inaction is still a choice</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:15.639" style="s2">and you keep going to bars and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.229" end="00:07:18.100" style="s2">like you know here in Austin which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.639" end="00:07:19.780" style="s2">where I am you know 70 people from</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.100" end="00:07:21.729" style="s2">University of Texas so many students</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.780" end="00:07:23.110" style="s2">flew down to Florida to you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.729" end="00:07:24.850" style="s2">doing their Florida Party thing and half</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.110" end="00:07:26.889" style="s2">of them now have coronavirus right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.850" end="00:07:28.150" style="s2">they made a choice to just carry on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.889" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">choice had a consequence right</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.150" end="00:07:31.479" style="s2">you could also decide wait wait maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:32.979" style="s2">should take this seriously in just in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.479" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">case I&#39;m gonna go and just get a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.979" end="00:07:36.190" style="s2">extra hand sanitizer get a little toilet</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:37.570" style="s2">paper or whatever it is right I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:39.550" style="s2">actually modeling out what this thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.570" end="00:07:41.800" style="s2">really how how kinda me really plays out</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.550" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna at least try to like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.800" end="00:07:44.949" style="s2">it&#39;s hand sanitizers just I have it with</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:47.410" style="s2">me just be a little bit safer so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.949" end="00:07:49.180" style="s2">make a choice even in action even status</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.410" end="00:07:51.460" style="s2">quo is a choice and here&#39;s the kicker</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.180" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">that choice has a consequence right</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:55.560" style="s2">because two weeks from now we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">out how well you did now can you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.560" end="00:07:59.979" style="s2">like walking down the street if someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:00.970" style="s2">jumps in front of you the gun points at</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.979" end="00:08:02.950" style="s2">you and says hey give me all your money</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.970" end="00:08:04.270" style="s2">you have a consequential choice there -</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.950" end="00:08:06.940" style="s2">right because depending on what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.270" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">choose a consequence a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.940" end="00:08:10.900" style="s2">consequence presents itself to you but</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">with this case of coronavirus there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.900" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">this lag right you make the decision and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:16.419" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of fretting about it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.130" end="00:08:18.310" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of like oh crap oh crap oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.419" end="00:08:20.740" style="s2">crap and like maybe two weeks later you</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.310" end="00:08:23.020" style="s2">find out oh crap I just pass something</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.740" end="00:08:25.389" style="s2">on to my you know aging parents or I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.020" end="00:08:27.070" style="s2">just oh my god I think I gave that to my</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.389" end="00:08:29.020" style="s2">friend because I went to that party and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.070" end="00:08:31.240" style="s2">then I also went this other party holy</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.020" end="00:08:33.700" style="s2">crap right the consequence is in a void</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.240" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">of unavoidable right the the the virus</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.700" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">itself the SARS coronavirus - doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.310" style="s2">care whether you eat Fox News or watch</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:41.830" style="s2">CNN or whatever it just it does what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.310" end="00:08:44.950" style="s2">does so this idea that people now have</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.830" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">to make a choice a real choice and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.950" end="00:08:48.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a consequence that unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:52.810" style="s2">non-narrative narrator bowl away</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.760" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">consequence and then there&#39;s a lag super</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.810" end="00:08:56.380" style="s2">interesting because that lag forces this</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:08:59.860" style="s2">luma this liminal window to be open for</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.380" end="00:09:03.820" style="s2">quite some time and and in this context</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.860" end="00:09:05.800" style="s2">I want to sort of I want to sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.820" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">know just highlight that when you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.800" end="00:09:08.740" style="s2">faced with this you might also have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:10.330" style="s2">little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.740" end="00:09:12.430" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see step above yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.330" end="00:09:14.200" style="s2">say you know what why is this particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.430" end="00:09:16.540" style="s2">decision harder for me than all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.200" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">other decisions in my life because look</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.540" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">at my life I&#39;ve decided to go on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">trip or I decided to get married or I</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:24.580" style="s2">decided to you know change jobs or I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.959" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">decided to move to this town right you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.580" end="00:09:27.940" style="s2">know any number of things have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:29.709" style="s2">decided I make decisions all the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.940" end="00:09:31.480" style="s2">right and it turns out no you make</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.709" end="00:09:34.570" style="s2">choices but really they&#39;re expressions</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.480" end="00:09:38.680" style="s2">of preference most people in stable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2">a middle-class Western countries it I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.680" end="00:09:42.430" style="s2">would hope maybe for not many people but</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">but I hope this moment presents them a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.430" end="00:09:46.330" style="s2">bit of self-awareness that this choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:48.580" style="s2">is unlike most of the other choices that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.330" end="00:09:51.220" style="s2">you have been making in your life and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.580" end="00:09:53.770" style="s2">fact this is a real choice is a real</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.220" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">decision a consequential one most of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.770" end="00:09:58.029" style="s2">other decisions and choices you make are</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2">basically totally it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.029" end="00:10:02.110" style="s2">what color car do you want what color is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:03.790" style="s2">your hat well I guess that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.110" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">whole thing around that but like what</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.790" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">what toppings you want on your pizza</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:08.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not a choice that&#39;s not freedom</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">that&#39;s preference and the reason you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.200" end="00:10:11.560" style="s2">want some new freight you know fancy</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:15.100" style="s2">pizzas because you saw the freaking ad</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.560" end="00:10:18.100" style="s2">on TV last week right so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.100" end="00:10:20.890" style="s2">that that not just a few individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.100" end="00:10:23.020" style="s2">every single person has to make a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.890" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">consequential choice that&#39;s like life</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.020" end="00:10:28.839" style="s2">and death consequences and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">do it all kind of at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.839" end="00:10:33.640" style="s2">there&#39;s this gap when we find out how</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:34.600" style="s2">what we did and then the really the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.640" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">really interesting kickers there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.600" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">social aspect to it too which is I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.700" end="00:10:40.329" style="s2">only one making a consequential you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:41.709" style="s2">making this decision and I decided one</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.329" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">way but all of y&#39;all decide different</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.709" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">way we have a worse outcome but if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.829" style="s2">all decide the same way right if we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">decides as a hoax it would carry on with</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.829" end="00:10:50.709" style="s2">the economy the economy doesn&#39;t crash</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:51.940" style="s2">bunch of people gonna die maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.709" end="00:10:53.890" style="s2">than the should&#39;ve but the economy</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.940" end="00:10:56.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t crash if we all decide holy crap</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.890" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">this would kill everyone is pandemic we</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.380" end="00:11:01.209" style="s2">all walk down the economy crashes but</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">few people die right and that fewer</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">movements and so the game a world has</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.970" end="00:11:51.910" style="s2">been really really good at giving people</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:54.070" style="s2">a stringing them along with a small a</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.290" end="00:12:07.480" style="s2">decisions so ultimately these little</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.480" end="00:12:10.690" style="s2">almost like a lobster trap or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:12.700" style="s2">else it kind of funnels them into a part</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.700" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">they&#39;re screwed like their long-term</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.050" end="00:12:18.520" style="s2">optionality is strategic optionality is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:19.899" style="s2">compressed but it feels like real</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.899" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the game that&#39;s the trick</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.580" end="00:12:24.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the lobster trap right so like</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">right or do I get this upgrade on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.490" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">car I mean it&#39;s just at the edge of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:35.500" style="s2">I came into the dealership with my</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:36.820" style="s2">budget but I can you know what I do this</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.820" end="00:12:41.589" style="s2">all these little decisions right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:44.860" style="s2">there to give people in a moment a way</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.860" end="00:12:47.770" style="s2">they&#39;re trading away is large</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:49.390" style="s2">optionality and that does little as of</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:28.210" style="s2">they&#39;re constantly eating I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.390" end="00:16:32.170" style="s2">a perfect perfect metaphor for the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.210" end="00:16:33.760" style="s2">of as if choices that crowd people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:35.170" style="s2">lives the as if decisions they have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.760" end="00:16:36.339" style="s2">make there&#39;s really not that many</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.170" end="00:16:38.920" style="s2">decision people really need to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.339" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">because the big decisions are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.920" end="00:16:42.610" style="s2">with consequence so if a decision or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:44.380" style="s2">choice doesn&#39;t change here in long term</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.610" end="00:16:45.550" style="s2">consequence doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.380" end="00:16:48.550" style="s2">really a choice just go with whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:50.589" style="s2">right so I think this the key thing here</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.550" end="00:16:52.420" style="s2">is that because people have been just</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.589" end="00:16:54.279" style="s2">baking making preference</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.420" end="00:16:56.950" style="s2">choices and not real consequential</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.279" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">choices there&#39;s a lack of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.950" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lack of endowment</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:14.410" style="s2">neighborhood of town right all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.319" end="00:17:16.449" style="s2">kinds of things ultimately create that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.410" end="00:17:17.920" style="s2">meaning crisis because meaning comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.449" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">from people being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.920" end="00:17:21.160" style="s2">consequential choices owning those</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.500" style="s2">choices and seeing them through to their</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.160" end="00:17:25.179" style="s2">consequence and then and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.500" end="00:17:27.870" style="s2">cranking that loop and saying I actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.179" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">have a part in the trajectory of my life</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.870" end="00:17:36.370" style="s2">so ok I&#39;ll wrap up phase one or part one</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:40.540" style="s2">with that thoughts feedback Peter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.370" end="00:17:42.460" style="s2">do you want to jump into some Q&amp;A there</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.540" end="00:17:44.679" style="s2">do ya let&#39;s go ahead and let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.460" end="00:17:47.559" style="s2">couple questions and see so we got here</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.679" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">sure so if anyone has any questions you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.559" end="00:17:50.170" style="s2">can write in the chat box I have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">questions right now which i&#39;ll warm</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.170" end="00:17:53.980" style="s2">peter up with again if you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">read to just to indicate that and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.980" end="00:17:59.620" style="s2">chat so yeah I really liked all that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.640" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">then the phrase that came to mind I</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.620" end="00:18:02.850" style="s2">think it&#39;d be good to run with it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:07.290" style="s2">that this whole thing is an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.850" end="00:18:08.760" style="s2">for freedom and so do you like that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.290" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">specific phrase do you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.760" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">going to be encouraging for people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.990" end="00:18:14.460" style="s2">think that way um I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:15.990" style="s2">might be a narrative bridge too far</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.460" end="00:18:17.430" style="s2">right now but I would say it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.990" end="00:18:21.060" style="s2">opportunity for meaning it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.430" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">opportunity to to like I maybe encourage</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.060" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">people to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:29.460" style="s2">intentional in in self-aware and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">reflecting on why they&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.460" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">things they&#39;re doing right right because</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:34.260" style="s2">this is a consequential choice this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.970" end="00:18:35.940" style="s2">not just choosing which color you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.260" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">in your car this is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.940" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">quite important how are you getting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">that decision and as they walk through</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:43.560" style="s2">it and as they as they walk that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:46.380" style="s2">of actual explicit intentional decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.560" end="00:18:48.030" style="s2">making they&#39;re gonna realize oh I you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.380" end="00:18:49.620" style="s2">know why don&#39;t I have to do this more</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.030" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">often well maybe they won&#39;t realize but</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.620" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">we should encourage them to think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:54.180" style="s2">why don&#39;t you do this more often</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:55.620" style="s2">why do you not have the skills to do an</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.180" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">explicit sense making loop around</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.620" end="00:19:01.050" style="s2">something like this is it either a your</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:04.050" style="s2">life is so privileged and comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.050" end="00:19:06.300" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to or is it be that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.050" end="00:19:08.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve been you&#39;re basically a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.300" end="00:19:11.190" style="s2">and a feedlot you know you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.010" end="00:19:14.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s bad it&#39;s not safe right right</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.190" end="00:19:15.930" style="s2">and how are you personally in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.130" end="00:19:17.430" style="s2">consequential we&#39;re gonna call it the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.930" end="00:19:18.870" style="s2">consequential legs and the consequential</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.430" end="00:19:22.110" style="s2">gap how are you personally like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.870" end="00:19:23.820" style="s2">operating in this state um well I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.110" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">give myself about a c-minus because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.820" end="00:19:27.510" style="s2">have a full-time job better runner this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:29.070" style="s2">is a company and I got a steer that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.510" end="00:19:31.260" style="s2">thing through various things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.070" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">maybe not maybe not see - there I should</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.260" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">give myself a little more you know we</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:34.860" style="s2">have to learn to forgive ourselves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.020" style="s2">one of the things that we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.860" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">here right is treating the whole body</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.020" end="00:19:41.460" style="s2">treating the whole mind training all</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:43.560" style="s2">these things in our egos as well so</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.460" end="00:19:44.670" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m not doing C - but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.560" end="00:19:46.440" style="s2">think I&#39;m doing I don&#39;t think I&#39;m even</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.670" end="00:19:48.570" style="s2">doing any - I think I could do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.440" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">better the way I&#39;m trying to track it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.570" end="00:19:52.620" style="s2">I do try to spend some part of my day</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:53.880" style="s2">understand the broader scope what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.620" end="00:19:55.110" style="s2">going on and I spend some part of my day</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.880" end="00:19:56.310" style="s2">talking to people and just asking</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.110" end="00:19:58.110" style="s2">questions like how are you thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.310" end="00:20:00.360" style="s2">about this here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.110" end="00:20:02.820" style="s2">open about what I don&#39;t know and I asked</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.360" end="00:20:04.800" style="s2">I try to get input from people and even</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.820" end="00:20:06.660" style="s2">within the company you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.800" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">trying to think about how do we model</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.660" end="00:20:08.790" style="s2">what the economy&#39;s going to look like</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:10.890" style="s2">you know there&#39;s gonna be complete</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.790" end="00:20:12.270" style="s2">disaster is it gonna we start are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.890" end="00:20:14.040" style="s2">go to war with China and then we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.270" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">wartime economy and we should go try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.040" end="00:20:17.010" style="s2">get some of those sweet defense</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">contracts like what is the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.010" end="00:20:19.920" style="s2">do to take care of the people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.380" style="s2">responsible for right so there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.920" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">for me it&#39;s just asking more questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.380" end="00:20:27.300" style="s2">more intently and more explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">reaching out and looking for what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.300" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">would call the gosh had a cute term for</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:35.400" style="s2">this a year ago but I forgot it now but</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:37.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this it&#39;s almost like creating</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.400" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">a negative capacity in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.140" end="00:20:40.920" style="s2">basically carving out a way to say no</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">you&#39;re full of and just have that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.920" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">person on your left shoulder all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:46.860" style="s2">time right constantly saying here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">thing you don&#39;t like and you hate it but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.860" end="00:20:49.890" style="s2">what if it was right and now I generally</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:51.420" style="s2">run with that anyway like generally that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.890" end="00:20:53.400" style="s2">person is always there but in this case</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.420" end="00:20:57.330" style="s2">I have to more intentionally explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.400" end="00:21:01.680" style="s2">manifest that that person or that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.330" end="00:21:03.060" style="s2">cognitive center because I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.680" end="00:21:04.710" style="s2">mean I we&#39;re in this liminal zone</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.060" end="00:21:06.330" style="s2">I think the mainstream narratives about</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.710" end="00:21:08.160" style="s2">this virus are I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.330" end="00:21:10.260" style="s2">mainstream narratives about what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.160" end="00:21:12.030" style="s2">consequences might be are</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.260" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">because what I realize is that if even</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.030" end="00:21:16.380" style="s2">any of these are partially true the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">consequence must be that there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.380" end="00:21:20.430" style="s2">state-level massive diplomacy things</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.840" end="00:21:22.770" style="s2">happening right now to avoid World War 3</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.430" end="00:21:24.750" style="s2">and if those things collapsed and I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.770" end="00:21:25.800" style="s2">not trust leadership in the structure of</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.430" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">response to that kind of so like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of stuff I try to reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.580" end="00:21:57.300" style="s2">about but then I try to you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:21:59.220" style="s2">just trying to run multiple loops at</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.800" end="00:22:08.340" style="s2">originally I was born there</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:09.690" style="s2">here in America where obviously you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.340" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">racist sentiments have been stoked for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.690" end="00:22:14.820" style="s2">political purposes for last 20 years so</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not great but I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:21.150" style="s2">spaces so I&#39;m looking at everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.260" end="00:22:23.460" style="s2">about how unpleasant it is right right</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.150" end="00:22:25.620" style="s2">so we have some questions popping up in</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.460" end="00:22:28.980" style="s2">the chat area would you like to read</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.620" end="00:22:30.850" style="s2">your question to Peter sure I would love</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.980" end="00:22:34.840" style="s2">to hi Peter thanks sorry</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.850" end="00:22:37.030" style="s2">my question and maybe the wording is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.840" end="00:22:39.070" style="s2">as clean as I&#39;d like it to be but do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.030" end="00:22:41.260" style="s2">feel like this situation with Koba it</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.070" end="00:22:43.690" style="s2">will raise awareness for slash do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.260" end="00:22:46.390" style="s2">think that we&#39;re even capable of making</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.690" end="00:22:48.190" style="s2">intentional consequences consequential</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.390" end="00:22:50.170" style="s2">choices where our consequences aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:52.650" style="s2">seen through for like another 10 or so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.170" end="00:22:55.390" style="s2">years so something like climate change</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.650" end="00:22:58.420" style="s2">where the work where the choices that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.390" end="00:23:01.510" style="s2">were making now you know we won&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.420" end="00:23:01.960" style="s2">see the consequences for years and years</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.510" end="00:23:04.210" style="s2">to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.960" end="00:23:05.380" style="s2">whereas like we&#39;re struggling to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.210" end="00:23:07.060" style="s2">choices where we won&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.380" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">consequences for another two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.060" end="00:23:13.630" style="s2">right right very good question I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">there&#39;s I hope well it&#39;s it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.630" end="00:23:17.710" style="s2">journey of a thousand miles starts with</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">a first step right and if in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.710" end="00:23:23.050" style="s2">process we restore a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:25.540" style="s2">credibility for mathematical modeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.050" end="00:23:27.340" style="s2">for data-driven decision if we put a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.540" end="00:23:30.990" style="s2">little bit more rigor into how science</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.340" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">and the public sector our intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.990" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">like public intellectuals or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">how these scientists hold journalists</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:39.130" style="s2">accountable for crafting mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">narratives because I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.130" end="00:23:42.040" style="s2">does all these different things we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:44.110" style="s2">institutional break down in these styles</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.040" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">levels that&#39;s what we can&#39;t make do</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.110" end="00:23:48.370" style="s2">sense making decisioning on these long</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:49.930" style="s2">time frames and I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.370" end="00:23:51.880" style="s2">currently what it does is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.930" end="00:23:54.280" style="s2">like when a train locomotive backs up</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.880" end="00:23:55.690" style="s2">and then pulls forward right I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.280" end="00:23:56.770" style="s2">right now it&#39;s a backing up moment so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.690" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">get a little bit at least get a couple</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">of the first rail cars hooked up to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">locomotive of actually having you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">data-driven explicit intentional science</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">and modeling around long term</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:11.890" style="s2">consequences and broad consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.250" end="00:24:13.330" style="s2">and I&#39;ll cite two things one is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.890" end="00:24:15.430" style="s2">conversation with Tristan Harris and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.330" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">he was just pointing out that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.430" end="00:24:19.390" style="s2">the it&#39;s we shouldn&#39;t give ourselves too</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:21.400" style="s2">much well maybe who&#39;s quite saying this</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.390" end="00:24:23.080" style="s2">but saying we should expect it should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.400" end="00:24:25.060" style="s2">natural that people have trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.080" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">this kind of thing because our primary</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.060" end="00:24:28.750" style="s2">brain stem in our emotional centers and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2">all these things that whole the sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.750" end="00:24:33.400" style="s2">making loop of human brain fits inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.160" end="00:24:35.470" style="s2">of human brain right and it&#39;s it nature</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.400" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">usually doesn&#39;t over-engineer so is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.470" end="00:24:39.970" style="s2">designed to make consequential decisions</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:41.470" style="s2">roaming the African savannah right is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.970" end="00:24:42.730" style="s2">this thing gonna kill me is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.470" end="00:24:44.350" style="s2">coming at me really fast does it look</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.730" end="00:24:45.940" style="s2">like the sharp teeth I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.350" end="00:24:47.950" style="s2">run right there&#39;s like these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.940" end="00:24:49.809" style="s2">consequential decisions you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.950" end="00:24:51.730" style="s2">to sit there and say yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.809" end="00:24:52.870" style="s2">drew some stuff on a cave wall and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.730" end="00:24:54.669" style="s2">gonna give it two weeks I&#39;m gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.870" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">what happens like you don&#39;t run doodle</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.669" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">hoops like that right you basically you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:24:59.470" style="s2">know you should you throw pointy things</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:00.669" style="s2">that things to eat them or things with</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.470" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">pointing these come at you and you run</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.669" end="00:25:04.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s your general like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:05.350" style="s2">OODA loop that&#39;s the the frequency or</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.120" end="00:25:07.450" style="s2">the timeframe the characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.350" end="00:25:09.970" style="s2">wavelength of time that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.450" end="00:25:13.720" style="s2">solve for so the fact that we are able</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.970" end="00:25:15.160" style="s2">to build collectives to integrate over a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.720" end="00:25:17.289" style="s2">broader period of time over a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.160" end="00:25:19.270" style="s2">complex set of phenomenon is amazing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.289" end="00:25:20.980" style="s2">it of its own self to try to do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.270" end="00:25:22.929" style="s2">over ten years that&#39;s a big that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.980" end="00:25:24.669" style="s2">bigger leap and and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.929" end="00:25:25.990" style="s2">this is a first step to getting there</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.669" end="00:25:27.850" style="s2">but we&#39;ve got to get people into at</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.990" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">least running that just one-week</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.850" end="00:25:29.860" style="s2">two-week loop will be that we great</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:31.690" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.860" end="00:25:34.419" style="s2">the second thing though the keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.690" end="00:25:35.950" style="s2">is that we have to it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.419" end="00:25:38.530" style="s2">journalism and the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.950" end="00:25:39.730" style="s2">infrastructure for all of society it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.530" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">all about the broken and corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.730" end="00:25:44.110" style="s2">institutions right and you see this a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:45.850" style="s2">little bit with the Trump versus the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.110" end="00:25:47.380" style="s2">World Health Organization bit right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.850" end="00:25:49.390" style="s2">I&#39;m generally I&#39;ll have you follow me on</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.380" end="00:25:50.860" style="s2">Twitter I&#39;m not the world&#39;s biggest fan</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.390" end="00:25:53.230" style="s2">of Donald Trump I&#39;m pretty far down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.860" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">ladder there but I think he&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.230" end="00:25:55.419" style="s2">right to go after the World Health</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">Organization because they absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.419" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">took the corrupt Chinese government at</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:00.850" style="s2">their word okay even as they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">burning tens of thousands like they were</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.850" end="00:26:04.929" style="s2">creating thousands of bodies or tens of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:06.039" style="s2">thousands of bodies a week in Wuhan and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.929" end="00:26:07.630" style="s2">they were telling me what else well I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.039" end="00:26:09.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know is there human to human</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.630" end="00:26:12.070" style="s2">transmission you know like no come on</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.730" end="00:26:13.539" style="s2">come on right so this is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.070" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">thing that it&#39;s right to hold those</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.539" end="00:26:17.530" style="s2">accountable for but it shows that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:19.390" style="s2">this is gonna be where you know bringing</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.530" end="00:26:21.070" style="s2">the eric weinstein point that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.390" end="00:26:23.260" style="s2">basically since the 70s or 80s we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.070" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">these hollowed out institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.260" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">kind of do the theater they engage in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:29.770" style="s2">some cafes the theatre of oh well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">the blah blah blah we&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.770" end="00:26:32.740" style="s2">things and we put out we have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">meeting and we did this this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:37.059" style="s2">hold on a second we can&#39;t even figure</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:38.679" style="s2">out you know where this thing came from</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.059" end="00:26:40.059" style="s2">you&#39;re telling me you can&#39;t even tell me</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.679" end="00:26:41.950" style="s2">if there&#39;s human human transmission what</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.059" end="00:26:44.350" style="s2">those rates look like what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.950" end="00:26:46.330" style="s2">right so the problem is if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.350" end="00:26:48.789" style="s2">put science forward science has got to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.330" end="00:26:50.679" style="s2">clean up its act right and the broken of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.789" end="00:26:52.600" style="s2">corrupt institutions of academia the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.679" end="00:26:54.850" style="s2">funding vehicles I mean like I worked</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.850" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">DARPA I&#39;ve worked with many institutions</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.890" end="00:26:59.540" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.770" end="00:27:02.120" style="s2">when you really get in there and you see</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.540" end="00:27:03.950" style="s2">you go to the backside of the kitchen or</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.120" end="00:27:05.990" style="s2">the restaurant you see a kitchen you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.950" end="00:27:07.880" style="s2">how the sausage is made it&#39;s not pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.990" end="00:27:09.140" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s a you know we talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.880" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">about the revolving door of lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.140" end="00:27:13.010" style="s2">and things like that in Washington but</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:14.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a revolving door of academics</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.010" end="00:27:16.340" style="s2">going to these institutions becoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.600" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">program managers one hand washing the</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.429" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">there there&#39;s like there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">general kind of corrupt bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:28.820" style="s2">whenever you get humans into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">state and so if we want to actually do</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.820" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">ten year level decisioning and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.770" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.850" end="00:27:36.020" style="s2">for things like climate change which I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:37.309" style="s2">think we actually have to do science has</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.020" end="00:27:38.929" style="s2">got to get better too it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.309" end="00:27:42.110" style="s2">about journalism or fake news</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.929" end="00:27:43.910" style="s2">or idiot citizenry who are uneducated is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.110" end="00:27:45.500" style="s2">that the institutions of science</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.910" end="00:27:48.140" style="s2">academia are rather corrupt at this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.500" end="00:27:51.710" style="s2">point I&#39;m long answer for a very short</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.140" end="00:27:54.170" style="s2">but very good question sorry and just to</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.710" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">plug Pat Ryan did a talk related to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.170" end="00:27:56.630" style="s2">which is on the YouTube channel I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:27:59.420" style="s2">send you that that Peter if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.630" end="00:28:01.429" style="s2">interested or even you had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.420" end="00:28:10.970" style="s2">question would you like to follow up</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.429" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">with it sure hi amazing I was just on</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.970" end="00:28:16.400" style="s2">your Twitter this morning I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:21.110" style="s2">pretty hard I pretty got I&#39;m pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.400" end="00:28:26.210" style="s2">down the rabbit hole for sure wondering</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.110" end="00:28:28.730" style="s2">about the ability for us to see this see</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.210" end="00:28:30.380" style="s2">this event through see the kind of lag</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.730" end="00:28:32.929" style="s2">in our ability to make decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.380" end="00:28:35.059" style="s2">apply that to more wicked problems such</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.929" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">as such as climate change where we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.059" end="00:28:39.950" style="s2">this this increased lag but the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:42.110" style="s2">question I put into the chat was also</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.950" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">about like communities that have modeled</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.110" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">accurate sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:50.540" style="s2">like I know that a lot of tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:52.910" style="s2">like instituted like remote work very</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.540" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">early on in this process and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.910" end="00:28:55.790" style="s2">you mentioned like the OODA loop so</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:28:59.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of startups that already</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.790" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">have these like these models kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.450" end="00:29:03.350" style="s2">their in their businesses so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:06.530" style="s2">of wondering about like what communities</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:10.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re kind of psycho technology or</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.530" end="00:29:11.270" style="s2">organizational structures have succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.520" end="00:29:13.730" style="s2">in making</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.270" end="00:29:16.010" style="s2">good choices and how you think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.730" end="00:29:20.690" style="s2">might impact the future evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.010" end="00:29:22.700" style="s2">culture okay fun question so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.690" end="00:29:24.200" style="s2">absolutely right that the tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.700" end="00:29:26.450" style="s2">seem to have moved a little bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.200" end="00:29:28.700" style="s2">in fact my my company and the very first</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.450" end="00:29:29.900" style="s2">week of March the first Thursday is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.700" end="00:29:31.429" style="s2">we told everyone work from home for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.900" end="00:29:32.570" style="s2">rest of the month at least and the part</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.429" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">of that was because we&#39;re here in Austin</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.570" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2">and South by Southwest was about to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:37.250" style="s2">descend upon us the next week and I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:42.650" style="s2">we&#39;re just not even I&#39;m not even messing</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.250" end="00:29:45.950" style="s2">around right however I would I do think</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.650" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">some there are communities and subgroups</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.950" end="00:29:50.929" style="s2">or subcultures that have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:53.559" style="s2">better since making or engaged in higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.929" end="00:29:57.620" style="s2">quality sense-making around this but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.559" end="00:30:00.500" style="s2">think that we should be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.620" end="00:30:03.410" style="s2">two possible anti-patterns one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.500" end="00:30:05.059" style="s2">don&#39;t do is just match against like oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.410" end="00:30:08.260" style="s2">tech companies right or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.059" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">classical no classical standard or easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.260" end="00:30:13.309" style="s2">taxonomy of people of tribes and of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:14.660" style="s2">coherent structures or coherent movement</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.309" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">and sense making structures I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.660" end="00:30:21.800" style="s2">those uh those will potentially drag in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:23.809" style="s2">a lot of additional variables that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.800" end="00:30:25.970" style="s2">proxies right so for instance if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.809" end="00:30:27.230" style="s2">the top a tech company or if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.970" end="00:30:28.220" style="s2">one of these tech companies they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.230" end="00:30:30.170" style="s2">organizations tend to be little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.220" end="00:30:32.330" style="s2">flatter they can be connected to VCS</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.170" end="00:30:35.240" style="s2">which are broad dissemination nexuses</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.330" end="00:30:37.250" style="s2">for billionaires and other people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.240" end="00:30:39.410" style="s2">are truly truly in the know on secret</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.250" end="00:30:41.030" style="s2">stuff right so there&#39;s just almost like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.410" end="00:30:43.250" style="s2">it&#39;s an unfair competition a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.030" end="00:30:47.750" style="s2">because they&#39;re closer access to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.250" end="00:30:49.010" style="s2">edge of whatever is known globally so by</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.750" end="00:30:50.150" style="s2">that structure so not like they do</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.010" end="00:30:51.500" style="s2">better you know loops in fact they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.150" end="00:30:54.440" style="s2">little loops may be piss-poor there may</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.500" end="00:30:56.540" style="s2">be a lot more tribal groupthink there</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.440" end="00:30:58.250" style="s2">but they just have me closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.540" end="00:31:00.020" style="s2">upstream so I want to make sure we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.250" end="00:31:02.750" style="s2">inadvertently alias along those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.020" end="00:31:05.929" style="s2">boundaries and what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.750" end="00:31:07.460" style="s2">if I were to run a real program to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.929" end="00:31:08.750" style="s2">analyze to look at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.460" end="00:31:10.400" style="s2">communities that did good work and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.750" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">think the verdict is is also too early</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.400" end="00:31:15.530" style="s2">to tell right jury still out of who did</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:17.500" style="s2">a good job or didn&#39;t but I would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:20.120" style="s2">generally biasing towards looking for</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.500" end="00:31:23.270" style="s2">emergent patterns of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.120" end="00:31:24.600" style="s2">connection as the topology from which I</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.270" end="00:31:27.090" style="s2">would then cluster in group</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.600" end="00:31:28.770" style="s2">people not on any other kind of I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.090" end="00:31:31.260" style="s2">would not label them by their physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.770" end="00:31:32.130" style="s2">location and by their place of work and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.260" end="00:31:34.350" style="s2">things like that because those are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.130" end="00:31:36.060" style="s2">strong Network affiliation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.350" end="00:31:38.970" style="s2">factors but I will try to go to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.060" end="00:31:41.280" style="s2">broader higher dimensional graph to look</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.970" end="00:31:43.410" style="s2">at how we cluster cohorts now once we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.280" end="00:31:45.930" style="s2">done the cohort analysis completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.410" end="00:31:49.110" style="s2">naive kind of cohort analysis see who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.930" end="00:31:51.510" style="s2">actually close to who um once we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.110" end="00:31:53.010" style="s2">that I think the thing I would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.510" end="00:31:54.300" style="s2">looking for then did you know mug</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.010" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">analysis I would do within each cohort</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.300" end="00:31:59.460" style="s2">is is actually on you use a good word</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">like the psycho technology it would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.460" end="00:32:04.980" style="s2">on the basis of the people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">and what those people are like and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.980" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">their ways of relating to each other is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">like because I fundamentally I think in</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:14.030" style="s2">the game you see this kind of in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:16.920" style="s2">of the game be sort of stuff is that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.030" end="00:32:19.530" style="s2">we really tried to think about the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.920" end="00:32:21.560" style="s2">connection and the human connection is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.530" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">the architecture right the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.560" end="00:32:25.260" style="s2">connection graph and the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.580" end="00:32:28.560" style="s2">relational capabilities that is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.260" end="00:32:30.180" style="s2">capability and and the best sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.560" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">around this stuff is not through reading</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.180" end="00:32:34.680" style="s2">the it&#39;s not like I read and subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">to higher funded institutions</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.680" end="00:32:38.280" style="s2">institutional sense making things like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:41.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a $10,000 a month subscription</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:43.080" style="s2">to some like secret ooh BRR like you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.460" end="00:32:44.160" style="s2">know best info in the world site or</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.080" end="00:32:45.870" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s not how this</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.160" end="00:32:47.610" style="s2">works it&#39;s cuz I&#39;m connect to certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.870" end="00:32:49.500" style="s2">people who I trust very very deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.610" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">they are connect to other people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.500" end="00:32:53.190" style="s2">they also trust and hold in high regard</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:54.300" style="s2">and we in fact have a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.190" end="00:32:55.320" style="s2">firewalls between each other so when I</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.300" end="00:33:01.470" style="s2">to other people and this looks very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.460" end="00:33:03.420" style="s2">much like a brain neuronal graph it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.470" end="00:33:05.070" style="s2">not rocket science it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.420" end="00:33:06.600" style="s2">neuroscience I guess right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.070" end="00:33:08.880" style="s2">about having high trusted connections</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.600" end="00:33:10.590" style="s2">it&#39;s about having a human network and no</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.880" end="00:33:13.620" style="s2">technology so plants the human network</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.590" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">right so I think there&#39;s a deep thing I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.620" end="00:33:18.690" style="s2">would be looking at there is that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:20.250" style="s2">would be looking for I&#39;ll be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.690" end="00:33:23.370" style="s2">one you know figure out a way to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.250" end="00:33:24.810" style="s2">that large high dimensionality cohort</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.370" end="00:33:27.480" style="s2">analysis and then within each cohort</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.810" end="00:33:29.430" style="s2">doing the genomic analysis of their by</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.480" end="00:33:30.840" style="s2">genomic I mean their patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.430" end="00:33:32.460" style="s2">interaction how do the individuals their</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.840" end="00:33:35.460" style="s2">you know think and rate rate to each</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.460" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">other cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.460" end="00:33:44.629" style="s2">Amy you had a question so I I live in</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:52.169" style="s2">New York and I&#39;ve been kind of struck by</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.629" end="00:33:54.239" style="s2">two different types I felt like people</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.239" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">beginning and now I think that they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.549" end="00:34:03.719" style="s2">very much like masks we have to wear</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:06.269" style="s2">masks and not save us all and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.719" end="00:34:09.210" style="s2">something that is very untethered to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.269" end="00:34:10.230" style="s2">idea of an autonomous choice and yet</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.210" end="00:34:12.859" style="s2">there&#39;s also something that&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.859" end="00:34:19.109" style="s2">almost subconscious or subliminal where</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.799" end="00:34:21.029" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.109" end="00:34:25.529" style="s2">thing that undergirds people&#39;s choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.029" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">making that kind of I don&#39;t I don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.529" end="00:34:31.529" style="s2">it very very conscious on a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.529" end="00:34:34.980" style="s2">don&#39;t social distance even though very</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:37.079" style="s2">free they went out here so I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.980" end="00:34:41.220" style="s2">about like the social consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.079" end="00:34:43.950" style="s2">making unpopular choices and whether or</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.220" end="00:34:49.039" style="s2">not you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of vectoring</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.039" end="00:34:55.319" style="s2">to hell with photons or maybe social</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.549" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">consequences aren&#39;t as important as</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">more complex there&#39;s just a little</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.240" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">that we allow a place for shaman to come</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:02.650" style="s2">back and lead us to the neck across the</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.980" end="00:40:16.059" style="s2">how do we hold open that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.870" end="00:40:18.309" style="s2">discernment and so I think in your</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.239" end="00:41:55.449" style="s2">question about infinite games yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.979" end="00:41:57.459" style="s2">question I&#39;ve got on it was very early</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.449" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">on in the conversation I think you evoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.459" end="00:42:02.829" style="s2">to me this the understanding around game</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:05.170" style="s2">theory and and finite games use the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.829" end="00:42:06.729" style="s2">prisoner&#39;s dilemma so I knew there made</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.170" end="00:42:08.140" style="s2">reference to lots lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.729" end="00:42:10.569" style="s2">finite games where it&#39;s who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.140" end="00:42:12.999" style="s2">college or mmm-hmm who gets the girl or</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.569" end="00:42:16.420" style="s2">whatever it is all of that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.999" end="00:42:18.999" style="s2">is fundamentally finite game and what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.420" end="00:42:21.009" style="s2">I suspect that were less we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.999" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">consciously driven by finite games but</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.009" end="00:42:26.709" style="s2">potentially propositional is that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:30.100" style="s2">would ruin by infinite game the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.709" end="00:42:32.860" style="s2">game which is a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.100" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">conscious its sub minimal as many people</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.860" end="00:42:40.500" style="s2">have talked about and what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">the crisis is naturally allowing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:46.650" style="s2">deeper agency of wanting and needing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:50.260" style="s2">play the infinite game of cooperation a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.650" end="00:42:54.310" style="s2">win-win cooperative games is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.260" end="00:42:56.980" style="s2">emerge so that was one question really</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.310" end="00:42:59.230" style="s2">is that I mean it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.980" end="00:43:01.180" style="s2">that we think we live in our heads and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.230" end="00:43:03.340" style="s2">it&#39;s the conscious mind but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.180" end="00:43:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a peanut in comparison with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.340" end="00:43:07.210" style="s2">really going on underneath so we have no</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.380" end="00:43:10.690" style="s2">choice from that point of view what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.210" end="00:43:13.000" style="s2">your thoughts on that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.690" end="00:43:15.490" style="s2">really that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.000" end="00:43:17.470" style="s2">observation because I think there&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.490" end="00:43:19.630" style="s2">thing you&#39;re talking about meaning was</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.470" end="00:43:22.660" style="s2">really tied to this concept there is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.630" end="00:43:24.610" style="s2">infinite amount of meaning to be had</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.660" end="00:43:26.020" style="s2">right it&#39;s sort of almost it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.610" end="00:43:28.660" style="s2">of like ties to Thomas Jefferson&#39;s thing</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.970" end="00:43:42.570" style="s2">tragic thing is that if we can get</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.870" style="s2">they&#39;re solving for sufficiency and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.220" end="00:43:51.460" style="s2">you realize there&#39;s better modes of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.870" end="00:43:54.520" style="s2">interaction to yield more and more</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.460" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">better things for everyone but if we</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.350" end="00:45:06.190" style="s2">we went from like an infinity of Usenet</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.570" end="00:45:08.110" style="s2">okay a lot of it was weird trash but</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.190" end="00:45:10.180" style="s2">still went from that to like oh everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.110" end="00:45:14.470" style="s2">visits the same 10 web sites right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.180" end="00:45:16.300" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this thing where if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.470" end="00:45:18.130" style="s2">don&#39;t up level the human organism if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.300" end="00:45:20.020" style="s2">don&#39;t create infrastructures by</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.130" end="00:45:21.850" style="s2">infrastructures I mean societies like</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.020" end="00:45:24.610" style="s2">this efforts like this you know things</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.850" end="00:45:26.470" style="s2">like this that help people to uplevel</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.610" end="00:45:28.210" style="s2">then we can be given the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.470" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">infrastructure technology and tools and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.210" end="00:45:31.300" style="s2">we will still create crappy finite games</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:32.470" style="s2">out of them it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.300" end="00:45:35.590" style="s2">mentioned college is one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.470" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">College should be a place well can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.590" end="00:45:38.110" style="s2">imagine the privilege of having a place</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.120" style="s2">where you just be fed and just read</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.110" end="00:45:41.530" style="s2">books right just talk to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.120" end="00:45:43.720" style="s2">smarter than you with wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.530" end="00:45:45.250" style="s2">equipment to do amazing experiments you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.720" end="00:45:45.820" style="s2">could just do that like wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.250" end="00:45:48.100" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.820" end="00:45:50.950" style="s2">but we turned it into a shitty finite</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.100" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">game of credential certification like</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.950" end="00:45:55.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s complete crap right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:57.910" style="s2">even given all of these things given the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:45:59.350" style="s2">multi billions of dollars that I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.910" end="00:46:00.940" style="s2">know plunk down into college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.350" end="00:46:02.770" style="s2">and everything in these buildings we</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.940" end="00:46:05.650" style="s2">still can&#39;t seem to get even in those</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.770" end="00:46:07.510" style="s2">most intellectual places this flip over</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.650" end="00:46:09.820" style="s2">into let&#39;s play an infinite game here</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.510" end="00:46:12.340" style="s2">right let&#39;s solve for how many students</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.820" end="00:46:14.350" style="s2">we can educate to a minimum level every</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.340" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">year and have that be the race versus</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.350" end="00:46:18.520" style="s2">how many Nobel Prize winners we have in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">our faculty why does someone race that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.520" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">way right how many you&#39;ll have the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:24.580" style="s2">extension education programs and oh by</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:26.110" style="s2">the way Harvard and stuff building</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.580" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">another 500 million dollar building</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.110" end="00:46:31.300" style="s2">somewhere in Massachusetts you can go</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">and literally educate and feed 20</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.300" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">villages somewhere in some third-world</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.930" style="s2">country like that would be much better</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.070" style="s2">that would literally be much better but</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.930" end="00:46:40.810" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t get you the credentials and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.070" end="00:46:42.490" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get you the Flair right so my</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.810" end="00:46:44.350" style="s2">point in all of this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.490" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">opportunity to live meaningful lives to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.350" end="00:46:48.340" style="s2">build societies that encourage people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">live meaningful and abundant lives is</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.340" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">all there that&#39;s why I think the game be</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.320" end="00:46:56.170" style="s2">sort of proto be movement is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.790" end="00:46:57.250" style="s2">pick up schemes scheme because people</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.170" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.250" end="00:47:01.299" style="s2">we could do this right this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.099" style="s2">we need to do because we could just keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.299" end="00:47:05.170" style="s2">running down the game a paths of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.099" end="00:47:07.510" style="s2">creating bigger and bigger and more and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.170" end="00:47:09.099" style="s2">more and worse of worse finite games but</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.510" end="00:47:13.059" style="s2">the other thing I&#39;ll say is that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.099" end="00:47:14.530" style="s2">game a thing and the finite games this</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.059" end="00:47:15.640" style="s2">actually does segue into the second</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.530" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">thing I was gonna talk about the phase</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.640" end="00:47:20.740" style="s2">two of what I was talked about which was</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:22.990" style="s2">Moloch and so on slay star codex is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.740" end="00:47:25.270" style="s2">brilliant exposition Scott Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.990" end="00:47:27.400" style="s2">about meditations of Moloch and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.270" end="00:47:28.630" style="s2">really is just as a reflection of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.400" end="00:47:30.039" style="s2">way the reason why things are the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.630" end="00:47:33.569" style="s2">they are is because we keep making them</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.039" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">the way they are and Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.569" end="00:47:39.160" style="s2">talks about this as a David and Goliath</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:40.829" style="s2">thing I have a medium blog post called</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.160" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">why do I capitalize the E in</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.829" end="00:47:44.500" style="s2">establishment and this is you know two</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:46.270" style="s2">and half years ago</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.500" end="00:47:47.740" style="s2">why capitalize the E in establishment</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.270" end="00:47:50.380" style="s2">because I was talking about being</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.740" end="00:47:52.420" style="s2">anti-establishment and the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.380" end="00:47:54.369" style="s2">that the system and the game of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.420" end="00:47:55.690" style="s2">world is actually just a game and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.369" end="00:47:57.910" style="s2">the other really interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.690" end="00:48:00.369" style="s2">Colonel Myers if everyone actually steps</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.910" end="00:48:03.130" style="s2">back and pauses and has to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.369" end="00:48:04.630" style="s2">intentional consequential decisions well</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.130" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">you start from a from a point of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.630" end="00:48:08.650" style="s2">sufficiency do I have food water</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.180" style="s2">utilities are my children safe or my</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.650" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">parents safe like that&#39;s where you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.180" end="00:48:14.859" style="s2">with and then you like well what do I</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.150" end="00:48:16.779" style="s2">need beyond that and now so basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.859" end="00:48:19.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you switch from one mode to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.779" end="00:48:21.849" style="s2">another then if everyone switches the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.630" end="00:48:23.230" style="s2">other mode there&#39;s no need for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.849" end="00:48:25.059" style="s2">previous mode it&#39;s not like there&#39;s men</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.230" end="00:48:26.470" style="s2">and back rooms like doing like this I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.059" end="00:48:28.660" style="s2">mean like oh we&#39;ll pull these levers and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.470" end="00:48:30.670" style="s2">like reprogram ever with five G that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.660" end="00:48:31.930" style="s2">not how it works right when we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.670" end="00:48:33.789" style="s2">emergent structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.930" end="00:48:36.220" style="s2">self-sustaining attractors as we call</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.789" end="00:48:37.900" style="s2">them right in mathematics and dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.220" end="00:48:39.609" style="s2">systems it&#39;s like if you if you ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.900" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">seen like a dust devil kind of swirling</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.609" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">across the desert at some point it runs</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.670" style="s2">out of steam it evaporates inside wanted</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:47.020" style="s2">to go the air is all still there the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.670" end="00:48:48.910" style="s2">dust particles also there they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.020" end="00:48:50.500" style="s2">of floating down it&#39;s all still there</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.910" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">but it just is a different configuration</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.500" end="00:48:55.059" style="s2">right and so what happens if you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.299" style="s2">the stigma jeddak you know you seem the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.059" end="00:49:00.250" style="s2">what they called the murmuration right</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.299" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">all these birds swarming in flying in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.250" end="00:49:03.400" style="s2">formation and stuff and every bird is</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.049" end="00:49:05.230" style="s2">making local decision well to the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.400" end="00:49:06.940" style="s2">birds and when you net that out it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.230" end="00:49:08.710" style="s2">becomes this irrigation that&#39;s swarms</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.940" end="00:49:11.079" style="s2">and has almost an organic life to itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.710" end="00:49:13.329" style="s2">but if you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.079" end="00:49:15.640" style="s2">freeze a blind Abby bird for like two</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.329" end="00:49:17.559" style="s2">seconds it was just boom instantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.640" end="00:49:19.029" style="s2">evaporate right because they would all</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.559" end="00:49:20.739" style="s2">make different or you&#39;ve seen those</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.029" end="00:49:22.599" style="s2">things when a big gust of wind comes if</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.739" end="00:49:23.829" style="s2">it comes from the same direction it hits</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.599" end="00:49:25.930" style="s2">all of them the whole thing actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.829" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">responds like a sail</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.930" end="00:49:29.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just absolutely fascinating watch</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:32.259" style="s2">these things human civilization is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.559" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">same thing right and so to to rise point</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.259" end="00:49:37.299" style="s2">about like climate change look we just</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.279" style="s2">totally solved climate change</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.299" end="00:49:40.779" style="s2">people just don&#39;t travel anymore all</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.279" end="00:49:42.069" style="s2">right you see like that now and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.779" end="00:49:43.269" style="s2">a say in India they can all the sudden</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.069" end="00:49:45.940" style="s2">see the Hemel ayahs again for the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.269" end="00:49:47.890" style="s2">time in decades right so when you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.940" end="00:49:49.809" style="s2">like we can all just be like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.890" end="00:49:51.339" style="s2">second do I really have to go that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.809" end="00:49:53.559" style="s2">business trip I didn&#39;t I was still able</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.339" end="00:49:55.089" style="s2">conduct business right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.559" end="00:49:57.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing that the system of the</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.309" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">keep doing it and all it takes and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.729" end="00:50:04.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned with coronavirus this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.779" style="s2">the the really interesting generalized</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.660" end="00:50:10.150" style="s2">point to take away from it is that a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.779" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">sufficiently large crisis of some</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.150" end="00:50:14.229" style="s2">duration a consequential choice imposed</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:15.489" style="s2">on everyone with a lag or a gap of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.229" end="00:50:18.219" style="s2">certain amount of time more than a day</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.489" end="00:50:20.650" style="s2">but probably less than a year you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.219" end="00:50:23.219" style="s2">two weeks seems to be enough with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.650" end="00:50:29.499" style="s2">you can burp you can hiccup you can</p>
