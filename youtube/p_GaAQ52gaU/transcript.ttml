<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:06.299" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.259" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the topic is because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:09.420" style="s2">have about five minutes to record this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:13.019" style="s2">before I have to go pick my kid up from</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.420" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">school and no time between that and my</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">bedtime to do it at any other point but</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">last night I discovered a stream yard</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">and I really liked it I used it once to</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">go live on periscope it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:29.240" style="s2">streaming app but I believe I can stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:32.369" style="s2">on YouTube Facebook and periscope</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.240" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">simultaneously which got my wheels</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.369" end="00:00:37.800" style="s2">turning last night laying in bed</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">supposed to be sleeping about creating</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">an idea I had a while ago of having an</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">hour booked for a I&#39;m gonna say staff</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">meeting that&#39;s not right like a Board of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:48.809" style="s2">Directors meeting where we move this</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">project forward together and the people</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.809" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">that show up to do that will become the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">board of directors and people who show</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">up consistently and once we have people</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">interested we&#39;re on video because I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">invite people and they can be on video</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">with me from their camera on this dream</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">yard which is also awesome because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">know that I can explain this much better</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">in a conversation in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">because I can see what doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">sense and read and explain that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:18.770" style="s2">it people ask questions and I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">respond to questions and so creating a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.770" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">meeting or we&#39;re publicly talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">how we&#39;re creating the global</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">cooperative whether it&#39;s with people</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:30.770" style="s2">with disabilities or not we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">the hope cafe and there I will stand for</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.770" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">creating it so that it&#39;s as the ablest</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">as possible the opposite as accessible</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">as possible and just that excited I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">excited to figure out this dreamer thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">and figure out it might be the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">I pay for but it&#39;s like 20 bucks a month</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">when you gets once it comes to the point</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">where I won&#39;t pay for that until I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">that I have hundred viewers regularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">and people are commenting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">interacting so that we can move forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">together in creating the technology that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.430" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">we need to do everything we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:07.630" style="s2">on this planet starting with what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">now calling the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.630" end="00:02:11.860" style="s2">Caffe instead of the hope cafe because</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">it has a different connotation when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.860" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">talking about working with people with</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:17.769" style="s2">disabilities than it does Fergie anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:20.890" style="s2">than it does when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.769" end="00:02:24.880" style="s2">global warming on the planet yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.890" end="00:02:26.140" style="s2">just it&#39;s a different connotation so and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.880" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.140" end="00:02:32.170" style="s2">is our ideas our thoughts and creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:34.120" style="s2">the space to have a global conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.170" end="00:02:36.099" style="s2">a real global conversation where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.120" end="00:02:37.930" style="s2">will be given people to talk to you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.099" end="00:02:40.060" style="s2">not need to be an expert just bring who</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:41.860" style="s2">you are and be part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.060" end="00:02:43.750" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna showcase that with us</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.860" end="00:02:45.010" style="s2">being on camera and having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.750" end="00:02:48.220" style="s2">with people that care about the issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.010" end="00:02:49.569" style="s2">and then moving forward with right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.220" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">how do we get even more people involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.569" end="00:02:56.680" style="s2">and that will be doing the idea cafe on</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.910" style="s2">Zoom and Facebook people joining in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.680" end="00:02:59.380" style="s2">saying when they&#39;re available and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.910" end="00:03:01.390" style="s2">setting up time periods within a week</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.380" end="00:03:03.459" style="s2">and then once we get even more people we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.390" end="00:03:06.160" style="s2">can possibly move to daily which is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.459" end="00:03:07.989" style="s2">the idea in cafe will be it&#39;ll be a new</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.160" end="00:03:10.329" style="s2">question every day that people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.989" end="00:03:12.100" style="s2">participate in or not participate in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.329" end="00:03:13.930" style="s2">people will be assigned people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:16.209" style="s2">to you and they can talk for one slot or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.930" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">no slots or as many slots as they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.209" end="00:03:20.260" style="s2">and the more slots you talk to the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">individual conversations you are having</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.260" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">and the more you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.150" style="s2">contribute to finding the thread that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:26.739" style="s2">runs through that but there&#39;ll only be</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.150" end="00:03:28.389" style="s2">some people who find the thread some</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.739" end="00:03:29.829" style="s2">people who experience different</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.389" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">conversations and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.829" end="00:03:33.670" style="s2">conversation they have on the next day</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">can be about what did you find in common</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.670" end="00:03:39.250" style="s2">and we can create ways to to what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">world cafe calls harvest those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.250" end="00:03:45.880" style="s2">find a way to visualize them and move</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:48.130" style="s2">forward with them when the world is able</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.880" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">to connect and have a conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.130" end="00:03:53.170" style="s2">real powerful conversation even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">nothing comes of that directly even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.170" end="00:03:57.160" style="s2">we&#39;d never create another thing that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:58.510" style="s2">and of itself is powerful enough because</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.160" end="00:04:00.730" style="s2">when we can see each other when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.510" end="00:04:04.420" style="s2">connect with each other it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.730" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">harder to other us to create false</p>
