<p begin="00:03:48.349" end="00:03:52.489" style="s2">that I won&#39;t go into details on but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.599" end="00:03:54.829" style="s2">funny thing about it was one night at</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.489" end="00:03:56.780" style="s2">home I get this phone call from a guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.829" end="00:03:58.910" style="s2">who I didn&#39;t know at all he introduced</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.780" end="00:04:01.069" style="s2">himself and he said you know I think it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.910" end="00:04:02.660" style="s2">is I had read our prospectus which had</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.069" end="00:04:05.090" style="s2">been published in some books in that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.660" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">and he said I think it&#39;s outrageous that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.090" end="00:04:08.269" style="s2">the university wants you to chart wants</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:11.510" style="s2">to charge you five thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.269" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">further one night&#39;s use and I explained</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.510" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">to him whether the university said</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:18.380" style="s2">nobody but nobody gets us for free and</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.120" end="00:04:25.970" style="s2">now and so we were prepared to raise the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.960" end="00:04:27.200" style="s2">money he said well I really like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.970" end="00:04:29.539" style="s2">you&#39;re doing I&#39;m prepared to give you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.200" end="00:04:31.039" style="s2">five thousand dollars to support it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.539" end="00:04:34.630" style="s2">I want you to go to the university</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.039" end="00:04:37.099" style="s2">president and say my name and then say</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.630" end="00:04:41.599" style="s2">he would give ten thousand dollars if</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.099" end="00:04:46.460" style="s2">the university agreed not to to charge</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.599" end="00:04:49.380" style="s2">us 5,000 for the so I phoned up the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.460" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2">of the university development</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.380" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">vice-president for that and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.310" end="00:04:57.460" style="s2">immediately said oh he&#39;s told you yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:58.150" style="s2">please come and see the president</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.460" end="00:05:00.280" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">and so I go and the president of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.280" end="00:05:07.150" style="s2">University of Michigan was a labor</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">negotiator and lawyer against not very</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.150" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">nice man but I walked into his office</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:12.789" style="s2">and I had this kind of sheepish grin on</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">his face that I knew before he opened</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.789" end="00:05:15.490" style="s2">his mouth that we&#39;d won and it turned</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:18.460" style="s2">out this is one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.490" end="00:05:21.699" style="s2">benefactors to the University and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.460" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">fact his his family-owned guy his wife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.699" end="00:05:27.190" style="s2">family owned a newspaper chain running</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">out of Chicago and apparently her mother</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.190" end="00:05:31.539" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to give any money away her</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.130" style="s2">father wanted to give money away so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.539" end="00:05:34.690" style="s2">instead they gave it to the kids who</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.130" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">gave it the good causes like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.690" end="00:05:38.710" style="s2">University of Michigan and so we got our</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">money but the funny thing about all</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.710" end="00:05:45.340" style="s2">those pins and that and also the Memphis</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.770" end="00:05:48.729" style="s2">pin those things that the funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.340" end="00:05:50.199" style="s2">about that was that the university put a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.729" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">condition that we could charge no more</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.199" end="00:05:55.509" style="s2">than fifty cents admission to this event</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:05:57.479" style="s2">so between selling the pins and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.509" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">50-cent admissions I was the financial</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.479" end="00:06:02.710" style="s2">finances chairman so every day I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:04.449" style="s2">go around campus and we have this great</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.710" end="00:06:06.039" style="s2">network of people that were selling pins</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.449" end="00:06:08.380" style="s2">and selling tickets for the event and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.039" end="00:06:09.490" style="s2">and I had a suitcase which I think we</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.380" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">still have her on a little silver</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.490" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">suitcase suitcase wasn&#39;t too big because</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:17.949" style="s2">it was filled with coins so every</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.240" style="s2">afternoon I would try and casually walk</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.949" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">across for fear of getting robbed</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.240" end="00:06:24.190" style="s2">because was city Detroit and I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:29.289" style="s2">trying to be casual on my arm was be</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.190" end="00:06:33.190" style="s2">good but there was a letter I just gave</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.289" end="00:06:35.409" style="s2">a talk last night at Pierson College on</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.190" end="00:06:37.090" style="s2">the west coast to PhD students from</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:57.159" style="s2">Jordan because in the oceans area we</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.240" end="00:06:59.289" style="s2">deal with leaders and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.159" end="00:07:01.990" style="s2">them and we deal with lots of laggards</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.289" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">who see the world in very narrow sorts</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.990" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">of ways and we also see the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:10.089" style="s2">who are the people in this room at you</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">and me because we can&#39;t all be experts</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.089" end="00:07:14.529" style="s2">in the oceans and I&#39;m not expert on all</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:16.750" style="s2">sorts of things I go out for frequent</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.529" end="00:07:19.270" style="s2">kayak writes and talks with a guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.750" end="00:07:20.949" style="s2">a physical oceanographer one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.270" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">in the field that lives in Victoria and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.949" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">and you know he gets into discussions</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:29.560" style="s2">with me that I have no idea what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:32.110" style="s2">talking about waves and things like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.560" end="00:07:34.930" style="s2">I just don&#39;t understand because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.110" end="00:07:37.750" style="s2">mathematical and it&#39;s always in so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.930" end="00:07:40.089" style="s2">all learners we&#39;re all people who want</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.750" end="00:07:41.469" style="s2">to do good but we have to deal with some</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.089" end="00:07:44.020" style="s2">people who really have very strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.469" end="00:07:45.669" style="s2">vested interests as well and who are to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.020" end="00:07:47.830" style="s2">be happy to take the last fish out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.669" end="00:07:51.669" style="s2">the sea if they could put it into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.830" end="00:07:54.729" style="s2">money from that into their pocket so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.669" end="00:07:57.130" style="s2">going to I thought first of all I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.729" end="00:08:00.849" style="s2">we should give Jordan an honorary</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.130" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">something in ocean studies not just of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.849" end="00:08:04.779" style="s2">the ocean sciences but ocean studies is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:07.260" style="s2">different and we do need psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.779" end="00:08:10.270" style="s2">and people with human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.260" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">understandings to bring the message out</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.270" end="00:08:14.199" style="s2">about the oceans it&#39;s been one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">problems scientists don&#39;t do a very good</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.199" end="00:08:18.370" style="s2">job even though they&#39;re very good</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:19.960" style="s2">scientists and some of them do</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.370" end="00:08:22.150" style="s2">fortunately and then there&#39;s people like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.960" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">Jack Cousteau and so forth many others</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">like that and organizations that really</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">try hard many of the big foundations</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:32.520" style="s2">raishin international a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">ocean oriented bodies and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.520" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s still not enough and it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.419" end="00:08:41.550" style="s2">be enough I think until people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:45.630" style="s2">actually have a lot of interest in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.550" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">oceans but what but still like feel they</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.630" end="00:08:51.959" style="s2">lacked the means to do things about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">and and I would include not the MPS in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.959" end="00:08:57.330" style="s2">that our members of parliament tend not</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:08:59.520" style="s2">to understand the oceans and some people</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.330" end="00:09:01.170" style="s2">say to me they turn to people some</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.520" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">people in some places in Canada turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:03.810" style="s2">their backs in the oceans they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.260" style="s2">interested in agriculture and the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.810" end="00:09:09.390" style="s2">that happened on land and and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.260" end="00:09:12.540" style="s2">strong feeling that people have that our</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.390" end="00:09:14.370" style="s2">parliamentarians have not risen to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.540" end="00:09:16.770" style="s2">challenge even though they&#39;ve cited the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.370" end="00:09:18.360" style="s2">government assigned those things and one</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.770" end="00:09:21.209" style="s2">of the things that differentiates us</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.360" end="00:09:23.339" style="s2">from Australia is that the Australians</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.209" end="00:09:25.980" style="s2">generally they all live in the coast is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.339" end="00:09:28.529" style="s2">one thing surf on a fish from it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.980" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">do everything near the water and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.529" end="00:09:34.649" style="s2">they actually have the strong political</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">will there&#39;s politicians there who have</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.649" end="00:09:39.660" style="s2">taken the oceans as a car and who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:41.520" style="s2">very powerful politicians that&#39;s helped</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.660" end="00:09:43.890" style="s2">a lot and I will come to that later in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.520" end="00:09:46.529" style="s2">the talk but I want to start off and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.890" end="00:09:48.329" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a lot to say I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.529" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">and set as concisely as I can and watch</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.329" end="00:09:54.930" style="s2">the clock so uh some time for discussion</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:57.390" style="s2">and I want to start generally looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.930" end="00:09:59.820" style="s2">the global situation and then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.390" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">home in on Canada because we as Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.820" end="00:10:04.520" style="s2">sitting here and and maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:06.899" style="s2">students who are not from Canada here</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.520" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">this is the country where you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.899" end="00:10:11.490" style="s2">to understand right now how we do things</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:13.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s very very important I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.490" end="00:10:14.820" style="s2">we&#39;re going to learn a lot from other</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.170" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">countries some of the Asian countries</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:18.779" style="s2">good and bad will learn that I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:20.279" style="s2">with have some very interesting models</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.779" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">for fisheries management China for</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">example they say they laugh at our</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.230" end="00:10:26.220" style="s2">fisheries models let me tell you they</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:28.529" style="s2">and then the LSE for example and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">say we haven&#39;t got the money or the time</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.529" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">to be able to debate the finer points of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">the models that you have what we do is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.870" end="00:10:37.140" style="s2">we just stop all fishing during the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:38.460" style="s2">spawning season for about two or three</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.140" end="00:10:42.600" style="s2">or four months I forgive</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.460" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">in the summertime oh and isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it perfectly but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">elements of that simple mechanism work</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:51.720" style="s2">for them maybe sometimes we need simpler</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:54.300" style="s2">things rather than the very involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.720" end="00:10:56.250" style="s2">debate that goes on between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.300" end="00:10:58.290" style="s2">scientists the fishery scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.250" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">tend to be all concerned about fishing</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.290" end="00:11:02.730" style="s2">and population dynamics people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:04.530" style="s2">myself that deal with ecosystems and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.730" end="00:11:07.290" style="s2">think about food chains and think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.530" end="00:11:09.630" style="s2">habitat destruction and so forth and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:11.100" style="s2">then others who take yet another point</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.630" end="00:11:13.790" style="s2">of view which is the fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:16.740" style="s2">economists who say get the price right</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.790" end="00:11:19.380" style="s2">individually transferable quotas and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.740" end="00:11:22.470" style="s2">sorts of exotica that I think are often</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.380" end="00:11:24.090" style="s2">useful but there is no simple answer so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be filling in the blanks</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.090" end="00:11:30.120" style="s2">here that Jordan has left me plenty to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:34.080" style="s2">fill in and and I&#39;m going to be focusing</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.120" end="00:11:36.750" style="s2">a lot on habitat a lot on the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.080" end="00:11:38.250" style="s2">because it&#39;s my belief that in addition</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.750" end="00:11:40.170" style="s2">to worrying about fishing you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.250" end="00:11:42.390" style="s2">worry about what&#39;s happening to where</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.170" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">fish live which is in the water feeding</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.390" end="00:11:47.400" style="s2">on things that in that marvelous food</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">chain that was described there and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.400" end="00:11:51.780" style="s2">indeed if we don&#39;t take that into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:54.300" style="s2">account in our decision-making about</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.780" end="00:11:56.820" style="s2">fisheries then we only know about a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.300" end="00:11:59.880" style="s2">quarter of what&#39;s really happening out</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.820" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">there so I just want to remind us first</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.880" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">of all that it&#39;s fair to say that our</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:09.300" style="s2">planet is above water and the water is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.430" end="00:12:12.570" style="s2">saltwater seventy percent of the earth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.300" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">surface is covered by it we depend on</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.570" end="00:12:16.680" style="s2">every single person in this planet</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.710" style="s2">whether or not they live in Afghanistan</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">whether they live in British Columbia</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.710" end="00:12:26.940" style="s2">Canada or Indonesia or any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:29.070" style="s2">places we depend on a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.940" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">ecological services from the oceans I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.070" end="00:12:33.060" style="s2">won&#39;t go into that right now but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:35.460" style="s2">very important to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.060" end="00:12:38.070" style="s2">secondly it is a history book of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.460" end="00:12:40.380" style="s2">earth we look at the sediments we know</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.070" end="00:12:43.050" style="s2">understand where we get our oxygen from</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.380" end="00:12:45.690" style="s2">and so forth and it&#39;s complex but we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.050" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">understand that and we also depend on</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.690" end="00:12:50.980" style="s2">that as we look for the resources we</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:54.190" style="s2">exploit where do we find out about</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.980" end="00:12:56.019" style="s2">how anchovies go up and down because of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.190" end="00:12:57.639" style="s2">El Nino and La Nina from the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.019" end="00:13:00.010" style="s2">sediments we look for the skills</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.639" end="00:13:03.750" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s an abuse there sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.010" end="00:13:06.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not there and in our hands</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.750" end="00:13:08.290" style="s2">sediments and so forth well all that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.519" end="00:13:10.870" style="s2">well we use is basically from</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.290" end="00:13:14.260" style="s2">phytoplankton from the sea and other sea</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.870" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">creatures so we have to do understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.260" end="00:13:19.029" style="s2">that it&#39;s the basis of natural wealth</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:20.889" style="s2">and of our prosperity half the people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.029" end="00:13:23.730" style="s2">the planet live close to the ocean and</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.730" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">their prosperity through trade through</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.070" end="00:13:32.170" style="s2">fishing through all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">things we know about so the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.170" end="00:13:37.510" style="s2">governments trade settlement patterns</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:39.699" style="s2">and it we now know and understand where</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.510" end="00:13:41.980" style="s2">they&#39;re clearly it also governs climate</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.699" end="00:13:43.930" style="s2">and therefore climate change but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.980" end="00:13:46.329" style="s2">also the source of conflict calamity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.930" end="00:13:49.750" style="s2">crises and I don&#39;t like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.329" end="00:13:50.380" style="s2">crises but I have to and particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">this talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.380" end="00:13:57.010" style="s2">people say the ocean is in crisis and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.899" style="s2">think it&#39;s true frankly despite all what</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.010" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">was said at the beginning of your talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.899" end="00:14:05.860" style="s2">Jordan and and I would like to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:07.540" style="s2">that things are nice out there on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.860" end="00:14:11.889" style="s2">environment globally they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.540" end="00:14:13.630" style="s2">downhill turn for sure but there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.889" end="00:14:15.699" style="s2">of looking at crisis that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.630" end="00:14:16.899" style="s2">very important and I again I go back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.699" end="00:14:19.480" style="s2">some of the experience because I spend a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.899" end="00:14:22.029" style="s2">lot of time in China China doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.480" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">to talk about barriers about not being</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.029" end="00:14:26.860" style="s2">able to do things and so forth what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.630" style="s2">cautioned me and say look talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.860" end="00:14:31.480" style="s2">crisis yes if you wish</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.630" end="00:14:34.209" style="s2">we understand we face crisis for a long</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.480" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">time we face crises how do you turn</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.209" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">crisis into opportunity and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">important Chinese do that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">crisis to opportunity and they actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:46.089" style="s2">do it often they&#39;re able to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:48.699" style="s2">crises and they&#39;re better off open new</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.089" end="00:14:52.870" style="s2">opportunities I talked about what I call</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.699" end="00:14:54.850" style="s2">c2s crisis to sustainability how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.870" end="00:14:55.270" style="s2">turn these things into a sustainable at</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.850" end="00:14:57.750" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.270" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">not easy but not impossible and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.750" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">particularly when I&#39;m talking with an</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.520" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">audience that includes people of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.810" style="s2">next generation we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.310" style="s2">solve all the messes and problems and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.810" end="00:15:12.730" style="s2">open the new opportunities that come</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.310" end="00:15:14.830" style="s2">with new technologies etc I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.730" end="00:15:19.390" style="s2">to leave you with a message of failure</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.830" end="00:15:22.390" style="s2">and a message of impossibility it has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.390" end="00:15:26.260" style="s2">be a message of opportunity and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.390" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">message of hope and so forth and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.260" end="00:15:29.770" style="s2">we can apply that to the ocean so some</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2">of the examples that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">present are things that seem to be going</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:36.700" style="s2">better now than they were say 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:39.760" style="s2">or 20 years ago so please keep that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.700" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">mind if it gets to christen just</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.760" end="00:15:45.790" style="s2">remember I&#39;m basically an optimist and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:48.700" style="s2">want to see hope for the future and hope</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.790" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">that the people who carry the burden</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.700" end="00:15:54.460" style="s2">forward and the institutions that I hope</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">Finn can become as if one of those can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.460" end="00:15:57.220" style="s2">make real contributions to that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:15:59.800" style="s2">looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.220" end="00:16:01.330" style="s2">you&#39;ve been my cat person over there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.800" end="00:16:03.010" style="s2">some of the others that I met earlier</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.110" end="00:16:19.840" style="s2">the country because we need we need this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.960" end="00:16:23.200" style="s2">kind of support and understanding and</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.200" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">I going further and further down the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:41.170" style="s2">food chain I feel that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:43.630" style="s2">working in a very intelligent way and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:45.889" style="s2">communicating with people that are still</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.630" end="00:16:49.569" style="s2">in high schools junior high schools</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.889" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">three schools so that they come into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.569" end="00:16:55.670" style="s2">university world with an attitude of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:58.790" style="s2">responsibility after they some extent</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.670" end="00:17:00.259" style="s2">but understanding particularly of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.790" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">where they can make a difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.259" end="00:17:05.689" style="s2">years ahead so those are some</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:07.819" style="s2">preliminary points okay so now we get</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.689" end="00:17:09.319" style="s2">into the nasty stuff ocean health and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.819" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">decline you&#39;re gonna hear these things</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.319" end="00:17:13.669" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a new index and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">given there&#39;s a lot of words in some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.669" end="00:17:18.649" style="s2">these slides don&#39;t even try and read</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:22.159" style="s2">them all listen to me but I&#39;m just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.649" end="00:17:23.389" style="s2">trying to take a videotape of this and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.159" end="00:17:25.130" style="s2">we&#39;re going to intersperse some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.389" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">slides so I want a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.130" end="00:17:28.970" style="s2">detail that&#39;s why I put it in here and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:31.490" style="s2">also ways that you can find this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.970" end="00:17:33.380" style="s2">information easily so there&#39;s this new</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.490" end="00:17:36.289" style="s2">thing that people have been trying for</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.380" end="00:17:38.510" style="s2">some time to get an integrated overview</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.289" end="00:17:41.210" style="s2">of ocean health and you can see it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.510" end="00:17:43.190" style="s2">very good overall in the world 60 out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.210" end="00:17:45.860" style="s2">a hundred and if you go on the website</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:47.299" style="s2">you can find with each country where</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.860" end="00:17:50.500" style="s2">it&#39;s good and not good interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.299" end="00:17:54.409" style="s2">Canada gets seventy out of a hundred so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">maybe we can trumpet success in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.409" end="00:18:00.230" style="s2">areas but I would say that certainly I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:02.769" style="s2">don&#39;t see things in great shape right</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.230" end="00:18:05.659" style="s2">now in Canada the same way that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.769" end="00:18:08.450" style="s2">announced as well and so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.179" end="00:18:45.750" style="s2">not a resolved issue I&#39;m kind of on</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.950" end="00:20:05.850" style="s2">should also add it&#39;s a hilarious working</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.050" end="00:20:08.160" style="s2">with us he goes up wearing a hockey</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.850" end="00:20:10.110" style="s2">helmet because there&#39;s two ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.160" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">get the seals you don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.110" end="00:20:14.010" style="s2">be the seal the seals gonna live but</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna have a few scars after he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.640" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">the the one way he likes to do it is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.980" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">quietly go up in your boat and you put</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">on your hockey helmet and then you run</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:30.180" style="s2">like hell into the water and onto the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:32.580" style="s2">shore and grab the seal they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.180" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">of a certain size of the standard ice if</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:35.539" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky you don&#39;t bash your head on</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.539" end="00:20:39.619" style="s2">with lots of algae the other way which</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.909" end="00:20:42.109" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want to do that also worked</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.619" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">is that the seal school in the water and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.109" end="00:20:48.739" style="s2">and then you he&#39;s got a thin nylon net</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:51.229" style="s2">out set out and the seals go into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.739" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">net they&#39;re startled and and he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.229" end="00:20:55.129" style="s2">get the one or two seals and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:56.629" style="s2">that no others are in there you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.129" end="00:20:58.999" style="s2">about five minutes before the steel</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.629" end="00:21:01.369" style="s2">start struggling and may be withdrawn so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.999" end="00:21:03.320" style="s2">but he&#39;s a very very good scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.369" end="00:21:06.859" style="s2">it pains me greatly he&#39;ll do fine</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.210" end="00:23:25.380" style="s2">this brings me to tears sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.910" end="00:23:28.890" style="s2">there&#39;s an area of the world called the</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:45.330" style="s2">first to live in Indonesia was the fact</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.370" end="00:23:58.920" style="s2">was six or seven species and the Coral</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s coming under control a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.300" end="00:24:24.120" style="s2">people go off and risk their lives to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:26.800" style="s2">have in the last decades risk their</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.120" end="00:24:30.340" style="s2">lives to go into all munitions dump</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.340" end="00:24:35.470" style="s2">to to take the explosives to take them</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.059" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">out of the shells and then go back and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.470" end="00:24:39.070" style="s2">blow up reefs with them</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:40.929" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen these reefs in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.070" end="00:24:45.010" style="s2">small islands for example in South</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.929" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">Sulawesi where where the the very lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.010" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">of people depend on the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:51.160" style="s2">reef because they protect the small</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:52.690" style="s2">islands around where people live and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.160" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">still people will come in from outside</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.690" end="00:24:56.980" style="s2">and blow up the reefs just to get the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:24:59.350" style="s2">fish done the fish take the fish goodbye</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.980" end="00:25:01.870" style="s2">go to another reef and the damage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.350" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">wreaked in that process is is quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.870" end="00:25:06.179" style="s2">incredible I&#39;ll come back to the Coral</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:09.040" style="s2">Triangle because the countries now</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.179" end="00:25:11.500" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s virgin that is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.040" end="00:25:13.690" style="s2">crisis situation and they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.500" end="00:25:16.300" style="s2">their best to do a number of things one</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.690" end="00:25:18.460" style="s2">of the one of the important points is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.300" end="00:25:20.650" style="s2">that they talk about a blue carbon</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.460" end="00:25:22.570" style="s2">budget in other words the reefs if</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.650" end="00:25:25.510" style="s2">they&#39;re properly managed and that will</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">extract a great deal of greenhouse gases</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.510" end="00:25:29.920" style="s2">as a consequence of the reef being there</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:32.470" style="s2">and more let&#39;s do it permanently so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.920" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">there&#39;s always good news and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.470" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">lots of bad news West Africa the fishing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">the term which I don&#39;t really like but</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a illegal unreported and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:51.150" style="s2">unsustainable as well but fishing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.160" end="00:25:53.770" style="s2">this is one of the prime areas that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.150" end="00:25:56.770" style="s2">bringing people in from the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.770" end="00:25:58.929" style="s2">countries and taking fish caught taking</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.770" end="00:26:01.030" style="s2">fish illegally and then these fish will</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.929" end="00:26:04.450" style="s2">be transported office as a Korean vessel</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.030" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">on the bottom sort of be transported to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.450" end="00:26:10.540" style="s2">Korea possibly through Europe and some</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">sold in the EU as well and the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.540" end="00:26:16.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a mother ship with illegal trawlers</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">that are out there and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.300" end="00:26:21.250" style="s2">spotting mechanisms where local</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.320" style="s2">populations because as was already said</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.250" end="00:26:25.390" style="s2">people now have access to equipment like</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.320" end="00:26:27.460" style="s2">this waterproof camera and this that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.390" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">the other access to the internet to know</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.460" end="00:26:32.710" style="s2">exactly which ship it is as fishing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:35.230" style="s2">people that go out in their canoes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.710" end="00:26:36.760" style="s2">take pictures and then report that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.230" end="00:26:37.620" style="s2">this is one of the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.760" end="00:26:40.200" style="s2">that technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.620" end="00:26:41.670" style="s2">can be very helpful in this process and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.200" end="00:26:43.980" style="s2">then finally I&#39;ve got a talk quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.670" end="00:26:45.330" style="s2">this evening about the Arctic changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.980" end="00:26:47.160" style="s2">environment and development pressures</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.330" end="00:26:48.990" style="s2">these are some photos I wish I had been</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.160" end="00:26:50.610" style="s2">in the nice position to be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.990" end="00:26:52.950" style="s2">that he&#39;s taken by Department of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.610" end="00:26:56.970" style="s2">Fisheries and Oceans staff but NAR</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.950" end="00:26:59.220" style="s2">whales and belugas coming up in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.970" end="00:27:00.840" style="s2">little areas that are open in the Arctic</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.220" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">well we know there&#39;s going to be lots</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.840" end="00:27:04.410" style="s2">more areas open in the future but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:07.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the fate of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.410" end="00:27:10.650" style="s2">animals will be now I did this diagram</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.800" end="00:27:13.620" style="s2">to try and understand the overall</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.650" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">governance of ocean use and I know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.620" end="00:27:17.330" style="s2">about that mainly because I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:19.170" style="s2">some very interesting lawyers and others</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.330" end="00:27:21.420" style="s2">people involved with fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.170" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">management and ocean management and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.420" end="00:27:27.900" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about all the details I I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:29.850" style="s2">did this diagram but the year 2000</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.900" end="00:27:33.030" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really changed much except that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.850" end="00:27:36.350" style="s2">now there&#39;s not just the 1992 Rio but as</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.030" end="00:27:40.700" style="s2">was pointed out we&#39;re up to 2012 Rio +20</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.350" end="00:27:43.230" style="s2">and the important point here is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.700" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">whatever we do with the oceans now</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.230" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just involve Canada doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:51.300" style="s2">involve a province in Canada it involves</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.370" style="s2">international management the use of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.300" end="00:27:55.710" style="s2">global consensus documents like the law</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.370" end="00:27:58.830" style="s2">of the sea it involves trade and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.710" end="00:27:59.970" style="s2">investment activities of various sorts</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.830" end="00:28:02.850" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to talk about some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.970" end="00:28:04.950" style="s2">these national and local interests which</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.850" end="00:28:07.290" style="s2">are often very vested interest and not</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.950" end="00:28:09.090" style="s2">in the best interest of the ocean but</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.290" end="00:28:09.240" style="s2">sometimes they are and are not listened</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.090" end="00:28:12.179" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.240" end="00:28:13.770" style="s2">and the generation of knowledge which</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.179" end="00:28:16.170" style="s2">comes not just as knowledge from</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.770" end="00:28:20.040" style="s2">scientists but it comes from people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.170" end="00:28:22.980" style="s2">have a flame in their belly like we</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.040" end="00:28:26.179" style="s2">heard in their last talk and people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.980" end="00:28:29.790" style="s2">are in Native communities First Nations</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.179" end="00:28:32.429" style="s2">community groups and many had many other</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.790" end="00:28:34.410" style="s2">interests so knowledge now is drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.429" end="00:28:37.500" style="s2">many places how do we put that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.410" end="00:28:40.210" style="s2">together and so we have things like very</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.500" end="00:28:42.010" style="s2">very very good thing called the global</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.210" end="00:28:44.440" style="s2">Oshin for him I don&#39;t have time to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.010" end="00:28:46.300" style="s2">into the but I suggest you take a look</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.440" end="00:28:48.610" style="s2">at it and this has become kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.300" end="00:28:51.250" style="s2">pressure group at the international</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.610" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">level and you can see don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.250" end="00:28:54.910" style="s2">all of them but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:57.870" style="s2">different areas and all these areas</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.910" end="00:29:00.810" style="s2">relate back to the fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:04.990" style="s2">aquatic resource management fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.810" end="00:29:06.550" style="s2">there&#39;s also a new yet another I hasten</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.990" end="00:29:09.160" style="s2">to add and I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.550" end="00:29:10.570" style="s2">going to be able to do global ocean</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.160" end="00:29:12.610" style="s2">commission that&#39;s been established</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.570" end="00:29:14.590" style="s2">launched just a few weeks ago with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.610" end="00:29:17.140" style="s2">focus on the high seas those areas of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.590" end="00:29:18.670" style="s2">the deep blue that Jordan correctly</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.140" end="00:29:20.470" style="s2">pointed out are not necessarily all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.670" end="00:29:23.320" style="s2">productive areas but they do play a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.470" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">major role still in our use of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.320" end="00:29:27.850" style="s2">oceans and one of the big questions is</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:31.060" style="s2">what who should how should</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.850" end="00:29:33.040" style="s2">high seas marine protected areas be set</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.060" end="00:29:36.130" style="s2">up and how should they be managed</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.040" end="00:29:39.160" style="s2">because all those neat things like open</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.130" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">tuna that go in a big circle around from</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.160" end="00:29:43.300" style="s2">the Gulf of Mexico up to the east coast</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:45.220" style="s2">of Canada across the West Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.300" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">then across it here and they face a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.220" end="00:29:50.200" style="s2">gauntlet of Fisheries boats a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:52.570" style="s2">number each of those fish is worth fifty</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.200" end="00:29:54.670" style="s2">thousand dollars one or two of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:56.860" style="s2">fish means the difference for a Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.670" end="00:30:00.190" style="s2">fisherman between a good year and a bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.860" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">year and so the incentive to keep fit to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.190" end="00:30:03.940" style="s2">have sustainability of the harvest but</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:05.470" style="s2">there&#39;s also Japanese and the high seas</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.940" end="00:30:07.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s people in the Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.470" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">side etc and there&#39;s a lot of some</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.720" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">illegal fishing</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:13.540" style="s2">so anyways Paul Martin&#39;s a Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:16.390" style="s2">member of this and I wish him luck but</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.540" end="00:30:19.810" style="s2">we frankly have had lots of very good</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.390" end="00:30:21.580" style="s2">advice from global ocean commissions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.810" end="00:30:23.650" style="s2">we haven&#39;t seen the uptake of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.580" end="00:30:27.040" style="s2">advice nearly as strongly as we should</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.650" end="00:30:31.030" style="s2">and that&#39;s a troubling matter so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.040" end="00:30:33.850" style="s2">entitled the talk not just for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.030" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">taking and and I really mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.850" end="00:30:39.250" style="s2">oceans are not just there for us to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:42.340" style="s2">we have to give we have to give a lot we</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.250" end="00:30:44.800" style="s2">have to give our best to make the uses</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.340" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">of the ocean sustainable we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.800" end="00:30:47.960" style="s2">understand that other creatures on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:52.010" style="s2">planet have</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.960" end="00:30:54.620" style="s2">a strong rationale for being included in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.010" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">the list of voters of the ocean the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.620" end="00:31:00.710" style="s2">people the creatures that have some take</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.380" end="00:31:03.890" style="s2">on that massive set of resources out</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.710" end="00:31:05.710" style="s2">there so but for us we at least can talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.890" end="00:31:10.070" style="s2">back and forth as humans to each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.710" end="00:31:12.140" style="s2">and we have to devise what I&#39;d call a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.070" end="00:31:14.660" style="s2">responsible care approach for Canada&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.140" end="00:31:16.310" style="s2">okay and so I&#39;m going to go through some</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.660" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">of what I consider the elements of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.310" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">to be including some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:23.900" style="s2">directly relate to fisheries first</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">question this comes from John Fraser who</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.900" end="00:31:28.940" style="s2">I think a lot of former Minister of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:33.560" style="s2">Fisheries and Oceans Canada lives in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.940" end="00:31:36.050" style="s2">west coast and he talks as a person who</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.560" end="00:31:37.610" style="s2">is totally and absolutely committed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.050" end="00:31:40.190" style="s2">the health and the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.610" end="00:31:42.440" style="s2">oceans and says who speaks for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.190" end="00:31:45.560" style="s2">oceans and what are they doing about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.440" end="00:31:47.510" style="s2">and I think that for your group fin you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.560" end="00:31:49.550" style="s2">should ask that question you should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.510" end="00:31:51.410" style="s2">one of the group&#39;s that&#39;s speaking for</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.550" end="00:31:54.170" style="s2">the oceans but what are you going to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.410" end="00:31:56.180" style="s2">about it what is it that you can do to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.170" end="00:31:57.710" style="s2">make a difference and that question</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.180" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">should be first and foremost in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.710" end="00:32:04.250" style="s2">mind here&#39;s a couple of Canadian authors</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:06.790" style="s2">to add to the very good list and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.250" end="00:32:09.650" style="s2">was a short list by the way that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.790" end="00:32:11.990" style="s2">mentioned there&#39;s lots of others but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:14.690" style="s2">book seasick written by Alana Mitchell</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.990" end="00:32:16.280" style="s2">former a global male writer she put a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.690" end="00:32:18.560" style="s2">couple of years of her life into writing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.280" end="00:32:20.890" style="s2">this book and it&#39;s very very good</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.560" end="00:32:24.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s been highly acclaimed in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.890" end="00:32:26.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s based on science but she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.860" end="00:32:27.650" style="s2">a scientist be the first to say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.180" end="00:32:30.110" style="s2">she&#39;s a journalist trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.650" end="00:32:32.710" style="s2">things about the oceans and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.110" end="00:32:34.160" style="s2">from her title of what her conclusion is</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.170" end="00:32:43.220" style="s2">more detail about the things that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:45.539" style="s2">was talking about about this an ending</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.220" end="00:32:48.840" style="s2">slaughter of creatures from the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.539" end="00:32:51.629" style="s2">over the last 500 years in Canada I once</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.840" end="00:32:53.909" style="s2">showed a film about CEO slaughter at</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.629" end="00:32:56.220" style="s2">Dalhousie University and the graduate</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.909" end="00:32:57.809" style="s2">students that asked me to stop it in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.220" end="00:33:00.450" style="s2">middle and they said we can&#39;t take any</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.809" end="00:33:02.519" style="s2">more if this is what the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:04.200" style="s2">why are you spending your time on this</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.519" end="00:33:07.019" style="s2">why don&#39;t you just give up and drive do</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.200" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">something simpler that&#39;s not the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.019" end="00:33:12.239" style="s2">constructed I guess but but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:14.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not pleasant reading but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.239" end="00:33:17.429" style="s2">reality check about what we have done in</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:34.700" style="s2">in this field he sorted out how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.260" end="00:35:37.570" style="s2">reduce the damage from the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.700" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">between fishermen and whales in</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:46.250" style="s2">fame of many more things since then but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.550" end="00:35:48.830" style="s2">he learned how using basic behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:50.660" style="s2">things that involve both the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.830" end="00:35:52.310" style="s2">the whales and the behavior of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.660" end="00:35:54.680" style="s2">fisherman so that when whales got which</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.310" end="00:35:56.630" style="s2">is very frequent which when whales got</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.680" end="00:36:00.140" style="s2">caught in the fishermen&#39;s traps for cod</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:36:02.510" style="s2">traps they and these are big whales</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.140" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">really big whales and everybody got</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.510" end="00:36:06.830" style="s2">upset the whales got upset enough and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:08.360" style="s2">died fishermen put themselves in danger</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.830" end="00:36:10.610" style="s2">but lost a great deal of money and who</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.360" end="00:36:12.500" style="s2">wants to kill a whale so anyways he</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.610" end="00:36:15.230" style="s2">worked that out and had teams that could</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.500" end="00:36:17.960" style="s2">actually go ahead and do it so but he</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.230" end="00:36:19.850" style="s2">did many more things and and these are</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.960" end="00:36:22.690" style="s2">people who made a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.850" end="00:36:25.970" style="s2">contribution in their lifetimes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.690" end="00:36:29.480" style="s2">serve as an inspiration for me and for</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.970" end="00:36:32.330" style="s2">many others getting down and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.480" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">just suggesting maybe if you&#39;re serious</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.330" end="00:36:36.740" style="s2">about wanting to understand what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:38.870" style="s2">should be asking his research questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.740" end="00:36:43.220" style="s2">here&#39;s what some of the radiation</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.870" end="00:36:45.320" style="s2">scientists in Canada are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.220" end="00:36:47.900" style="s2">and they bring it they bring in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.320" end="00:36:49.910" style="s2">four areas yes brain and prove the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.900" end="00:36:51.020" style="s2">fundamental scientific understanding but</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.910" end="00:36:53.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.020" end="00:36:55.580" style="s2">information about monitoring and how you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.300" end="00:36:57.590" style="s2">use that information and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.580" end="00:36:59.660" style="s2">look at really understanding the impacts</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.590" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">of human activities and then you got to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.660" end="00:37:03.110" style="s2">bring this information back into</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:05.990" style="s2">governance and management so it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.110" end="00:37:09.770" style="s2">just about managing a specific fish</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.990" end="00:37:12.230" style="s2">stock we&#39;ve gone beyond that now because</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.770" end="00:37:14.330" style="s2">when you try and do it we find often</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.230" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.330" end="00:37:19.670" style="s2">big questions that that are ignored in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:22.790" style="s2">that approach this is a rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.670" end="00:37:25.640" style="s2">interesting new document that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.790" end="00:37:27.530" style="s2">come out but it gets to that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.640" end="00:37:30.020" style="s2">going to try and say in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.530" end="00:37:32.360" style="s2">things today there&#39;s other people that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.020" end="00:37:33.500" style="s2">so there&#39;s this the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.360" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">speaks for sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.500" end="00:37:38.870" style="s2">then there&#39;s all these folks sea paws</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.830" end="00:38:23.900" style="s2">it could be as high as 70% of the land</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.600" end="00:38:26.170" style="s2">area so that&#39;s that&#39;s an important</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.810" end="00:38:44.900" style="s2">have to have it for since 1977 we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.870" end="00:38:47.240" style="s2">do much better much more value from our</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.440" end="00:39:33.860" style="s2">up from Inuvik</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.750" end="00:39:39.560" style="s2">hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk which is important</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.330" end="00:39:41.870" style="s2">strategically for a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.560" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">and the last 40 kilometers you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.750" end="00:39:56.120" style="s2">be 300 million dollars and of course one</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.230" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">of the reasons for that is simply that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.120" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">they won&#39;t be able to use ice highways</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.370" style="s2">up there much longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:05.120" style="s2">this becomes a season becomes too short</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.120" end="00:40:11.840" style="s2">did a lot of mentoring with Janelle</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.880" end="00:40:14.990" style="s2">Kennedy on the eastern Arctic where of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.840" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">course this is a prime area for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.990" end="00:40:19.880" style="s2">going to happen in the future with</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:22.330" style="s2">icebergs and so forth but also one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.880" end="00:40:24.350" style="s2">the most interesting areas because we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.330" end="00:40:26.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know very much about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.350" end="00:40:29.800" style="s2">continental shelf in that area some</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.360" end="00:40:33.039" style="s2">people say it&#39;s better known on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.800" end="00:40:35.769" style="s2">surface of the Moon than it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.039" end="00:40:36.999" style="s2">in that area people are already looking</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.769" end="00:40:40.289" style="s2">at it though for oil and gas</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.999" end="00:40:43.709" style="s2">exploitation for shipping purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.289" end="00:40:45.910" style="s2">they&#39;re also looking for fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.709" end="00:40:47.349" style="s2">surprising how many things are happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.910" end="00:40:49.059" style="s2">in the Arctic right now where people</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.349" end="00:40:50.919" style="s2">want to go up and test fish on the East</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.059" end="00:40:53.169" style="s2">Coast it&#39;s for things like cod and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.919" end="00:40:56.349" style="s2">West Coast is already salmon moving</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.169" end="00:40:59.669" style="s2">around into all of this Pacific salmon</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.349" end="00:41:03.549" style="s2">are now found in in some Arctic rivers</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.669" end="00:41:05.499" style="s2">to the other coast I Gandharan that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.549" end="00:41:08.619" style="s2">was in a very small airplane with John</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.499" end="00:41:11.439" style="s2">lean the person the will man Gander and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.619" end="00:41:15.549" style="s2">Fogo Island all covered in ice at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.439" end="00:41:17.559" style="s2">point and then to a place where I really</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.549" end="00:41:20.949" style="s2">enjoy being which is Lunenburg Nova</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.559" end="00:41:23.949" style="s2">Scotia one of the great shipping wooden</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.949" end="00:41:26.199" style="s2">shipbuilding and so forth places and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.949" end="00:41:31.089" style="s2">happened to be there the day they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.199" end="00:41:32.109" style="s2">relaunching the Bluenose to almost and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.089" end="00:41:33.969" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of interesting if you look</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.109" end="00:41:35.679" style="s2">along that shoreline there&#39;s the sea</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.969" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">shepherd I would know the sea Shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.679" end="00:41:41.380" style="s2">Paul Watson&#39;s boat which has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">impounded by Canada for reasons that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.380" end="00:41:45.849" style="s2">won&#39;t explain right now and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:47.469" style="s2">see these other large boats and you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.849" end="00:41:50.259" style="s2">see the Dartmouth ferry and a small</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.469" end="00:41:52.479" style="s2">naval vessel to drydock there as well it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.259" end="00:41:55.859" style="s2">really is an active little spot but</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.479" end="00:41:59.349" style="s2">don&#39;t forget that the oceans influence</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.859" end="00:42:03.999" style="s2">extends to Ontario not only directly</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.349" end="00:42:06.279" style="s2">through the region and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.999" end="00:42:08.349" style="s2">therefore Quebec but also the water</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.279" end="00:42:11.079" style="s2">comes out of Ontario the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.349" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">water and so forth creatures from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.079" end="00:42:17.890" style="s2">ocean come up into the Great Lakes</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:19.299" style="s2">including those L wives and some other</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.890" end="00:42:21.710" style="s2">little things that are really nasty and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.299" end="00:42:27.240" style="s2">cost us billions of dollars and manage</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.710" end="00:42:29.310" style="s2">these species but it&#39;s also officially</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.240" end="00:42:31.380" style="s2">considered in Canada that these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.310" end="00:42:34.080" style="s2">inland seas that deserve to fall under</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.380" end="00:42:36.210" style="s2">the purview of Fisheries and Oceans for</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.080" end="00:42:38.940" style="s2">some things and then we think of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.210" end="00:42:41.370" style="s2">Gulf of st. Lawrence now it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.940" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">interesting body of water there but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.370" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">I&#39;d like you to look at is those little</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">circles and then I&#39;m going to show you</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:49.860" style="s2">some more circles one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:53.100" style="s2">interesting things for me of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.860" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">simplify my understanding a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.100" end="00:42:57.450" style="s2">oceanography is to look at the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:42:59.850" style="s2">that go round and round and gyres and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.450" end="00:43:01.620" style="s2">circles one sort of another the simple</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.850" end="00:43:03.420" style="s2">example is when you go sea kayaking and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.620" end="00:43:05.100" style="s2">you&#39;re out there straining against the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.420" end="00:43:06.600" style="s2">current and so forth maybe the tides</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.100" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">against in there&#39;s a strong current</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.600" end="00:43:11.010" style="s2">maybe a wind blowing against it so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">go into shore and then you find a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.010" end="00:43:15.540" style="s2">counter-current and then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:16.920" style="s2">swept along because that counter current</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.540" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">is going this way while the main</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.920" end="00:43:21.810" style="s2">currents go in that way so you get a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">free ride instead of being outed so lots</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.810" end="00:43:25.530" style="s2">of other things get free ride so if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:27.450" style="s2">look at what&#39;s called the Haida Eddie</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.530" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">here you see these little swirls out and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.450" end="00:43:32.100" style="s2">they going out into the ocean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:33.810" style="s2">well they&#39;re driven by the fresh water</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.100" end="00:43:35.490" style="s2">which is all that red stuff coming down</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.810" end="00:43:39.530" style="s2">from the rivers like the skeino River</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.490" end="00:43:42.120" style="s2">and some others and and those swirls are</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.530" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2">driven by the current patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.120" end="00:43:48.030" style="s2">ocean and they go out and they transport</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:51.060" style="s2">all the larvae from the inshore and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.030" end="00:43:55.230" style="s2">nutrients out to the offshore so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.060" end="00:43:57.750" style="s2">talked Jordan about the sea moans and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.230" end="00:44:05.430" style="s2">one of these now boy ciment is just out</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.750" end="00:44:08.940" style="s2">there near the top end of it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.430" end="00:44:10.620" style="s2">how it gets all the fish that that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.940" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">out there that make it very special and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.620" end="00:44:15.150" style="s2">why it&#39;s a high productivity area</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:18.330" style="s2">another one is in the Beaufort gyre up</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.150" end="00:44:20.700" style="s2">in the Arctic and that&#39;s a collection</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.330" end="00:44:21.290" style="s2">point for the whales in the Arctic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.700" end="00:44:23.390" style="s2">some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.290" end="00:44:25.610" style="s2">the fish species as well because of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.390" end="00:44:28.280" style="s2">high productivity same in the Gulf</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.610" end="00:44:31.070" style="s2">Stream and here&#39;s a good example of how</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.280" end="00:44:32.870" style="s2">little we understand for a long time the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.070" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">oceanographers didn&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.870" end="00:44:36.890" style="s2">there were these gyres in in that area</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">of the Gulf Stream</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.890" end="00:44:40.100" style="s2">so the Gulf Stream is going off coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">up the coast of the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.100" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">heading off to Europe then there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:44.810" style="s2">these counter cards that are swirling</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">around just like the ones I&#39;d be looking</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.810" end="00:44:48.740" style="s2">for on a kayak and their warm water</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:53.330" style="s2">they&#39;re getting warm water in off the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.740" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">ocean so if these counter currents</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.330" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">happen to be in place just at the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">that the scallops which are down on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:04.340" style="s2">Georges Bank shelf are spawning then the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.750" style="s2">little creatures coming up gets swept</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.340" end="00:45:08.630" style="s2">away by the warm water because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.750" end="00:45:11.030" style="s2">cold water creatures and and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.630" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">get a good spawn that year so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.030" end="00:45:13.490" style="s2">going to try and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">management of things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.490" end="00:45:19.730" style="s2">understand phenomena like the the gyres</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:22.190" style="s2">and the eddies in the oceans and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.730" end="00:45:25.090" style="s2">this is my first introduction here</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.190" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">thanks ecological physically geological</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.090" end="00:45:30.320" style="s2">phenomena that that won&#39;t come out</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.820" style="s2">through an examination of studying</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.320" end="00:45:33.890" style="s2">fishing pressure because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.820" end="00:45:35.360" style="s2">environmental and focus and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.890" end="00:45:39.140" style="s2">of those kinds of things in the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.360" end="00:45:40.970" style="s2">so this has led to great tough you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.140" end="00:45:43.340" style="s2">believe there&#39;s just like among</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.970" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">economists they know what&#39;s the saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:47.930" style="s2">that if you get three economists in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:49.970" style="s2">room you&#39;ll get four opinions you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.930" end="00:45:51.590" style="s2">or something like that and was famous</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.970" end="00:45:54.320" style="s2">true with fisheries biologists I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.100" end="00:46:20.060" style="s2">by the way we were talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:21.860" style="s2">the phone rings just at that moment from</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">case there was a whole very large</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.450" end="00:46:51.750" style="s2">ecosystem group and they were shut down</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:54.760" style="s2">they were shut down by the higher-ups</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.750" end="00:46:56.680" style="s2">because they were producing data that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.760" end="00:46:58.750" style="s2">were at odds with what the population</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.680" end="00:47:00.220" style="s2">dynamics people were producing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.750" end="00:47:03.369" style="s2">giving a simplified version of things</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.220" end="00:47:04.590" style="s2">but so the point is and I used to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.369" end="00:47:07.890" style="s2">this to students when I was teaching</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.590" end="00:47:10.600" style="s2">fisheries things and in Nova Scotia</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.890" end="00:47:12.940" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the experts you know form</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.600" end="00:47:15.369" style="s2">your own opinions the experts are often</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.940" end="00:47:17.860" style="s2">very wrong and they wear blinders just</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.369" end="00:47:20.020" style="s2">like everybody else in society and one</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.860" end="00:47:22.330" style="s2">of the biggest ones is about fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.020" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">management the same could be said at</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.330" end="00:47:26.410" style="s2">times in the past for forest management</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:29.230" style="s2">but fisheries management is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.410" end="00:47:32.290" style="s2">even more complex at least trees stand</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.230" end="00:47:35.619" style="s2">in line and can be counted rarely is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.290" end="00:47:37.720" style="s2">that the case with fish because of what</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.619" end="00:47:40.210" style="s2">occurs among other things so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.720" end="00:47:43.150" style="s2">here&#39;s just a little collection of books</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.210" end="00:47:45.310" style="s2">and I could triple that collection about</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.150" end="00:47:47.619" style="s2">these different points of view and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.310" end="00:47:50.380" style="s2">won&#39;t go into details now this is a sad</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.619" end="00:47:52.900" style="s2">story here this is in Lunenburg Nova</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.380" end="00:47:54.580" style="s2">Scotia and how many have ever been to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.900" end="00:47:57.460" style="s2">Lunenburg how many ever been to Nova</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.580" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">Scotia great great well to go down to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.460" end="00:48:05.109" style="s2">Lunenburg you&#39;ll see it it&#39;s very moving</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:07.300" style="s2">very very moving instead of what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.109" end="00:48:10.510" style="s2">you call these obelisks maybe I guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.300" end="00:48:13.240" style="s2">and and they list as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.510" end="00:48:16.119" style="s2">the names of people who were killed at</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.240" end="00:48:17.560" style="s2">sea in some cases there might be they</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.119" end="00:48:19.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have all the names because it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.560" end="00:48:22.300" style="s2">would be 50 or 100 people who were</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.270" end="00:48:23.360" style="s2">killed in 1927 and again and while we</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.300" end="00:48:25.610" style="s2">were living there there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.360" end="00:48:27.500" style="s2">incident but these are just people from</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.610" end="00:48:31.100" style="s2">Lunenburg area because this was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.500" end="00:48:34.100" style="s2">Grand Banks fisheries and and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.100" end="00:48:36.200" style="s2">moving to see it but the point is we</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.100" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">remember a lot about erosion past and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.200" end="00:48:41.060" style="s2">even tend to glorify it or feel sad</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:42.580" style="s2">about it or whatever but what have we</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.060" end="00:48:45.080" style="s2">actually learned you know and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.580" end="00:48:46.910" style="s2">just for a little window-dressing there</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.080" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a couple of postage stamps to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.910" end="00:48:52.790" style="s2">remind us about the glorious past and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:55.070" style="s2">that&#39;s the fellow on the right Angus</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.790" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">Walters was a very famous captain of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.070" end="00:48:59.120" style="s2">fastest of the day ships the Bluenose</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:01.970" style="s2">Newfoundland</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.120" end="00:49:03.560" style="s2">that&#39;s that abundant Cod population but</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.970" end="00:49:07.460" style="s2">the interesting thing is the men that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.560" end="00:49:10.670" style="s2">told us early on stuff that is still</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.460" end="00:49:12.860" style="s2">being quoted is Harold Ennis from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.670" end="00:49:15.290" style="s2">University of Toronto who was an</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.860" end="00:49:18.170" style="s2">economist who dealt with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.290" end="00:49:20.210" style="s2">Heartland and hinterland in Canada and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.170" end="00:49:23.990" style="s2">the fact is that we were heroes of wood</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.210" end="00:49:27.230" style="s2">drawers of water fur traders but also we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.990" end="00:49:31.340" style="s2">dipped into the ocean and he wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.230" end="00:49:33.860" style="s2">what happens when you get a really truly</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.340" end="00:49:37.540" style="s2">abundant resource like the cod fishery</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.860" end="00:49:41.600" style="s2">said so that&#39;s his book written in 1940</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.540" end="00:49:45.710" style="s2">very prescient and basically he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.600" end="00:49:48.440" style="s2">is an abundant tradable resource can</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.710" end="00:49:51.260" style="s2">fuel an economy but it also traps you in</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.440" end="00:49:53.030" style="s2">many ways and and that is what has</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.260" end="00:49:55.790" style="s2">happened in Canada in a sense we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.030" end="00:49:58.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve relied on super abundant natural</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.790" end="00:50:00.740" style="s2">resources not just fish but but it</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.850" end="00:50:02.060" style="s2">allows us I&#39;ve thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.740" end="00:50:04.370" style="s2">over the years trying to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.060" end="00:50:06.680" style="s2">would behave towards the resources we do</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.370" end="00:50:08.210" style="s2">like for example with a card when we</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.680" end="00:50:12.080" style="s2">lived in Nova Scotia you know we can go</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.210" end="00:50:14.060" style="s2">in and buy this fish that was awful in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.080" end="00:50:16.370" style="s2">the stores you couldn&#39;t get good caught</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.060" end="00:50:18.200" style="s2">in the stores and the reason it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.370" end="00:50:20.330" style="s2">good it was because it was mishandled</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.200" end="00:50:22.940" style="s2">right from the time it was it was nice</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.330" end="00:50:26.600" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t bled so you&#39;d have a nice open</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.940" end="00:50:28.820" style="s2">flesh and it was treated as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.600" end="00:50:30.950" style="s2">going after the car house to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.820" end="00:50:34.370" style="s2">as salted cod you know low value</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.950" end="00:50:36.170" style="s2">commodity some other people Iceland</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.370" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">Norwegians and some others didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.170" end="00:50:40.100" style="s2">that they treated the fish property they</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:42.830" style="s2">got a very good value at it and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.100" end="00:50:45.710" style="s2">started respecting the resorts base even</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.830" end="00:50:48.500" style="s2">more so that&#39;s the important thing for</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.710" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">those with an economic bent to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.500" end="00:50:53.630" style="s2">is that you can one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:55.820" style="s2">ways in which we can actually get more</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.630" end="00:50:58.940" style="s2">out of our resource get is to add value</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.820" end="00:51:02.090" style="s2">to it handle it carefully respect each</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.940" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">fish that we catch which gets again into</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.090" end="00:51:06.230" style="s2">why is it that we can go in and use</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:08.840" style="s2">trawlers and you know take a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.230" end="00:51:10.280" style="s2">fraction of the fish but anyways a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.840" end="00:51:12.680" style="s2">of the stuff goes back to Harold Ennis</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.280" end="00:51:15.620" style="s2">and now the other thing is and I hear I</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.680" end="00:51:17.930" style="s2">differ a bit from what what was said</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.620" end="00:51:19.640" style="s2">about the empty oceans yes the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.930" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">are empty because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve knocked</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.640" end="00:51:24.320" style="s2">out a lot of the food chain but there</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:26.630" style="s2">still can be in abundance and as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.320" end="00:51:29.390" style="s2">correctly pointed out Jordan if you like</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.630" end="00:51:33.590" style="s2">eating jellyfish which I actually I do</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.390" end="00:51:36.380" style="s2">there but I keep asking my Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.590" end="00:51:39.230" style="s2">colleagues well why is it that you eat</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.380" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">you know chicken feet or certain other</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.230" end="00:51:42.770" style="s2">things look a bit assemble that certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.990" style="s2">other things well it isn&#39;t for the taste</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.770" end="00:51:47.390" style="s2">particularly it&#39;s for the crunch crunch</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.990" end="00:51:49.790" style="s2">better and and jellyfish is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.390" end="00:51:51.590" style="s2">things and the same with Indonesian sand</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.790" end="00:51:52.310" style="s2">others they like the crunch and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.590" end="00:51:54.140" style="s2">delicious</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.310" end="00:51:55.400" style="s2">now they&#39;re dried in Newfoundland</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.140" end="00:51:56.600" style="s2">Newfoundland couldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.400" end="00:51:58.190" style="s2">luck when they discovered them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.600" end="00:52:01.730" style="s2">actually people in the world that wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.190" end="00:52:03.050" style="s2">to eat jellyfish but they so they start</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.730" end="00:52:04.790" style="s2">drying them and exporting them into</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.050" end="00:52:06.770" style="s2">these little flat patties you know but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.790" end="00:52:09.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s certain other things that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.770" end="00:52:11.000" style="s2">could mention as well and squid of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.080" end="00:52:15.560" style="s2">course it&#39;s one of them and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.000" end="00:52:17.750" style="s2">find is an ocean that gets very abundant</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.560" end="00:52:19.670" style="s2">in those creatures that can be low on</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.750" end="00:52:21.320" style="s2">the food chain often and what we call</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.670" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">detritus food change you know the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.320" end="00:52:26.030" style="s2">that rains down into the water column</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:28.580" style="s2">and so lots of fishermen are now happy</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.030" end="00:52:30.040" style="s2">to see no Cod and Nova in well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.580" end="00:52:33.080" style="s2">know about Nova Scotia so much but</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.040" end="00:52:35.810" style="s2">certainly whoops everything shut up</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.080" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">I guess if you got up there still oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.810" end="00:52:41.900" style="s2">yeah can I have some technical help up</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:46.580" style="s2">here like I&#39;ve got nothing on my screen</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.900" end="00:52:50.930" style="s2">and you like to see my screen oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.580" end="00:52:55.310" style="s2">okay Justin okay and then how do I get</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.930" end="00:52:57.470" style="s2">it to go back you&#39;re just okay so so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.310" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">now have very very valuable snow crowd</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.470" end="00:53:02.510" style="s2">and northern shrimp and basically the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:04.820" style="s2">ecosystem has changed don&#39;t expect the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.510" end="00:53:06.320" style="s2">car to come back unless something</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.820" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">catastrophic happens to these guys</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.320" end="00:53:11.630" style="s2">because these are per place basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:13.490" style="s2">replaced the card will see card for sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.630" end="00:53:14.930" style="s2">we&#39;ll see some other ground fish we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.490" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">probably won&#39;t see them in the abundance</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.930" end="00:53:19.310" style="s2">because these guys are eating that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">the food chain now so but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.310" end="00:53:24.530" style="s2">necessarily a bad thing that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">fewer card if you ask the fisherman a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.530" end="00:53:27.950" style="s2">lot of them that have made it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:29.360" style="s2">money off these new species will say hey</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.950" end="00:53:32.210" style="s2">we&#39;re making more money that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.360" end="00:53:34.190" style="s2">better bullets etc the question is and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.210" end="00:53:35.890" style="s2">tried to look at this question with some</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.190" end="00:53:39.140" style="s2">people in the Auditor General&#39;s Office</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.890" end="00:53:41.510" style="s2">some years ago and we concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.140" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">there was no knowledge base to support</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.510" end="00:53:45.950" style="s2">the hypothesis that these actually were</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.840" style="s2">being sustainably harvested the new ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.950" end="00:53:50.510" style="s2">in other words we might end up with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.840" end="00:53:51.980" style="s2">same problem but let&#39;s go back again to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.510" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">what another thing that was mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.980" end="00:53:57.410" style="s2">earlier and that is electronic gear and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:59.540" style="s2">so forth well it&#39;s it&#39;s not exactly new</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.410" end="00:54:02.870" style="s2">but it&#39;s in this period from about 1970</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.540" end="00:54:04.670" style="s2">on and this man got an honorary</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.870" end="00:54:09.650" style="s2">Doctorate from I think the University of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.670" end="00:54:12.230" style="s2">New Brunswick and this oddly enough was</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.650" end="00:54:15.260" style="s2">one of his boats which I happen to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.230" end="00:54:18.110" style="s2">in the drydock in lüneburg and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.260" end="00:54:20.030" style="s2">captain Medford Matthews was a real</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.110" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">innovator with gear and he brought</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.030" end="00:54:24.620" style="s2">inside this wasn&#39;t the first trawler</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:26.420" style="s2">that came by any means into the region</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.620" end="00:54:30.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like the early</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.420" end="00:54:32.270" style="s2">brand of the the trawlers that are of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.110" end="00:54:34.010" style="s2">modern type and well equipped with all</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.270" end="00:54:36.710" style="s2">the gear that can take a lot of fish</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.010" end="00:54:38.990" style="s2">sonar things and other equipment well</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.710" end="00:54:40.100" style="s2">here&#39;s what they look like no here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.990" end="00:54:42.680" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.100" end="00:54:44.660" style="s2">a couple of kayakers for scale and these</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.680" end="00:54:48.860" style="s2">things are essentially the bulldozers of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.660" end="00:54:52.070" style="s2">the sea they they do so much damage to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.860" end="00:54:55.580" style="s2">the bottom they rip things up and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.070" end="00:54:57.950" style="s2">think eventually probably will see these</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.580" end="00:55:01.460" style="s2">things phased out for other types of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.950" end="00:55:04.520" style="s2">gear that&#39;s my hypothesis but in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.460" end="00:55:05.750" style="s2">interim these are deadly machines for</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.520" end="00:55:08.180" style="s2">from the point of view of what they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.750" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">haul for fish it doesn&#39;t mean that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.180" end="00:55:13.850" style="s2">can&#39;t be made to be useful contributors</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:17.600" style="s2">towards sustainability if they&#39;re held</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.850" end="00:55:20.860" style="s2">in check but particular when you get in</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.600" end="00:55:24.950" style="s2">these big vessels and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.860" end="00:55:27.440" style="s2">facilities on them or factory boats that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.950" end="00:55:29.870" style="s2">can accompany them that can take an</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:31.550" style="s2">immense amount and stay at sea for long</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.870" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">periods of time because they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.550" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">devastate a whole region of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">very quickly now then we move to what</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:46.990" style="s2">happens to fish after it gets caught if</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:51.560" style="s2">you look at this plant at the top</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.990" end="00:55:54.380" style="s2">national seafoods is the world&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.560" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">the world&#39;s major fishing companies and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.380" end="00:55:59.060" style="s2">one of the largest ones in Canada this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:01.670" style="s2">plant located in Lunenburg was the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.060" end="00:56:03.830" style="s2">world&#39;s largest fish plant in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.670" end="00:56:05.840" style="s2">now my daughter Laura will quite well</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.830" end="00:56:08.510" style="s2">remember when we used to go down to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.840" end="00:56:12.440" style="s2">cottage some days we were downwind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.510" end="00:56:14.450" style="s2">this this boat this plant and it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.440" end="00:56:16.040" style="s2">just a bad smell they were taking all</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.450" end="00:56:18.860" style="s2">the remains and make cooking it to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.040" end="00:56:22.570" style="s2">it into a fish meal and selling it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.860" end="00:56:22.570" style="s2">what this national Seif would do now</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.620" end="00:56:29.900" style="s2">white-fleshed fish such as cod haddock</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.930" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">and Pollock and a bunch of others are</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.900" end="00:56:35.150" style="s2">kind of what some people in the banking</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.560" style="s2">business would call fungible ie they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.150" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">all you can exchange them</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.560" end="00:56:40.310" style="s2">interchangeably they&#39;re white flesh you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.100" style="s2">can make them into fish and chips you</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.310" end="00:56:44.610" style="s2">can even take something like tilapia</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.100" end="00:56:47.010" style="s2">which is a freshwater fish in</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.610" end="00:56:50.100" style="s2">call it Cod and that happens sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.010" end="00:56:52.260" style="s2">illegally but it happens so in today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.100" end="00:56:54.450" style="s2">market supply chain because China has</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.260" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">become the most efficient processor they</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.450" end="00:56:57.870" style="s2">get all this fish go into China and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:56:59.190" style="s2">goes through big ports like Rotterdam</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.870" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">where it gets all muddled up it could</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.190" end="00:57:02.970" style="s2">come from West Africa it could come from</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:07.110" style="s2">South North America or whatever gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.970" end="00:57:09.720" style="s2">turned into chunks of fish that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.110" end="00:57:11.730" style="s2">partially processed there then it comes</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.720" end="00:57:15.030" style="s2">back to companies like the one in</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.730" end="00:57:16.890" style="s2">lüneburg where people squirt some nice</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.030" end="00:57:18.360" style="s2">things on top of it and maybe make it a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.890" end="00:57:19.620" style="s2">little fancy or make it into a frozen</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.360" end="00:57:22.200" style="s2">dinner or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.620" end="00:57:23.910" style="s2">then it gets stuff made in Canada and</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.200" end="00:57:25.710" style="s2">then sent to the United States are</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.910" end="00:57:28.950" style="s2">consumed in Canada or maybe in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.710" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">even so that&#39;s that&#39;s a reality so if</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.950" end="00:57:31.980" style="s2">you were listening to the radio in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.500" style="s2">last few weeks there&#39;s been a release of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.980" end="00:57:37.170" style="s2">a report that estimates that something</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.500" end="00:57:39.690" style="s2">like 30% of this fish is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.170" end="00:57:41.190" style="s2">mislabeled because once it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.690" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">Rotterdam or wherever you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.190" end="00:57:45.360" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a cod or what whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:48.810" style="s2">happens to be so a market supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.360" end="00:57:50.520" style="s2">go through this complex thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.810" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">makes it very difficult for us to know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.520" end="00:57:54.990" style="s2">eight whether we&#39;re really eating what</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:57.420" style="s2">we think is caught or whatever else it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.990" end="00:58:01.470" style="s2">might be be whether it was caught</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.420" end="00:58:03.660" style="s2">sustainably or even whether it went</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.470" end="00:58:06.360" style="s2">through some mishap and it&#39;s in its</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.660" end="00:58:09.030" style="s2">process that lowered the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.360" end="00:58:13.020" style="s2">fish this has become a major major</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.030" end="00:58:14.910" style="s2">problem in ocean management and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.020" end="00:58:16.140" style="s2">management of a seafood chains the sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.910" end="00:58:18.180" style="s2">of thing that you&#39;re talking about if</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.140" end="00:58:19.970" style="s2">you want to be a good citizen and only</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.180" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">eat sustainably produced fish</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.970" end="00:58:26.850" style="s2">fortunately there are solutions but just</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:30.180" style="s2">to give you another example of this and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.850" end="00:58:32.430" style="s2">this is an area where Australia was</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.180" end="00:58:34.830" style="s2">furious with us see these this large</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.430" end="00:58:36.810" style="s2">fish the Patagonian toothfish which some</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.830" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">of you may have eaten this show how many</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.810" end="00:58:40.410" style="s2">people and I shouldn&#39;t ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:43.500" style="s2">but if you want to raise your hand have</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.410" end="00:58:45.480" style="s2">you ever eaten Chilean sea bass okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.500" end="00:58:47.850" style="s2">well Chilean sea bass is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.480" end="00:58:49.980" style="s2">fancy names that&#39;s given for something</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.850" end="00:58:52.170" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a fish coming from</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.980" end="00:58:54.600" style="s2">Antarctica and for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.170" end="00:58:55.700" style="s2">unsustainably produced and at one point</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.600" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">in time this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.700" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">been cleaned up quite a bit now but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:04.130" style="s2">was going from Antarctica I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:05.660" style="s2">much an unregulated fishery even though</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.130" end="00:59:07.849" style="s2">the Australians were really making a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.660" end="00:59:10.910" style="s2">pitch for it and and then he would go to</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.849" end="00:59:12.800" style="s2">China it would be handled there then it</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.910" end="00:59:14.270" style="s2">would come to Canada and then it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.800" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">transshipped in the United States as</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.270" end="00:59:19.609" style="s2">Canadian fish Australians weren&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">happy about that I can tell you but but</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.609" end="00:59:24.050" style="s2">again this just illustrates things so</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:26.570" style="s2">one of the ways to get around this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.050" end="00:59:28.760" style="s2">through all these various choices that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.570" end="00:59:30.470" style="s2">you can make and people that help you to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.760" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">make good choices it started with the</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.779" end="01:01:29.539" style="s2">or more shark fins are going now</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.210" end="01:01:31.789" style="s2">little-known facts I think the facts but</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.539" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s always interested me in Nova Scotia</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.789" end="01:01:35.869" style="s2">that there&#39;s been a sword fishery and if</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:37.400" style="s2">you go back far enough there was there</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.869" end="01:01:40.369" style="s2">was all sorts of books written by people</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.400" end="01:01:41.930" style="s2">I think the same gray type of books very</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.369" end="01:01:45.859" style="s2">rich people used to go to Nova Scotia</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.930" end="01:01:50.980" style="s2">and catch them off as a sport fishery</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.859" end="01:01:54.259" style="s2">but in the 1940s still even there was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.980" end="01:01:57.140" style="s2">harpoon sword fishery in Glace Bay up in</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.259" end="01:01:58.849" style="s2">Cape Breton Island hundreds and hundreds</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.140" end="01:02:02.509" style="s2">of boats this is just one picture from</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.849" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">the from the era and they had these</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.509" end="01:02:06.529" style="s2">canoes that they went out in and men</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:09.190" style="s2">would go out there with harpoon waiting</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.529" end="01:02:11.990" style="s2">to catch up 400 or more pound swordfish</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.190" end="01:02:14.900" style="s2">the interesting point about it is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.990" end="01:02:16.609" style="s2">still exists and one of the points right</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.900" end="01:02:19.069" style="s2">now is that the Marine Stewardship</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.609" end="01:02:21.380" style="s2">Council has been asked to certify</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.069" end="01:02:25.700" style="s2">harpoon fisheries in the United States</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.380" end="01:02:27.470" style="s2">and in Canada and then also the pelagic</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.700" end="01:02:30.349" style="s2">longline now you&#39;ve got introduced to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.470" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">the longline and and some people wrap</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.349" end="01:02:33.710" style="s2">their hands to put their hands for their</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:35.660" style="s2">heart and say the longline is the way to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.710" end="01:02:37.849" style="s2">go because it&#39;s not involving those</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.660" end="01:02:40.069" style="s2">trawlers but what the longline does is</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.849" end="01:02:41.569" style="s2">catches turtles sharks and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.069" end="01:02:44.210" style="s2">other things that are not the wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.569" end="01:02:47.529" style="s2">species at the same time as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.210" end="01:02:49.880" style="s2">catching swordfish but controversy Leigh</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.529" end="01:02:52.569" style="s2">the Marine Stewardship Council has</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.880" end="01:02:55.730" style="s2">awarded the Northwest Atlantic Canadians</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.579" end="01:03:11.990" style="s2">interesting thing is that already</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.710" end="01:03:14.509" style="s2">awarded the spear fishery for the sari</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.990" end="01:03:14.950" style="s2">of these yes the spear fishery for the</p>

<p begin="01:03:14.950" end="01:03:19.240" style="s2">three they&#39;re still getting Spears out</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.589" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">there and if you go if you google</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.240" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">something along those lines you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:25.180" style="s2">actually see little things for sportsmen</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:29.730" style="s2">in the United States for example going</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.180" end="01:03:32.950" style="s2">out on boats and throwing their harpoons</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.730" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">but you can see what happens in the that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.950" end="01:03:36.670" style="s2">the government in the late 90s really</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">put a clamp on things because you could</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.670" end="01:03:41.859" style="s2">see the decline on the on the swordfish</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:43.650" style="s2">going down there and went below what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.859" end="01:03:46.510" style="s2">considered a maximum sustainable yield</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.650" end="01:03:48.849" style="s2">biomass and and you can see as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.510" end="01:03:50.980" style="s2">consequence of stopping that fishery and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.849" end="01:03:53.380" style="s2">how it&#39;s built up to the point now where</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.980" end="01:03:55.780" style="s2">they feel that they can reinstitute a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.380" end="01:03:56.829" style="s2">limited sword fishery so these are the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.780" end="01:03:58.540" style="s2">sorts of things this is this is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.829" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">oddball little example it&#39;s not one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.540" end="01:04:03.369" style="s2">the great fisheries but there&#39;s dozens</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">even hundreds of these other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.369" end="01:04:06.630" style="s2">fisheries out there that don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:10.089" style="s2">same kind of presses to the cod fishery</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.630" end="01:04:12.670" style="s2">the big ones the biggest single thing we</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.089" end="01:04:15.880" style="s2">have going for us now is the lobster and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.670" end="01:04:18.970" style="s2">then havoc is a ground fish that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.880" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">still retaining some place that made and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.970" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">the scale of things a very nice fish to</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:24.970" style="s2">eat but these are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:26.920" style="s2">sustain the small communities and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.970" end="01:04:29.310" style="s2">social order of Nova Scotia Bay of Fundy</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.920" end="01:04:33.400" style="s2">and so forth but the point here is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.310" end="01:04:34.990" style="s2">the havoc went down and it went down</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.400" end="01:04:37.569" style="s2">maybe because of what were fishing but</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.990" end="01:04:40.900" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t on the scale of overfishing of</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.569" end="01:04:42.819" style="s2">the card and almost certainly water</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.900" end="01:04:44.829" style="s2">temperature has played a role in it so</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.819" end="01:04:48.130" style="s2">again what&#39;s cause and effect between</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.829" end="01:04:50.230" style="s2">fishing pressure and fish abundance</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.130" end="01:04:53.109" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s very clear here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.230" end="01:04:54.940" style="s2">another one this just a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.109" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">took this picture last weekend or</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.940" end="01:04:59.380" style="s2">weekend before one day fishery and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:02.530" style="s2">get all these collections of boats going</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.380" end="01:05:04.900" style="s2">out and and they kill immensely if they</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.530" end="01:05:07.089" style="s2">take huge schools of herring and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.900" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">the gulls and other birds are there</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.089" end="01:05:13.180" style="s2">Eagles etc and the point here though is</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">that the abundance of herring is at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.180" end="01:05:18.280" style="s2">greatest level in the last 30 to 40</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:20.619" style="s2">years responsible fishery scientists</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.280" end="01:05:21.990" style="s2">would say we have no idea of why they</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.619" end="01:05:23.940" style="s2">may claim credit to it</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.990" end="01:05:25.500" style="s2">because of our careful management but</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.940" end="01:05:28.170" style="s2">it&#39;s been up and down and up and down</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.500" end="01:05:29.820" style="s2">this I don&#39;t have time there&#39;s an awful</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.170" end="01:05:32.010" style="s2">lot of interesting stories about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.820" end="01:05:34.339" style="s2">fishery and about the way the native</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.010" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">people the first nations along the coast</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.339" end="01:05:38.010" style="s2">perceive how it should be managed where</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:39.450" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t have any of these bullets</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.010" end="01:05:41.820" style="s2">out there they would be because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.450" end="01:05:44.790" style="s2">mainly managed for herring rolling of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.820" end="01:05:48.810" style="s2">eggs and and they go to Japan and places</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.790" end="01:05:52.530" style="s2">like that but they would manage by</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.810" end="01:05:55.020" style="s2">lifting the things out of kelp where</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.530" end="01:05:56.730" style="s2">they&#39;ve been spawned by the official</p>

<p begin="01:05:56.730" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">period so there&#39;s differing points of</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.250" end="01:06:02.310" style="s2">view of what you can do and some of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:07.560" style="s2">those things I think are going to be the</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.630" end="01:06:43.589" style="s2">aquaculture and anybody anybody here</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.349" end="01:06:45.359" style="s2">from BC great well you know that this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.589" end="01:06:47.190" style="s2">not exactly an easy subject in British</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.190" end="01:06:53.339" style="s2">on it and it&#39;s really difficult but look</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.520" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">at this this is a plot several years ago</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.339" end="01:06:58.619" style="s2">of watersheds in Canada because you have</p>

<p begin="01:06:58.619" end="01:07:02.430" style="s2">in British Columbia I should say for</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.570" end="01:07:05.520" style="s2">sockeye Salmons in decline so the yellow</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.430" end="01:07:08.580" style="s2">and red watersheds huge watersheds under</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.520" end="01:07:10.589" style="s2">threat that&#39;s likely to increase because</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.580" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">of global warming and the streams are</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.589" end="01:07:14.040" style="s2">warming up and other things happening in</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:17.040" style="s2">the watersheds the pine bark beetle</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.780" end="01:07:24.810" style="s2">season so the salmon is truly in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.480" end="01:07:27.720" style="s2">no matter what aquaculture if you look</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.810" end="01:07:28.730" style="s2">at a net like this this is a fairly well</p>

<p begin="01:07:31.790" end="01:07:37.970" style="s2">each of those netted areas holds about</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:44.660" style="s2">quite amazing so this is just fish</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.990" end="01:07:49.250" style="s2">packed in place the fish aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.660" end="01:07:51.380" style="s2">discontented and this varying points of</p>

<p begin="01:07:51.380" end="01:07:57.200" style="s2">that our Prime Minister appointed</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.369" end="01:07:59.510" style="s2">justice from British Columbia was called</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.200" end="01:08:01.100" style="s2">the Cohen Commission to look at the</p>

<p begin="01:08:04.340" end="01:08:10.100" style="s2">all of this but the basic point is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.030" end="01:08:11.630" style="s2">Cohen said if if people were expecting</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.100" end="01:08:15.650" style="s2">that I&#39;d find a smoking gun one</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.630" end="01:08:17.270" style="s2">causality to it no no way and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.650" end="01:08:18.620" style="s2">certainly felt that would be what he</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.270" end="01:08:20.569" style="s2">would come up with at the end that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.620" end="01:08:22.520" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of factors but read</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.569" end="01:08:25.569" style="s2">what he says Fraser River sockeye faced</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.520" end="01:08:28.210" style="s2">an uncertain future shrinking resources</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.569" end="01:08:30.310" style="s2">which may result in delays and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.210" end="01:08:32.569" style="s2">implementing reforms and research</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.310" end="01:08:34.190" style="s2">shrinking and shrinking resources being</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.569" end="01:08:38.390" style="s2">less money around</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.190" end="01:08:40.040" style="s2">DFO has been cut badly meaning that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.390" end="01:08:42.290" style="s2">stressors to which sockeye are exposed</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.040" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">will continue and the deterioration of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.290" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">sockeye habitats will get worse the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:49.339" style="s2">waters constituting Fraser River sockeye</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:52.160" style="s2">habitat are warming and then pointing</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.339" end="01:08:53.270" style="s2">out that basically because the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.160" end="01:08:55.609" style="s2">government had taken a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.270" end="01:08:58.970" style="s2">amendments before receiving as to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.609" end="01:09:00.470" style="s2">Fisheries Act that in fact the future of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.970" end="01:09:02.029" style="s2">management of the Fraser rivers is</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.470" end="01:09:06.529" style="s2">unknown and that&#39;s putting it in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.029" end="01:09:08.270" style="s2">most positive terms and and so these are</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.529" end="01:09:10.160" style="s2">guarded comments the whole report the</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.270" end="01:09:12.680" style="s2">summary of that if you want to get a</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.160" end="01:09:14.540" style="s2">sense of that particular very important</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.680" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">resource and why it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.540" end="01:09:21.319" style="s2">manage read that report so my my concern</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">see we have these various things that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.319" end="01:09:24.860" style="s2">can do in Canada</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:27.650" style="s2">for the oceans and two big things what</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.860" end="01:09:29.360" style="s2">is the Fisheries Act which is in is in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.650" end="01:09:31.610" style="s2">very old one of the first pieces of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.360" end="01:09:33.560" style="s2">legislation we had encountered and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.610" end="01:09:35.660" style="s2">won&#39;t give you a boring and dull</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.560" end="01:09:38.030" style="s2">description of all the parts of it but</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.660" end="01:09:40.370" style="s2">it sets the basis for conservation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.030" end="01:09:42.920" style="s2">fish for Pollution Control and a number</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.370" end="01:09:45.890" style="s2">of other things related to habitat etc</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.920" end="01:09:49.430" style="s2">and also sovereignty over our resource</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.890" end="01:09:51.170" style="s2">and sovereignty between the federal</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.430" end="01:09:54.080" style="s2">government and provincial governments</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.170" end="01:09:55.940" style="s2">and its management it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.080" end="01:09:57.770" style="s2">piece of legislation it&#39;s been changed</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.940" end="01:10:00.680" style="s2">quite dramatically in the last year</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.770" end="01:10:03.500" style="s2">placing less emphasis on the habitat</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.680" end="01:10:05.360" style="s2">aspect in particular but we also have</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:07.040" style="s2">the oceans Act in Canada and this was a</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.360" end="01:10:10.100" style="s2">new piece of legislation that came out</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.040" end="01:10:13.100" style="s2">in the 1990s and and essentially set a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.100" end="01:10:15.560" style="s2">new basis of management around</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.100" end="01:10:17.780" style="s2">ecosystems sustainable development and</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.560" end="01:10:19.880" style="s2">in other words balancing between the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.780" end="01:10:22.970" style="s2">various kinds of uses of the ocean and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.880" end="01:10:27.050" style="s2">specified the need for attention to mat</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.970" end="01:10:28.850" style="s2">and marine protected areas and also what</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.050" end="01:10:31.220" style="s2">was called law of eventually became</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.850" end="01:10:33.020" style="s2">called Wilma&#39;s large ocean management</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.220" end="01:10:35.690" style="s2">areas to take big chunks of the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.020" end="01:10:36.890" style="s2">and try and develop plans for them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.690" end="01:10:39.070" style="s2">just going to give you a very brief</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.890" end="01:10:41.570" style="s2">overview of a few of these and you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.070" end="01:10:43.970" style="s2">this talk will be available to anybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.570" end="01:10:48.590" style="s2">that wants it and you can see in more</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.970" end="01:10:50.540" style="s2">detail but but the lomas represent move</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.590" end="01:10:53.240" style="s2">towards the ecosystem based approach and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.540" end="01:10:54.950" style="s2">and one that&#39;s based on consultation</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.240" end="01:10:56.780" style="s2">among the various users whether they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.780" end="01:11:01.790" style="s2">gas fisheries and so forth it&#39;s building</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.570" end="01:11:04.430" style="s2">relationships and dialogue among the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.790" end="01:11:07.820" style="s2">various users and the idea is to plan</p>

<p begin="01:11:07.820" end="01:11:11.990" style="s2">strategies that you could actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.290" end="01:11:16.820" style="s2">implement and get that information in</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.990" end="01:11:19.690" style="s2">advance of development so one that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.820" end="01:11:22.940" style="s2">very familiar with is isom east coast</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.690" end="01:11:24.100" style="s2">Scotian shell and they produce good work</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.940" end="01:11:25.960" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.100" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">or they won&#39;t talk about it anymore one</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.960" end="01:11:31.390" style="s2">that&#39;s citizen led scientists led and</p>

<p begin="01:11:31.390" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">is the area of the Gulf of Maine</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.250" end="01:11:37.150" style="s2">particularly Georges Bank as part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:37.630" style="s2">that and then happened to the Bay of</p>

<p begin="01:11:37.630" end="01:11:44.040" style="s2">and here the federal government has a</p>

<p begin="01:11:44.040" end="01:11:48.970" style="s2">it&#39;s been the States and the province is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.660" end="01:11:50.590" style="s2">working together that&#39;s really done some</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.970" end="01:11:52.450" style="s2">very innovative work won&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.590" end="01:11:54.490" style="s2">go into it but I wanted to say just one</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.450" end="01:11:57.070" style="s2">thing if you take this is the boundary</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.490" end="01:11:58.690" style="s2">line between the two countries painful</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.070" end="01:11:59.800" style="s2">they worked out and I could tell you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.690" end="01:12:02.110" style="s2">interesting stories about that because</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.800" end="01:12:04.720" style="s2">it was had some role and some of that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.110" end="01:12:06.190" style="s2">was very interesting but if you look up</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.720" end="01:12:16.560" style="s2">towards the Bay of Fundy and intent</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.190" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">towards New Brunswick which is Wales and</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.560" end="01:12:21.910" style="s2">ships collide up there because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:23.740" style="s2">where it&#39;s a natural one of these areas</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.910" end="01:12:25.930" style="s2">with lots of occurrence flowing and</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.740" end="01:12:27.670" style="s2">gyres and so forth and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.930" end="01:12:29.290" style="s2">incredibly productive the whales come up</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.670" end="01:12:31.090" style="s2">there to feed in the summer some of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.290" end="01:12:32.860" style="s2">scarcest with humpbacks are there but</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.090" end="01:12:34.420" style="s2">some of the other whales and and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.860" end="01:12:38.380" style="s2">glide with the ships so you get these</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.420" end="01:12:40.510" style="s2">ships going up into particularly for an</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.380" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">oil refinery located up there and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.510" end="01:12:44.290" style="s2">find a whale draped over this they have</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:46.450" style="s2">a kind of a bulbous front on them and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.290" end="01:12:48.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a whale dead whale there and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.450" end="01:12:51.010" style="s2">so the right whales particularly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.670" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">only about 300 of them left I think and</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.010" end="01:12:57.260" style="s2">they were being knocked out right now</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:59.390" style="s2">intended in that area so there was a</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.260" end="01:13:01.250" style="s2">simple solution it was a very simple</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.390" end="01:13:04.190" style="s2">solution and one that&#39;s worked</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.250" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">remarkably well they just changed the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.190" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">shipping lane slightly and they put in</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:09.710" style="s2">place a kind of a spotting mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.910" end="01:13:10.850" style="s2">because you can see the whales and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.710" end="01:13:12.620" style="s2">people would know where the whales</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.850" end="01:13:14.090" style="s2">tended to be clustered on a given day so</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.620" end="01:13:17.330" style="s2">there&#39;s some leeway and where the ships</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.090" end="01:13:20.450" style="s2">go and problem not completely solved but</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.330" end="01:13:22.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say 80% solved so this there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.450" end="01:13:26.600" style="s2">really are win-win situations out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.280" end="01:13:28.580" style="s2">and the charge for that was led by you</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.600" end="01:13:30.170" style="s2">can see how Nova Scotia goes down to</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.580" end="01:13:31.460" style="s2">kind of a little point nothing up the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.170" end="01:13:33.620" style="s2">big part of Nova Scotia but this a</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.460" end="01:13:36.710" style="s2">little kind of peninsula beautiful place</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.620" end="01:13:39.770" style="s2">the school teacher was living out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.710" end="01:13:43.160" style="s2">and she took it upon herself to be part</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.770" end="01:13:45.470" style="s2">of the solution and organized local</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.160" end="01:13:47.110" style="s2">groups to actually spot and be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.470" end="01:13:49.190" style="s2">say where the whales would be and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.110" end="01:13:50.450" style="s2">demonstrate it to the scientist who</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.190" end="01:13:52.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t really believe in this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.450" end="01:13:55.040" style="s2">think very strongly that that it could</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.820" end="01:13:57.140" style="s2">actually be a solution so it started</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.040" end="01:13:59.090" style="s2">from a citizen and I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.140" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">respect for what I see as citizen</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.090" end="01:14:03.290" style="s2">science in the oceans throughout this</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:04.850" style="s2">country and give you many other examples</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.290" end="01:14:07.580" style="s2">in the West Coast and in the Arctic and</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.850" end="01:14:10.340" style="s2">so forth another one that I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.580" end="01:14:13.670" style="s2">involves a heavy degree of citizen input</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.340" end="01:14:15.140" style="s2">is the same Gulf of st. Lawrence action</p>

<p begin="01:14:21.650" end="01:14:25.750" style="s2">civic committees exist throughout the</p>

<p begin="01:14:29.960" end="01:14:35.120" style="s2">the the neat thing about it is that it</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.110" end="01:14:37.850" style="s2">brings the stakeholders together and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.120" end="01:14:39.950" style="s2">they come to real solutions about local</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.950" end="01:14:45.590" style="s2">Gulf of st. Lawrence and the government</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.110" end="01:14:47.630" style="s2">and others provide a broader input into</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.630" end="01:14:51.110" style="s2">plan would look like so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.340" end="01:14:53.090" style="s2">degree of coherence throughout the whole</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.110" end="01:14:55.940" style="s2">region now these are good things that</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.090" end="01:14:58.150" style="s2">are happening and they they they&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:17:03.860" end="01:17:09.610" style="s2">about 15 years ago somebody discovered</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.100" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">that there was huge beds of these things</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.610" end="01:17:16.390" style="s2">around this area that primarily in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:18.010" style="s2">area is kind of a pale orange so what</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.390" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">are you gonna do about it these were</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.010" end="01:17:22.390" style="s2">areas that were just beginning to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:23.620" style="s2">used heavily by trawlers the trawlers</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.390" end="01:17:25.720" style="s2">were starting to plow right through</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.620" end="01:17:27.640" style="s2">these ancient beds because these some of</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.720" end="01:17:32.050" style="s2">these are thousands of years old</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.640" end="01:17:33.850" style="s2">and a stop was put to it and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.050" end="01:17:35.320" style="s2">all plotted we know where they are</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.850" end="01:17:38.940" style="s2">there was an exclusion zones for the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.320" end="01:17:42.280" style="s2">corals for the fisheries and the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.940" end="01:17:44.680" style="s2">Iran up till about 2000 there was an</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.280" end="01:17:46.930" style="s2">official almost denial that there was</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.680" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">these soft corals that were found on the</p>

<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:51.820" style="s2">complaining about particularly long</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.720" end="01:17:53.230" style="s2">liners that that the trawlers were going</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.820" end="01:17:56.200" style="s2">through and bringing up these things and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.230" end="01:17:58.750" style="s2">I went to a Fisher fishery associations</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.200" end="01:18:00.610" style="s2">Museum and Southwest Nova Scotia and</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.750" end="01:18:03.370" style="s2">they had all these big corals and if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.610" end="01:18:05.560" style="s2">went on the west coast to to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.370" end="01:18:09.160" style="s2">command not commercial but sports</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.560" end="01:18:10.690" style="s2">fishing shops and bullit places they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.160" end="01:18:12.310" style="s2">have them on the wall the same thing on</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.690" end="01:18:15.550" style="s2">the west coast well officially they</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.310" end="01:18:17.530" style="s2">didn&#39;t exist and finally they did exist</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.550" end="01:18:19.570" style="s2">and now there&#39;s all sorts of exclusion</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.530" end="01:18:21.940" style="s2">Ares for the red corals as well so</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.570" end="01:18:24.190" style="s2">progress but it&#39;s slow and it&#39;s painful</p>

<p begin="01:18:25.660" end="01:18:30.520" style="s2">questions about it but but this is the</p>

<p begin="01:19:33.939" end="01:19:38.329" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to get in places</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.929" end="01:19:39.800" style="s2">Lancaster Sound Lancaster sound there</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.329" end="01:19:42.169" style="s2">was one of the first places where they</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.800" end="01:19:45.079" style="s2">were CEOs planning in Canada and at that</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.169" end="01:19:46.069" style="s2">time those in the 1980s people were kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.079" end="01:19:49.189" style="s2">of looking at as a bit of a curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.069" end="01:19:51.559" style="s2">now this is a very important part of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.189" end="01:19:53.089" style="s2">Northwest Passage that will become one</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.559" end="01:19:55.579" style="s2">of the area&#39;s used for shipping</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.089" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">eventually there&#39;s a large part of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.579" end="01:20:01.369" style="s2">is now proposed as a National</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:02.959" style="s2">Conservation Area and this will be very</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.369" end="01:20:05.359" style="s2">interesting to see what this will</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.959" end="01:20:07.819" style="s2">actually mean in reality now I want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.359" end="01:20:09.889" style="s2">point out the the National Marine</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.819" end="01:20:12.319" style="s2">Conservation Area because we actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.889" end="01:20:14.389" style="s2">have legislation saying that all the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.319" end="01:20:16.609" style="s2">representative areas in Canada there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.389" end="01:20:19.069" style="s2">26 or 27 of them something like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.609" end="01:20:21.589" style="s2">each of those kinds of habitats should</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.069" end="01:20:26.209" style="s2">have representative areas where you</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.589" end="01:20:28.429" style="s2">could actually pinpoint and say AHA this</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.209" end="01:20:31.039" style="s2">is this area is protected within that</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.429" end="01:20:32.899" style="s2">and it will tell us about the area it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.039" end="01:20:35.179" style="s2">could be of use for fisheries management</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.899" end="01:20:35.689" style="s2">and so forth helping to replenish those</p>

<p begin="01:20:35.689" end="01:20:43.069" style="s2">we&#39;re far from there just to highlight</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.469" end="01:20:46.249" style="s2">again what Jordan was saying look at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.069" end="01:20:48.409" style="s2">small percentage of protected areas and</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.249" end="01:20:50.209" style="s2">the oceans in Canada compared to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.409" end="01:20:53.510" style="s2">last year most people would say in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.209" end="01:20:55.219" style="s2">land areas it&#39;s not enough so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.510" end="01:20:57.349" style="s2">look at the detail of this but these</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.219" end="01:21:00.499" style="s2">shows all these different types of areas</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.349" end="01:21:04.329" style="s2">know that you can look at Hudson Bay for</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.499" end="01:21:07.189" style="s2">example or the north and south part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.329" end="01:21:08.739" style="s2">West Coast Pacific coast there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.189" end="01:21:12.889" style="s2">of areas but particularly in the Arctic</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.739" end="01:21:14.719" style="s2">we need a lot more effort and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.889" end="01:21:18.260" style="s2">things that sea pause which has been a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.719" end="01:21:20.479" style="s2">prime contributor to this they have a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.260" end="01:21:22.519" style="s2">whole list of thing that they feel are</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.679" end="01:21:30.210" style="s2">at this point in time so we do have a</p>

<p begin="01:21:30.210" end="01:21:35.820" style="s2">talk is very cheap called the national</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.580" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">network of MBAs do we have a national</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.820" end="01:21:40.620" style="s2">network of MPAs in Canada well here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:40.620" end="01:21:46.140" style="s2">respect a lot through the Pew foundation</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.960" end="01:21:47.040" style="s2">daniel pauly from UBC fishery centre is</p>

<p begin="01:22:07.440" end="01:22:11.550" style="s2">and so forth I can go out in my kayak</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.510" end="01:22:13.530" style="s2">and go run around the ecological</p>

<p begin="01:22:14.489" end="01:22:19.469" style="s2">for birds for example marine parks and</p>

<p begin="01:22:28.920" end="01:22:33.330" style="s2">the coast you know a small pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.480" end="01:22:35.730" style="s2">boats are big pleasure boats so this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.330" end="01:22:37.200" style="s2">a kind of overstates the case but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.730" end="01:22:40.530" style="s2">not Daniel Pollock&#39;s fault this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.200" end="01:22:43.730" style="s2">following certain criteria we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.530" end="01:22:46.650" style="s2">starting to see this now emerge as</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.730" end="01:22:50.040" style="s2">networks within the regions so for</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.650" end="01:22:53.160" style="s2">example there&#39;s whale sanctuaries coral</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.040" end="01:22:54.840" style="s2">sanctuaries and a place called the gully</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.160" end="01:22:57.330" style="s2">where a lot of the really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.840" end="01:23:00.600" style="s2">whales that are offshore from Nova</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.330" end="01:23:02.100" style="s2">Scotia collect now and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.600" end="01:23:03.390" style="s2">lot of actually land-based ones so that</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.100" end="01:23:06.930" style="s2">you&#39;re primarily for birds and</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.390" end="01:23:08.700" style="s2">protection of wetlands the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.930" end="01:23:11.160" style="s2">this is can you really call it a network</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.700" end="01:23:13.680" style="s2">what are the criteria what how will it</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.160" end="01:23:15.180" style="s2">relate how will all of this relate that</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.680" end="01:23:17.489" style="s2">I&#39;ve got on this diagram</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.180" end="01:23:19.560" style="s2">how will it relate to sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.489" end="01:23:21.150" style="s2">fisheries management because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.560" end="01:23:23.219" style="s2">kind of question that we should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.150" end="01:23:26.130" style="s2">asking I don&#39;t think we&#39;re asking that</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.219" end="01:23:28.920" style="s2">question very well in Canada now but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.130" end="01:23:30.360" style="s2">would urge thin to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.920" end="01:23:32.880" style="s2">that when you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.360" end="01:23:34.920" style="s2">sustainability of seafood and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.880" end="01:23:36.230" style="s2">how does it relate back to the other</p>

<p begin="01:23:36.230" end="01:23:43.630" style="s2">system and how can we use those tools</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.330" end="01:23:46.790" style="s2">better pen Seba this diagram shows the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.630" end="01:23:48.560" style="s2">all these different places that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.790" end="01:23:53.210" style="s2">mentioned the corals and other areas</p>

<p begin="01:24:11.420" end="01:24:17.540" style="s2">to see if you look at pin seam and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.040" end="01:24:19.190" style="s2">taken it out to the 200-mile zone</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.540" end="01:24:21.650" style="s2">because I feel we should be going out to</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.350" end="01:24:27.680" style="s2">Peninsula is a really I should have put</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.390" end="01:24:30.110" style="s2">a picture of it and it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.680" end="01:24:32.590" style="s2">to see it from the air and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:24:32.590" end="01:24:37.520" style="s2">an interesting place because during the</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.810" end="01:24:40.100" style="s2">Second World War when we were patrolling</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.520" end="01:24:43.550" style="s2">all on the coast for ships coming across</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.100" end="01:24:45.650" style="s2">from Asia a lot of ship a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.550" end="01:24:49.610" style="s2">airplanes were lost in the Bowie ever in</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.650" end="01:24:50.989" style="s2">the Brooks Peninsula because right at</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.610" end="01:24:53.420" style="s2">that point there&#39;s a change in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.989" end="01:24:55.220" style="s2">currents and you get all that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.420" end="01:24:58.040" style="s2">a north and the south current coming and</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.220" end="01:25:00.200" style="s2">they change seasonally and right at that</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.040" end="01:25:01.940" style="s2">point you can get talked to a pilot</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.200" end="01:25:03.980" style="s2">about this when I was flying over it</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.940" end="01:25:05.690" style="s2">with him and he was saying that he had</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.980" end="01:25:08.239" style="s2">actually seen what looked like Niagara</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.690" end="01:25:10.640" style="s2">Falls coming up because the currents are</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.239" end="01:25:13.400" style="s2">clashing you get this water coming up</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.640" end="01:25:15.170" style="s2">rising out of the ocean and and he said</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.400" end="01:25:16.670" style="s2">it was just like this wall of water</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.170" end="01:25:19.640" style="s2">coming up and then crashing down the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.670" end="01:25:21.470" style="s2">other side in the atmosphere so these</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.640" end="01:25:22.850" style="s2">are the things that only pilots see I</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.470" end="01:25:25.940" style="s2">guess but he said an exceedingly</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.850" end="01:25:28.010" style="s2">dangerous area but it&#39;s it&#39;s again a</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.940" end="01:25:29.750" style="s2">very important area separating the north</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.010" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">and the south and the kinds of animal</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.750" end="01:25:33.950" style="s2">migrations whales and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:37.010" style="s2">seabirds and then if you look at the top</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.950" end="01:25:39.380" style="s2">end there&#39;s the Boise mode and there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:25:39.380" end="01:25:45.230" style="s2">almost of the ocean top of the ocean but</p>

<p begin="01:30:23.449" end="01:30:27.949" style="s2">strengthen our commitment to the oceans</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.550" end="01:30:31.340" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve made a start with the</p>

<p begin="01:30:31.340" end="01:30:35.389" style="s2">some good points and it&#39;s faltering in</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.230" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">some key areas and not enough resources</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.389" end="01:30:41.059" style="s2">or even attention is being given to it</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.480" end="01:30:43.780" style="s2">ask when the last time this was reviewed</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.059" end="01:30:46.489" style="s2">in Parliament for example the fisheries</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.780" end="01:30:50.539" style="s2">as far as I can see if the committee</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.489" end="01:30:54.440" style="s2">that deals with fisheries and oceans</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.539" end="01:30:56.570" style="s2">murders in the current Parliament is we</p>

<p begin="01:31:51.150" end="01:31:56.250" style="s2">it&#39;s clear we&#39;re going to be eating more</p>

<p begin="01:32:22.590" end="01:32:26.220" style="s2">like to do that if you ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.360" end="01:32:28.770" style="s2">then I&#39;ll repeat it because then we can</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.220" end="01:32:32.250" style="s2">capture it on video and you&#39;d be more</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.770" end="01:32:42.990" style="s2">than pleased to take questions so if</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.250" end="01:32:47.430" style="s2">anyone has one idea of a progress drop</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.990" end="01:32:49.230" style="s2">so like our ancestors killing two</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.430" end="01:32:50.280" style="s2">minutes let&#39;s say over one is a good</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.230" end="01:32:52.800" style="s2">idea that&#39;s progress</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.280" end="01:32:55.350" style="s2">but once they could drive 200 off a</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.800" end="01:32:57.720" style="s2">cliff and kill an entire herd and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.350" end="01:32:59.910" style="s2">like kill more herds until they all our</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.720" end="01:33:01.230" style="s2">ancestors in those areas would starve to</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.910" end="01:33:05.510" style="s2">death because they kill over minutes</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.230" end="01:33:05.510" style="s2">essentially that would be progress drop</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.090" end="01:33:16.680" style="s2">if that applies if that&#39;s like an over</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.980" end="01:33:18.930" style="s2">simplistic generalization or this so the</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.680" end="01:33:21.150" style="s2">question is whether the idea of progress</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.930" end="01:33:23.720" style="s2">drop is relevant to this issue when a</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.150" end="01:33:26.760" style="s2">progress drop is the expansion of</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.720" end="01:33:31.860" style="s2">technology to harvest beyond sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.760" end="01:33:34.470" style="s2">limits I guess sure sure well it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.860" end="01:33:36.720" style="s2">of a larger problem of traps and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.470" end="01:33:38.490" style="s2">progress traps is certainly one and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.720" end="01:33:40.830" style="s2">get caught in those traps because</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.490" end="01:33:42.420" style="s2">something works well for us for at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.830" end="01:33:44.400" style="s2">time interest and certainly a was true</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.420" end="01:33:48.090" style="s2">in the fisheries case and then when it</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.400" end="01:33:50.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work well we&#39;re still adhering</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.090" end="01:33:52.050" style="s2">to that approach so one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.880" end="01:33:53.940" style="s2">and this is one of the reasons why I</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.050" end="01:33:56.850" style="s2">bring out the ecosystem work and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.940" end="01:33:59.070" style="s2">forth we we have to open our mind to</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.850" end="01:34:00.480" style="s2">alternative possibilities and also</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.070" end="01:34:04.080" style="s2">there&#39;s another little phrase that used</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.480" end="01:34:05.550" style="s2">called option or closure you know for</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.080" end="01:34:08.760" style="s2">example if you lay out all the different</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.550" end="01:34:10.920" style="s2">uses in the ocean and everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.760" end="01:34:12.030" style="s2">scrambling for space in the ocean you</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.920" end="01:34:13.590" style="s2">know the fishermen don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.030" end="01:34:14.940" style="s2">aquaculture because they can&#39;t park</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.590" end="01:34:17.100" style="s2">their boats or their your nets are in</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.940" end="01:34:18.660" style="s2">the way whatever it happens to be the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.100" end="01:34:20.700" style="s2">oil people want one thing the</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.660" end="01:34:23.010" style="s2">aquaculture is don&#39;t want to out there</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.700" end="01:34:25.650" style="s2">so you gotta have some rational case for</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.010" end="01:34:27.930" style="s2">making choices but option for closure if</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.650" end="01:34:30.990" style="s2">you do it well and zoning is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.930" end="01:34:34.740" style="s2">ways to do that allows for more to go on</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.990" end="01:34:36.720" style="s2">but at a lower risk and what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.740" end="01:34:39.390" style="s2">now I think is moving back towards a</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.720" end="01:34:41.850" style="s2">sectoral approach where it happens right</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.390" end="01:34:43.590" style="s2">now that the sector happens to be oil</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.850" end="01:34:46.710" style="s2">and gas it could equally be some other</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.590" end="01:34:48.510" style="s2">sector in the could be deep ocean mining</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.710" end="01:34:52.410" style="s2">for example are shallow ocean running</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.510" end="01:34:54.690" style="s2">and and so we have to have a more</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.410" end="01:34:56.550" style="s2">rational basis and just following</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.690" end="01:34:59.550" style="s2">whatever we think at the moment is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.550" end="01:35:02.340" style="s2">best you know so that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.550" end="01:35:04.290" style="s2">dealing with the progress trap I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.340" end="01:35:05.940" style="s2">there&#39;s also like kind of and maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.290" end="01:35:08.160" style="s2">accompanies it but a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.940" end="01:35:10.980" style="s2">conceptual trap sometimes as well you</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.160" end="01:35:12.870" style="s2">know we we adhere to ideas and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.980" end="01:35:15.600" style="s2">world open our minds up and then</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.870" end="01:35:18.660" style="s2">something comes along it could be some</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.600" end="01:35:20.520" style="s2">terrible accident the classic cases the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.660" end="01:35:22.560" style="s2">Exxon Valdez or something like that and</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.520" end="01:35:25.350" style="s2">suddenly bang you&#39;re in a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.560" end="01:35:26.640" style="s2">environment of thinking and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.350" end="01:35:28.740" style="s2">prepared for it you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.640" end="01:35:30.090" style="s2">solutions you don&#39;t have haven&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.740" end="01:35:32.700" style="s2">your way through the kind of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.090" end="01:35:34.230" style="s2">bases you need and and so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.700" end="01:35:36.420" style="s2">kind of trap that we have to face</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.230" end="01:35:38.970" style="s2">because that&#39;s why I say think about</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.420" end="01:35:40.830" style="s2">accidents many of the changes in our</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.970" end="01:35:43.770" style="s2">society are the result of accidents and</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.830" end="01:35:45.630" style="s2">something so awful happens that we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.770" end="01:35:49.770" style="s2">to think of a new way of doing things</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.630" end="01:35:52.290" style="s2">and so a lot of what I think the</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.770" end="01:35:54.840" style="s2">scientific community is dealing with in</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.290" end="01:35:56.760" style="s2">the oceans right now is to say we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.840" end="01:35:59.280" style="s2">to prepare ourselves for a future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.760" end="01:36:01.260" style="s2">very uncertain and therefore we need to</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.280" end="01:36:03.600" style="s2">have a lot of knowledge and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.260" end="01:36:06.270" style="s2">ask a lot of what-ifs so that we are</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.600" end="01:36:07.679" style="s2">prepared to make Direction shifts as</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.270" end="01:36:09.570" style="s2">necessary in the future</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.679" end="01:36:12.270" style="s2">from climate change or some horrible</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.570" end="01:36:15.000" style="s2">accident or just changing priorities in</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.270" end="01:36:17.790" style="s2">society one of those priorities for sure</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.000" end="01:36:19.199" style="s2">is that all those certification programs</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.790" end="01:36:22.409" style="s2">are going to become the way we do</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.199" end="01:36:24.030" style="s2">business and those people who are not</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.409" end="01:36:25.440" style="s2">engaged in that in the fisheries are</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.030" end="01:36:28.969" style="s2">going to learn the hard way that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.440" end="01:36:28.969" style="s2">prediction for five to ten years</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.640" end="01:36:46.230" style="s2">question is the negative potential</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.960" end="01:36:47.489" style="s2">negative consequences of zoning yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.230" end="01:36:53.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question really good</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.489" end="01:36:56.550" style="s2">question well to start with it is if you</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.670" end="01:36:57.540" style="s2">impose zoning it&#39;s almost certainly</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.550" end="01:36:59.460" style="s2">going to have a lot of negative</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.540" end="01:37:01.620" style="s2">consequences one of which is people</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.460" end="01:37:04.409" style="s2">simply won&#39;t accept it and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.620" end="01:37:06.510" style="s2">illegal activities will take place so</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.409" end="01:37:08.420" style="s2">the first thing about zoning is it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.510" end="01:37:10.980" style="s2">to be done on a consultative and</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.420" end="01:37:13.110" style="s2">collegial and some collegial is the</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.980" end="01:37:14.969" style="s2">wrong word collaborative way and</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.110" end="01:37:17.550" style="s2">bringing stakeholders together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.969" end="01:37:19.949" style="s2">essential otherwise there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.550" end="01:37:23.460" style="s2">ways around owning the second thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.949" end="01:37:26.659" style="s2">about zoning is if there are economic</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.460" end="01:37:29.370" style="s2">trade-offs one has to look at that</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.659" end="01:37:31.350" style="s2">carefully because there may be ways to</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.370" end="01:37:33.300" style="s2">avoid them and if you don&#39;t look at the</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.350" end="01:37:35.070" style="s2">economics carefully then you can do</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.300" end="01:37:37.620" style="s2">really dumb things with economic zone</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.070" end="01:37:39.780" style="s2">the third thing is if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.620" end="01:37:43.170" style="s2">make an assertion like we have both made</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.780" end="01:37:45.960" style="s2">tonight that we think MPAs which is a</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.170" end="01:37:48.230" style="s2">type of zoning can be helpful in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.960" end="01:37:50.310" style="s2">overall issue of fisheries management</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.230" end="01:37:51.900" style="s2">eventually maybe we can get away with</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.310" end="01:37:53.760" style="s2">saying that for a number of years maybe</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.900" end="01:37:55.409" style="s2">even decades eventually we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.760" end="01:37:57.239" style="s2">show the results so there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.409" end="01:38:00.120" style="s2">lot of monitoring and so forth as well</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.239" end="01:38:03.179" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s your word against my word</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.120" end="01:38:05.969" style="s2">so to speak and so so those are some of</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.179" end="01:38:08.159" style="s2">the consequences on the positive side if</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.969" end="01:38:10.790" style="s2">you do things right with zoning you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.159" end="01:38:13.710" style="s2">actually get added value you can have</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.790" end="01:38:17.270" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.710" end="01:38:20.450" style="s2">there&#39;s full-page ad in the paper</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.270" end="01:38:22.250" style="s2">in in British Columbia I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.450" end="01:38:24.770" style="s2">probably in a number of the papers by a</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.250" end="01:38:30.650" style="s2">group of people engaged in marine</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.770" end="01:38:33.200" style="s2">tourism on the discovery some area which</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.650" end="01:38:35.810" style="s2">is up the coast of little ways and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.200" end="01:38:37.640" style="s2">point was in this case that they feared</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.810" end="01:38:40.160" style="s2">a bunch of clear-cutting that was going</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.640" end="01:38:41.719" style="s2">to totally destroy or largely destroy</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.160" end="01:38:45.560" style="s2">the potential for tourism</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.719" end="01:38:49.010" style="s2">so you zone that you don&#39;t let that</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.560" end="01:38:51.260" style="s2">happen or do you just let it happen well</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.010" end="01:38:53.719" style="s2">they&#39;ve got the rights to their cutting</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.260" end="01:38:55.430" style="s2">and the people are saying well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.719" end="01:38:56.750" style="s2">gonna lose our livelihoods people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.430" end="01:39:00.560" style="s2">going to want to come up and see clear</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.750" end="01:39:02.060" style="s2">cuts so those are things that if you do</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.560" end="01:39:05.390" style="s2">get together you have this probably a</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.060" end="01:39:07.700" style="s2">good solution and everybody gives at the</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.390" end="01:39:09.440" style="s2">end of the day but there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.700" end="01:39:11.239" style="s2">solution it&#39;s the same as that example</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.440" end="01:39:13.100" style="s2">between that I gave of the whales going</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.239" end="01:39:15.230" style="s2">and avoiding that ship collisions for</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.100" end="01:39:16.910" style="s2">years there was resistance again you</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.230" end="01:39:18.080" style="s2">know there&#39;s gonna be ships crashing</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.910" end="01:39:21.110" style="s2">into each other and all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.080" end="01:39:23.270" style="s2">or it won&#39;t work work perfectly so so</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.110" end="01:39:25.330" style="s2">and that was the zoning one so so look</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.270" end="01:39:27.650" style="s2">for the positive side of it and</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.330" end="01:39:33.410" style="s2">anticipate if there are negative things</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.650" end="01:39:34.550" style="s2">can they be addressed yeah just from the</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.410" end="01:39:39.640" style="s2">point of view of an organization like</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.550" end="01:39:41.719" style="s2">fin I think I read that the I you use</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.640" end="01:39:43.520" style="s2">also engaged in a lot of odious</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.719" end="01:39:45.050" style="s2">behaviors that aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.520" end="01:39:47.690" style="s2">related to what you talked about tonight</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.050" end="01:39:49.219" style="s2">ie you know human trafficking yeah drugs</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.690" end="01:39:54.860" style="s2">now that sort of thing and this morning</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.219" end="01:39:57.230" style="s2">in order to help give the issue more</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.860" end="01:39:59.900" style="s2">political prominence is there do you see</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.230" end="01:40:02.150" style="s2">linkage as impossible or possibly</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.900" end="01:40:04.250" style="s2">between this issue and others that</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.150" end="01:40:06.080" style="s2">people that other groups or other people</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.250" end="01:40:08.300" style="s2">make you know sort of considered to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.080" end="01:40:10.670" style="s2">sort of trigger ideas if you understand</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.300" end="01:40:12.710" style="s2">the question yeah so so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.670" end="01:40:15.020" style="s2">given that there are illegal fishing</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.710" end="01:40:17.780" style="s2">activities and that those illegal</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.020" end="01:40:20.390" style="s2">activities spill into other domains of</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.780" end="01:40:20.690" style="s2">illegality like perhaps drug trafficking</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.390" end="01:40:22.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.690" end="01:40:26.260" style="s2">and trafficking are there ways of making</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.760" end="01:40:28.940" style="s2">political capital of those connections</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.260" end="01:40:31.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that the I you you</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.940" end="01:40:32.510" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s relatively new that</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.400" end="01:40:33.980" style="s2">people have been trying to make those</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.510" end="01:40:38.990" style="s2">linkages even though we&#39;ve known that</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.980" end="01:40:41.450" style="s2">there are linkages I think the answer in</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.990" end="01:40:44.300" style="s2">quick answer is yes but it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.450" end="01:40:46.310" style="s2">done very carefully and it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.300" end="01:40:49.340" style="s2">done on them it has to be evidence-based</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.310" end="01:40:51.380" style="s2">and it has to be done not just at a kind</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.340" end="01:40:54.290" style="s2">of a global thinking level or won&#39;t lead</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.380" end="01:40:55.700" style="s2">anywhere it has to be got down to very</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.290" end="01:41:03.230" style="s2">serious things to give you one example</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.700" end="01:41:06.080" style="s2">in the 1980s the fisheries industry in</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.230" end="01:41:08.300" style="s2">the south of Thailand woody went into</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.080" end="01:41:10.190" style="s2">decline and it was fish stocks had been</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.300" end="01:41:14.120" style="s2">over fishing and all they could catch</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.190" end="01:41:16.430" style="s2">for jellyfish and squid so and there was</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.120" end="01:41:18.440" style="s2">a thousands of boats so many of them</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.430" end="01:41:20.330" style="s2">turned into predatory action against the</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.440" end="01:41:22.880" style="s2">Vietnamese refugees coming out of</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.330" end="01:41:26.240" style="s2">Vietnam and it was a terrible situation</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.880" end="01:41:31.850" style="s2">really awful well one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.240" end="01:41:33.200" style="s2">happened was that Thailand which was</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.850" end="01:41:33.920" style="s2">very concerned and the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.200" end="01:41:36.290" style="s2">was as well</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.920" end="01:41:39.170" style="s2">but I decided that they would take on</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.290" end="01:41:41.900" style="s2">the function of turning the this past</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.170" end="01:41:44.120" style="s2">industry into a processing industry for</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.900" end="01:41:46.310" style="s2">the world&#39;s tuna and successfully</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.120" end="01:41:48.920" style="s2">managed to build a whole new industrial</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.310" end="01:41:50.480" style="s2">basis around taking frozen tuna from</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.920" end="01:41:52.340" style="s2">everywhere in the world so if you look</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.480" end="01:41:54.800" style="s2">at all your canned tuna if you have to</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.340" end="01:41:57.290" style="s2">eat tuna or they that you&#39;ll find most</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.800" end="01:41:59.930" style="s2">of its but not Camden and Thailand ever</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.290" end="01:42:02.810" style="s2">since so it created a new industry that</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.930" end="01:42:05.270" style="s2">at least picked up some of the jobs and</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.810" end="01:42:07.190" style="s2">got out of a lot of the illegal other</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.270" end="01:42:09.050" style="s2">activities and and including a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.190" end="01:42:11.010" style="s2">the illegal fisheries activities because</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.050" end="01:42:13.200" style="s2">the Thais were also going off into it</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.010" end="01:42:15.930" style="s2">waters and elsewhere and just savaging</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.200" end="01:42:18.480" style="s2">this fish dogs their insurance dogs and</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.930" end="01:42:18.960" style="s2">so forth so there can be solutions to</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.480" end="01:42:23.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.960" end="01:42:26.460" style="s2">I think the on this I you you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.040" end="01:42:29.430" style="s2">a huge issue FAO has been very useful on</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.460" end="01:42:32.250" style="s2">it and a lot of countries are now buying</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.430" end="01:42:34.410" style="s2">in very in a very good way including</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.250" end="01:42:37.050" style="s2">many developing nations I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.410" end="01:42:39.150" style="s2">making progress on it but is a long way</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.050" end="01:42:41.190" style="s2">to go still and so anything that can</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.150" end="01:42:42.540" style="s2">link it to the other illegal activities</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.190" end="01:42:59.220" style="s2">some of which are very odious to</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.540" end="01:43:01.110" style="s2">countries that would be helpful the</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.220" end="01:43:03.480" style="s2">question is whether aggressive action</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.110" end="01:43:05.670" style="s2">like that of the sea shepherd can be</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.480" end="01:43:08.490" style="s2">productive or whether overall that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.670" end="01:43:09.450" style="s2">counterproductive well I have a personal</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.490" end="01:43:12.390" style="s2">view on this</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.450" end="01:43:13.980" style="s2">my personal view which is I think agreed</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.390" end="01:43:16.590" style="s2">upon by at least some of my colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.980" end="01:43:19.590" style="s2">not everybody is that we need a number</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.590" end="01:43:24.450" style="s2">of different it is a war that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.590" end="01:43:27.450" style="s2">fought and sea Shepherd is is fighting</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.450" end="01:43:30.990" style="s2">actively on some fronts where others</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.450" end="01:43:32.400" style="s2">fear to go but we need people who are on</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.990" end="01:43:35.070" style="s2">the Front&#39;s whether it&#39;s Greenpeace</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.400" end="01:43:36.720" style="s2">whether its Sea Shepherd whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.070" end="01:43:39.930" style="s2">people who are milder in their actions</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.720" end="01:43:42.210" style="s2">but still for example in the case of</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.930" end="01:43:44.580" style="s2">Sierra Club know taking harder stance</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.210" end="01:43:49.530" style="s2">and decided which might include some</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.580" end="01:43:51.150" style="s2">actions going on ramming ships or</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.530" end="01:43:55.020" style="s2">whatever the sea shepherd has been</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.150" end="01:43:58.050" style="s2">accused of I think that there&#39;s a a wide</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.020" end="01:44:00.660" style="s2">spectrum how things are needed some of</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.050" end="01:44:04.710" style="s2">which are in that far end and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.660" end="01:44:08.760" style="s2">not I don&#39;t want people to be injured in</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.710" end="01:44:11.520" style="s2">the process but they&#39;re making a point</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.760" end="01:44:14.220" style="s2">in a dramatic way that that</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.520" end="01:44:19.110" style="s2">you know and others cannot make then</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.220" end="01:44:21.750" style="s2">there are the people that that go out</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.110" end="01:44:24.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of them go out and make</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.750" end="01:44:27.600" style="s2">movies they go out and do active</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.660" end="01:44:29.250" style="s2">research with money that&#39;s raised for</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.600" end="01:44:31.470" style="s2">their cause and the many of the NGOs</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.250" end="01:44:33.150" style="s2">fallenness and so they&#39;re not going that</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.470" end="01:44:35.490" style="s2">far but they&#39;re still they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.150" end="01:44:36.810" style="s2">activists highly activists and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.490" end="01:44:39.150" style="s2">going out and they&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.810" end="01:44:41.960" style="s2">problems locally and internationally and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.150" end="01:44:44.370" style="s2">so forth and and they&#39;re valuable</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.960" end="01:44:47.610" style="s2">there&#39;s people like myself that have</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.370" end="01:44:50.370" style="s2">chosen to work closer to government but</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.610" end="01:44:52.920" style="s2">I mean I&#39;d like to believe that I</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.370" end="01:44:54.630" style="s2">understand some things about science and</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.920" end="01:44:58.530" style="s2">I want to see that translated into</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.630" end="01:45:00.900" style="s2">public policy if I ever went out and did</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.530" end="01:45:02.220" style="s2">something like Sea Shepherd&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.900" end="01:45:04.260" style="s2">certainly wouldn&#39;t be welcome in some of</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.220" end="01:45:05.970" style="s2">the circles that I travel in with with</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.260" end="01:45:07.380" style="s2">government people or whatever so you</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.970" end="01:45:11.130" style="s2">make choices and then there are</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.380" end="01:45:13.740" style="s2">scientists that often want to remain</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.130" end="01:45:16.440" style="s2">very close to their science whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.740" end="01:45:18.660" style="s2">happens to be and would prefer to bring</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.440" end="01:45:20.640" style="s2">that information freely and well out to</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.660" end="01:45:22.950" style="s2">the public and so forth but not be the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.640" end="01:45:25.740" style="s2">front liners themselves and and so and</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.950" end="01:45:27.780" style="s2">then there&#39;s others as well I also</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.740" end="01:45:29.700" style="s2">believe in the power of one you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.780" end="01:45:32.850" style="s2">individuals like the schoolteacher and</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.700" end="01:45:34.860" style="s2">the whales in Nova Scotia that was just</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.850" end="01:45:38.100" style="s2">an ordinary school teacher in a small</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.860" end="01:45:40.470" style="s2">rural school district who did something</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.100" end="01:45:43.620" style="s2">that was really very very valuable at</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.470" end="01:45:45.240" style="s2">the time and and we can find many other</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.620" end="01:45:48.960" style="s2">examples I could tell you dozens of</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.240" end="01:45:51.420" style="s2">stories there&#39;s people there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.960" end="01:45:53.550" style="s2">organization that deals with fisheries</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.420" end="01:45:55.170" style="s2">management I&#39;m a collective sort of</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.550" end="01:45:57.750" style="s2">basis in the west coast of Vancouver</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.170" end="01:45:59.880" style="s2">Island and they stick their necks out</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.750" end="01:46:03.750" style="s2">they work collectively between First</p>

<p begin="01:46:03.750" end="01:46:06.960" style="s2">provincial is supported from a variety</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.430" end="01:46:08.940" style="s2">of different source and they manage a</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.960" end="01:46:11.160" style="s2">lot of species that are not the big</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.940" end="01:46:13.350" style="s2">flashy of salmon or so forth but other</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.160" end="01:46:15.390" style="s2">things and they&#39;re making progress in</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.350" end="01:46:15.929" style="s2">setting the basis for a new form of</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.390" end="01:46:17.969" style="s2">fisheries</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.929" end="01:46:19.139" style="s2">management and and it&#39;s tough let me</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.969" end="01:46:20.429" style="s2">tell you how tough of this oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.139" end="01:46:24.539" style="s2">because I&#39;ve looked at this organization</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.429" end="01:46:28.079" style="s2">quite closely and and so we need people</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.539" end="01:46:29.639" style="s2">that are activists in different ways we</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.079" end="01:46:32.789" style="s2">need people that are educators we need</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.639" end="01:46:36.449" style="s2">researchers the whole range so I I do</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.789" end="01:46:39.059" style="s2">think I must admit that I have a higher</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.449" end="01:46:43.050" style="s2">degree of respect for Paul Watson then</p>

<p begin="01:46:45.630" end="01:47:13.170" style="s2">some very very dark corners how we could</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.150" end="01:47:14.639" style="s2">reduce this because you know quality is</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.170" end="01:47:16.670" style="s2">an important aspect so you can I guess</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.639" end="01:47:20.309" style="s2">you could take an individual to a farm</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.420" end="01:47:52.139" style="s2">can be done to link these issues to</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.189" end="01:47:57.229" style="s2">behavior at a at a local level you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.139" end="01:47:57.229" style="s2">that something project that you have</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.780" end="01:48:05.729" style="s2">because this is an intellectual talk</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.369" end="01:48:08.360" style="s2">I&#39;ll say and I can&#39;t really voice this</p>

<p begin="01:48:09.699" end="01:48:16.010" style="s2">well the only the only real effective</p>

<p begin="01:48:16.010" end="01:48:21.350" style="s2">that I think would actually work is for</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.650" end="01:48:24.170" style="s2">people to write their MPs and members of</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.350" end="01:48:25.909" style="s2">the cabinet because believe it or not</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.170" end="01:48:29.030" style="s2">politicians actually pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.909" end="01:48:30.739" style="s2">letters and so a lot of what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.030" end="01:48:32.960" style="s2">talked about tonight especially the</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.739" end="01:48:35.060" style="s2">marine protected areas issue isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.960" end="01:48:36.679" style="s2">to be moved forward unless the</p>

<p begin="01:48:36.679" end="01:48:39.890" style="s2">public demand like the frameworks</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.540" end="01:48:41.780" style="s2">already there right they&#39;ve signed the</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.890" end="01:48:44.030" style="s2">treaties and so on but the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.780" end="01:48:47.600" style="s2">reading the population is it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.030" end="01:48:49.489" style="s2">okay to ignore that and the only way to</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.600" end="01:48:52.280" style="s2">change that as far as I can tell is to</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.489" end="01:48:54.530" style="s2">indicate that it&#39;s actually not okay to</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.280" end="01:48:57.230" style="s2">ignore it because right now it is okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.530" end="01:48:59.690" style="s2">and and that&#39;s not good our political</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.230" end="01:49:01.460" style="s2">system actually does work it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.690" end="01:49:04.699" style="s2">permeable than people really think</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.460" end="01:49:06.830" style="s2">because in some ways it&#39;s left to its</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.699" end="01:49:08.300" style="s2">own devices you know most people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:49:08.300" end="01:49:13.550" style="s2">system so it leaves it in the hands of</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.550" end="01:49:15.500" style="s2">the very small minority who do but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.550" end="01:49:18.440" style="s2">surprisingly permeable if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.500" end="01:49:19.820" style="s2">interested in permeating it in so well</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.440" end="01:49:22.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s why I take at least out</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.820" end="01:49:24.560" style="s2">the political that&#39;s one let let me give</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.820" end="01:49:28.159" style="s2">you four or five things that I think are</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.560" end="01:49:30.530" style="s2">really useful one is if you have the</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.159" end="01:49:34.040" style="s2">trust in them these seafood guides are</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.530" end="01:49:36.050" style="s2">very helpful and so you can use those in</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.040" end="01:49:40.250" style="s2">your own personal life if you go into a</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.050" end="01:49:43.670" style="s2">restaurant ask them Hess&#39;s and if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.250" end="01:49:45.409" style="s2">happen to enjoy fish ask them tell me</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.670" end="01:49:50.150" style="s2">about this fish what is the species</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.409" end="01:49:52.790" style="s2">where was it captured from what is it</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.150" end="01:49:54.440" style="s2">certified fish that you&#39;re serving ask</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.790" end="01:49:57.800" style="s2">the chef to come out and talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.440" end="01:50:01.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve done that and and and go in if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.800" end="01:50:03.199" style="s2">use an iPad or an iPhone and challenge</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.850" end="01:50:05.300" style="s2">them on some things when they say they</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.199" end="01:50:08.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know they do is no information and</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.300" end="01:50:10.100" style="s2">then I did this once in a very</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.330" end="01:50:11.540" style="s2">respectable restaurant in Vancouver and</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.100" end="01:50:13.219" style="s2">I warned them I said look I&#39;m bringing a</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.540" end="01:50:14.719" style="s2">group of people who are leaders in this</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.219" end="01:50:16.460" style="s2">whole seafood process they&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.719" end="01:50:17.390" style="s2">all sorts of questions so I brought my</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.460" end="01:50:19.520" style="s2">iPad</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.390" end="01:50:22.550" style="s2">those days and disco up six months</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.520" end="01:50:25.520" style="s2">before and and we sat down half an hour</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.550" end="01:50:26.930" style="s2">uh-huh by the time the the poor chefs</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.520" end="01:50:28.700" style="s2">were sweating a little tired but they</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.930" end="01:50:30.680" style="s2">answered all the questions correctly we</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.700" end="01:50:32.840" style="s2">got all the information and we got past</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.680" end="01:50:34.910" style="s2">all these fancy names and so forth so</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.840" end="01:50:36.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what another way in dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.910" end="01:50:39.290" style="s2">the food industry do it at a supermarket</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.890" end="01:50:41.810" style="s2">if you&#39;re not getting good answers write</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.290" end="01:50:44.000" style="s2">to the president of the company and say</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.810" end="01:50:46.670" style="s2">you know I was in whatever change</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.000" end="01:50:48.710" style="s2">happened to be local or national and and</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.670" end="01:50:50.810" style="s2">I could not get any answer above whether</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.710" end="01:50:53.090" style="s2">the crab that you&#39;re serving was</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.810" end="01:50:56.270" style="s2">sustainably produced can you tell me and</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.090" end="01:50:58.220" style="s2">if they can&#39;t go after them and say</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.270" end="01:50:59.660" style="s2">please I really want to know an honest</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.220" end="01:51:02.360" style="s2">answer but I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re the answer</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.660" end="01:51:05.300" style="s2">and you&#39;ll make your decisions and a</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.360" end="01:51:06.860" style="s2">third way is as you say go to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.300" end="01:51:09.140" style="s2">politicians and keep going to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.860" end="01:51:11.510" style="s2">politicians find out who the politicians</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.140" end="01:51:13.370" style="s2">locally are that really have an interest</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.510" end="01:51:15.260" style="s2">in the subject because there are little</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.370" end="01:51:17.330" style="s2">clusters of people that don&#39;t get very</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.260" end="01:51:19.190" style="s2">much support in both the Senate and in</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.330" end="01:51:20.750" style="s2">the house that really are interested and</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.190" end="01:51:23.780" style="s2">they cross party lines and some of these</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.750" end="01:51:26.360" style="s2">things as well and that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.780" end="01:51:28.370" style="s2">doing it but gorgeous I think that</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.360" end="01:51:33.560" style="s2">unsustainable development in general we</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.370" end="01:51:35.630" style="s2">have to go to the city&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.560" end="01:51:37.880" style="s2">system right now how much this would</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.630" end="01:51:40.160" style="s2">come up to the dog but I know certainly</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.880" end="01:51:41.840" style="s2">in the West Coast and I think in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.160" end="01:51:43.640" style="s2">of places in the East Coast it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.840" end="01:51:45.650" style="s2">central people will talk about it to you</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.640" end="01:51:48.880" style="s2">and they are the places where action is</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.650" end="01:51:53.150" style="s2">taking taking on interesting approaches</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.880" end="01:51:55.940" style="s2">the next one is to figure out and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.150" end="01:51:58.010" style="s2">can only do this yourself by looking at</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.940" end="01:51:59.780" style="s2">different organizations decide which</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.010" end="01:52:02.270" style="s2">organizations you&#39;re going to support</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.780" end="01:52:03.620" style="s2">and support them in ways that just may</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.270" end="01:52:06.440" style="s2">be giving them some money from time to</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.620" end="01:52:08.150" style="s2">time but ask how you can help because it</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.440" end="01:52:10.340" style="s2">just to give you a couple examples World</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.150" end="01:52:12.350" style="s2">Wildlife Fund Canadian parks and</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.340" end="01:52:15.770" style="s2">wilderness Society both have excellent</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.350" end="01:52:17.870" style="s2">excellent people that need support you</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.770" end="01:52:20.570" style="s2">know and not just money but they need</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.870" end="01:52:22.790" style="s2">people behind them in various ways and</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.570" end="01:52:26.270" style="s2">in this very sensitive and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.790" end="01:52:29.740" style="s2">finally if you have children will</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.270" end="01:52:33.380" style="s2">children or whatever work with kids kids</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.740" end="01:52:37.850" style="s2">genuinely want to do things better they</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.380" end="01:52:39.530" style="s2">understand kids well I was a bit</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.850" end="01:52:44.030" style="s2">insulted about that fish that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.530" end="01:52:48.260" style="s2">chosen but I thought its kind of cute</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.030" end="01:52:50.660" style="s2">myself but but the important point is</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.260" end="01:52:53.030" style="s2">that kids love whales our little</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.660" end="01:52:55.460" style="s2">granddaughter was eight years old she</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.030" end="01:52:57.620" style="s2">proudly announces oh I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.460" end="01:52:59.840" style="s2">research project on the Pacific dolphin</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.620" end="01:53:01.610" style="s2">and by the time she finished that thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.840" end="01:53:04.310" style="s2">she knew a lot about Pacific dolphins</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.610" end="01:53:06.560" style="s2">help people that way you know get at</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.310" end="01:53:08.810" style="s2">young people young people who really</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.560" end="01:53:10.580" style="s2">want to because they they are upset by</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.810" end="01:53:12.440" style="s2">these things they see it there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.580" end="01:53:14.690" style="s2">of stuff on television that and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.440" end="01:53:16.820" style="s2">the internet and they&#39;re getting done</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.690" end="01:53:18.470" style="s2">that there&#39;s a problem and they happen</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.820" end="01:53:20.810" style="s2">to love these things they love dolphins</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.470" end="01:53:23.300" style="s2">they love seals and they miss out on the</p>

<p begin="01:53:23.300" end="01:53:29.960" style="s2">understand why these things are in</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.340" end="01:53:31.520" style="s2">trouble or the fish so those are some</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.960" end="01:53:33.620" style="s2">concrete ways that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.520" end="01:53:35.660" style="s2">address this and keep that and their</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.620" end="01:53:37.370" style="s2">list in mind as you move ahead with spin</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.660" end="01:53:40.280" style="s2">as well because I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.370" end="01:53:41.540" style="s2">important question we I&#39;m talking and we</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.280" end="01:53:44.510" style="s2">all are talking that may be a bit</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.540" end="01:53:47.030" style="s2">abstractly here but in each case you can</p>
