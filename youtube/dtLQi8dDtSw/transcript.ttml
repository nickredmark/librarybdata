<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">to notice it but I&#39;d say that trust</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">legitimate trust is the most precious</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:43.460" style="s2">resource in a society and many of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:46.220" style="s2">may know that in the Analects of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">Confucius it&#39;s reported that he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.220" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">asked what are the absolutely essential</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:05.030" style="s2">function in peace and he said the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">essentials come down to three things the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.030" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">military military or a police force is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">needed food people have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:21.610" style="s2">eat and trust and so at that point his</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:24.169" style="s2">disciples said well what would happen if</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.610" end="00:05:28.419" style="s2">you had to let go which is not enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.169" end="00:05:31.490" style="s2">though if you couldn&#39;t half of all free</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.419" end="00:05:34.850" style="s2">medical there&#39;s one which would it be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.490" end="00:05:36.110" style="s2">and he said well of course that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.850" end="00:05:37.790" style="s2">very difficult but under those</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.110" end="00:05:40.940" style="s2">circumstances one would have to dispense</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.790" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">with the military with the police force</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.940" end="00:05:53.690" style="s2">the the forces that that maintain order</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:56.090" style="s2">and so then another courageous disciple</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.690" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">asked okay so now we have trust in food</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.090" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">what if you had to lose one of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">which one would you drop if you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">have both of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:08.150" style="s2">and he said well of course it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:10.810" style="s2">difficult but under those circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">you&#39;d have to dispense with food and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.810" end="00:06:19.460" style="s2">only have trust there&#39;s nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:21.979" style="s2">important than trust and even if your</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.620" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">over this huge Empire obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.260" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">impossible well it happened and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:47.000" style="s2">happened quickly it happened in a matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:48.260" style="s2">of generations and if you ask me what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.000" end="00:18:52.789" style="s2">happened well the thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.260" end="00:18:55.700" style="s2">was they told a better story the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.789" end="00:18:58.549" style="s2">Christians told a very good story it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.700" end="00:19:00.950" style="s2">a brilliant story they took aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.549" end="00:19:03.880" style="s2">stories from the Jewish tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.950" end="00:19:07.070" style="s2">course very importantly aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.880" end="00:19:07.790" style="s2">greco-roman tradition like that like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.070" end="00:19:09.650" style="s2">hero</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.790" end="00:19:12.370" style="s2">you know Jesus is a hero half god and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.650" end="00:19:14.169" style="s2">half human a god and a human had a baby</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.370" end="00:19:17.320" style="s2">so it had special powers like Hercules</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.169" end="00:19:19.240" style="s2">and such and so there was this feast and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.320" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">there was and then he died for your sins</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.240" end="00:19:26.650" style="s2">is amazing brilliant story taking from</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.100" end="00:19:29.220" style="s2">the various traditions of the time a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.650" end="00:19:33.510" style="s2">better story than anyone else told and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.220" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">that it that was the end doses of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.510" end="00:19:39.490" style="s2">forgotten for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:47.020" style="s2">Christianity took over the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.490" end="00:19:51.220" style="s2">and I fail this because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.020" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">highest goals that it&#39;s that we have in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.220" end="00:19:55.899" style="s2">a meaning crisis at a time like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:58.630" style="s2">when every went when if you look around</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.899" end="00:20:02.039" style="s2">what I see is a very is a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.630" end="00:20:05.140" style="s2">consistent tendency for various groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.039" end="00:20:07.390" style="s2">to just criticize to just demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.140" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">the untrustworthy nature of the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.390" end="00:20:12.700" style="s2">groups so in this country Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:18.520" style="s2">Republicans in general conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.700" end="00:20:19.929" style="s2">liberals uh various people looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.520" end="00:20:21.279" style="s2">the environment in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.929" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">various people looking at human</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.279" end="00:20:27.340" style="s2">development in different ways there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:29.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong tendency to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.340" end="00:20:35.799" style="s2">why the other side is untrustworthy is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.799" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">wrong or evil uh but it&#39;s very hard for</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.799" end="00:20:40.120" style="s2">us right now to come up with a story</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">with a narrative with an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.120" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">with meaning that is both accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">effective at bringing people together</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.140" end="00:20:57.100" style="s2">this is extremely hard and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:21:00.630" style="s2">actually the one of the main you might</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.100" end="00:21:06.100" style="s2">even say the main goal that we have here</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.630" end="00:21:08.260" style="s2">we wanted to create people who have done</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.100" end="00:21:12.130" style="s2">the personal works so that they can work</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.260" end="00:21:14.279" style="s2">together as a community to tell a better</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.130" end="00:21:14.279" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.770" end="00:21:20.230" style="s2">because right now there is a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.360" end="00:21:22.660" style="s2">vacuum and there is a trust vacuum and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.230" end="00:21:27.010" style="s2">if there were ever a time when we needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.660" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">trustworthy leadership and it put faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.010" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">in so that we could find meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:36.790" style="s2">collective action it is now on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:38.170" style="s2">planet I&#39;ve been terrified of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.790" end="00:21:42.130" style="s2">existential threats facing the planet</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.170" end="00:21:44.530" style="s2">since I was a kid and well by the time I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.130" end="00:21:47.590" style="s2">was eight I understood these issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.530" end="00:21:49.750" style="s2">global warming and nuclear terminal</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.590" end="00:21:50.920" style="s2">nuclear war and an eight-year-old can</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">understand these things it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.920" end="00:21:56.980" style="s2">complicated and yet we cannot bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.180" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">ourselves to function as a group</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.980" end="00:22:00.580" style="s2">effectively in the way that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:03.880" style="s2">around this other thing so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.580" end="00:22:10.750" style="s2">but this virus where the world has come</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.880" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">together and been on nurse sauce uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.750" end="00:22:17.800" style="s2">been very hard for us and I am</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.930" end="00:22:20.680" style="s2">attempting to rule people together so</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.800" end="00:22:26.310" style="s2">that we can tell a story that people can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.680" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">respond to that that is because they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.310" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">made up stories are made up but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:34.750" style="s2">will guide us to that which is not made</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:37.390" style="s2">up so that we can live in harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.750" end="00:22:39.700" style="s2">it you might call it nature or you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.390" end="00:22:44.140" style="s2">call it any number of other things the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.700" end="00:22:45.910" style="s2">Dharma or something but that we can find</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.140" end="00:22:49.290" style="s2">that and then learn how to tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.910" end="00:22:55.750" style="s2">that brings people into harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:57.370" style="s2">that on a vast scale that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.750" end="00:23:00.430" style="s2">working on and as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.370" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing more effective at</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.430" end="00:23:06.870" style="s2">solving the problems of the world than</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:12.040" style="s2">that and so we throw our lives into it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.870" end="00:23:17.260" style="s2">so that was about 25 minutes yes is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.040" end="00:23:20.050" style="s2">perfect timing and so do you think Peter</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.260" end="00:23:22.540" style="s2">that there&#39;s anything you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.050" end="00:23:25.330" style="s2">would clarify some of that or yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.540" end="00:23:27.550" style="s2">I got some stuff for you well I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">you have a little vertical dance just</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.550" end="00:23:31.750" style="s2">right there your questions in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">boxing will call on you and when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.750" end="00:23:35.049" style="s2">were talking about stoicism I was sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:41.650" style="s2">of playfully trash-talking you in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.049" end="00:23:43.809" style="s2">chat and what am I really yes so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.650" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">read you one I said I love this guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.809" end="00:23:54.039" style="s2">comes to the store and takes shots at</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:57.220" style="s2">the Stoics so I have a few questions one</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.039" end="00:24:01.270" style="s2">of them is do you think yeah I know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.220" end="00:24:04.570" style="s2">know I would say too good of a job the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.270" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">Buddhism was the same way both both I</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.570" end="00:24:11.140" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">we&#39;re so accurate that then it became</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:18.130" style="s2">very hard to be delusional but actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:19.929" style="s2">that&#39;s the planning is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.130" end="00:24:22.360" style="s2">certain compassion in being delusional</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.929" end="00:24:25.809" style="s2">if you have the ability to not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.360" end="00:24:27.789" style="s2">delusional hmm so the question is kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.809" end="00:24:29.860" style="s2">of life for me is do you think it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.789" end="00:24:35.020" style="s2">do you think it could ever be wise to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.860" end="00:24:40.299" style="s2">tell a bad story but it everybody no</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.020" end="00:24:42.580" style="s2">buzzer I think so yes sadly but yes and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.299" end="00:24:44.980" style="s2">I guess the follow-up question is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.580" end="00:24:49.690" style="s2">do you think a bad story could set up a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.980" end="00:24:55.630" style="s2">good story yeah exactly what do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.690" end="00:24:58.150" style="s2">think yes see yeah I think I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.630" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">want to tell us the goal is to tell a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.150" end="00:25:08.309" style="s2">story at the edge the very edge so as as</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:10.440" style="s2">good of a story as possible we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.309" end="00:25:14.380" style="s2">we&#39;re good enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:16.090" style="s2">all right a good enough story yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.380" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">talk about good enough parents right</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.090" end="00:25:21.429" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like that you want to tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:23.020" style="s2">it good enough story and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.429" end="00:25:24.370" style="s2">have to give yourself that leeway or</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.020" end="00:25:27.669" style="s2">else you&#39;re not going to allow yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.370" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">to make mistakes and and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.669" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">dangerous place to put oneself in so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:35.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of my questions I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:37.659" style="s2">ask you more of course but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.580" end="00:25:39.490" style="s2">smarter people in the room right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.659" end="00:25:42.130" style="s2">that could ask better questions so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.490" end="00:25:47.020" style="s2">gonna take in Benito Roy I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.130" end="00:25:49.830" style="s2">you have my question Anita Wow hi where</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.020" end="00:25:53.730" style="s2">are you I don&#39;t see you anywhere maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.830" end="00:25:53.730" style="s2">maybe she didn&#39;t have a question she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.550" end="00:26:07.720" style="s2">so a couple questions but the first one</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.890" end="00:26:08.500" style="s2">when you were talking is like you know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.720" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">teach I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.500" end="00:26:20.050" style="s2">I teach a lot of people and quite often</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">like what comes up is that once we get</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.050" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">down to the brass tacks of things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">my cohort will say or divulge or reveal</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">that there that actually proud to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:39.460" style="s2">humans you know really because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:41.890" style="s2">destroying everything yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.460" end="00:26:45.580" style="s2">seems to be a partial truth to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.890" end="00:26:48.130" style="s2">yeah although when you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.580" end="00:26:59.640" style="s2">depths of it it seems to be the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.130" end="00:26:59.640" style="s2">truth so how do you speak to that person</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.820" end="00:27:12.280" style="s2">no just a sense of like like how can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.930" end="00:27:15.040" style="s2">trust that the humans like what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.280" end="00:27:19.390" style="s2">people for like how can you trust that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.040" end="00:27:20.590" style="s2">people have an intimate participation</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.390" end="00:27:24.160" style="s2">with reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.590" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">you know I know right in the face of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.160" end="00:27:30.370" style="s2">this evidence that&#39;s not true so where</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:34.650" style="s2">does that come from and how does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.370" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">express itself I know a big question but</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.650" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">big question but you know me well enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.380" end="00:27:46.630" style="s2">okay so I guess I&#39;ll just answer how</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:50.110" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.630" end="00:27:54.190" style="s2">good cuz I don&#39;t know well I mean I get</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.110" end="00:27:58.040" style="s2">into Burma of my life uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.190" end="00:28:00.410" style="s2">so as I think you know as a child I</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.040" end="00:28:03.080" style="s2">asked this question and concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.410" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">people are just not trustworthy and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.080" end="00:28:09.050" style="s2">there&#39;s only one ethical loving</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">compassionate thing to do with one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.050" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">life are you familiar with this oh we</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:16.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about this um so for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">those of you know Bonilla and I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.120" end="00:28:24.020" style="s2">been together a few times and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">vented together and in communication and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.020" end="00:28:30.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a great privilege for me to see you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">present and to connect with you so often</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.740" end="00:28:34.730" style="s2">I feel very grateful</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:39.610" style="s2">I guess they haven&#39;t talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.730" end="00:28:43.190" style="s2">so as a kid I thought about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.610" end="00:28:49.280" style="s2">concluded that the only rational and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.190" end="00:28:53.420" style="s2">compassionate act that I could take was</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.280" end="00:28:56.050" style="s2">to kill all the humans there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.420" end="00:28:58.010" style="s2">nothing better to do with one&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.050" end="00:29:02.300" style="s2">then kill the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.010" end="00:29:04.580" style="s2">and so I because because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.300" end="00:29:07.700" style="s2">most of the evil on the planet comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.580" end="00:29:09.170" style="s2">from and so it&#39;s best if we make the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.700" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">world a better place I want to make the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.170" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">world a better place and so I decide to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">kill the people and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.789" end="00:29:24.470" style="s2">done that for a number of years actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.019" end="00:29:28.460" style="s2">and pen next you know disease is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.470" end="00:29:31.519" style="s2">actually a pretty good option seemed I</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.460" end="00:29:33.950" style="s2">had the sense I was twelve thirteen</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.519" end="00:29:36.499" style="s2">fourteen at the sense that there was</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.950" end="00:29:38.269" style="s2">that probably as technology improved</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.499" end="00:29:40.700" style="s2">there might be ways of developing such a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.269" end="00:29:42.529" style="s2">sickness it&#39;s very difficult actually to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.700" end="00:29:48.229" style="s2">develop any sickness that wipes out an</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.529" end="00:29:50.090" style="s2">entire species the the incidences of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.229" end="00:29:55.159" style="s2">this and all of my history actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.090" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">extremely rare but I thought perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.159" end="00:30:00.979" style="s2">could and so I I researched that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">extensively along with other methods as</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.979" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">well and yet the question that you asked</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:30.019" style="s2">kept finding me it kept I couldn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.259" end="00:30:31.820" style="s2">wasn&#39;t absolutely certain that killing</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.019" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">everyone was the right thing to do there</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.820" end="00:30:37.909" style="s2">soon very likely but it wasn&#39;t certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:39.940" style="s2">and so partially because of that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.909" end="00:30:43.960" style="s2">partially because of big technical</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.940" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">barriers to actually pulling this off</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.960" end="00:30:48.529" style="s2">because I had to do it alone that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:50.989" style="s2">actually the main issue I didn&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.529" end="00:30:56.749" style="s2">humans enough to work with them and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.989" end="00:30:59.269" style="s2">it was it was there&#39;s a lonely journey</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.749" end="00:31:02.450" style="s2">and it became difficult to do enough on</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.269" end="00:31:04.429" style="s2">my own I didn&#39;t know how to make an</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.450" end="00:31:07.970" style="s2">organization for this it was very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.429" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">difficult and how to pull it off so um I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.970" end="00:31:13.119" style="s2">decided to find someone with whom I</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:16.970" style="s2">could actually speak about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.119" end="00:31:18.710" style="s2">ultimately important topic and I had</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.970" end="00:31:22.489" style="s2">tried to talk with a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.710" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">and they just weren&#39;t mature enough to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.489" end="00:31:25.820" style="s2">do it I talked to them and I could see</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">in their eyes that they were afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.820" end="00:31:29.570" style="s2">dying and they&#39;re afraid of me killing</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:32.029" style="s2">their children or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:33.059" style="s2">and and to be honest I was not</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.029" end="00:31:35.299" style="s2">sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.059" end="00:31:40.110" style="s2">I was I found that to be quite immature</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.299" end="00:31:42.029" style="s2">of them but but I did see that they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.110" end="00:31:45.690" style="s2">considering you know calling the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.029" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">authorities so I couldn&#39;t talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.690" end="00:31:49.889" style="s2">about it so I needed to talk to someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:58.139" style="s2">it was a lonely teenaged period for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.889" end="00:32:02.309" style="s2">when I was 19 or 18 actually I I told my</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.139" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">parents I got it I got a leaf I need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.309" end="00:32:10.529" style="s2">do something else and so I left school</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:11.970" style="s2">and I went to Japan I had traveled quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.529" end="00:32:14.730" style="s2">a bit and eventually was in Japan and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.970" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">met someone with whom I could discuss</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.730" end="00:32:20.580" style="s2">this topic I had no there was nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:23.940" style="s2">his eyes or his voice indicated that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.580" end="00:32:26.999" style="s2">was afraid of dying and actually it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.940" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">seemed that if I could just convince him</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.999" end="00:32:31.019" style="s2">that it was right to kill everyone then</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">he would you just be perfectly happy to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.019" end="00:32:36.809" style="s2">help uh so he just want to talk it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:40.649" style="s2">through and I want to talk it through</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.809" end="00:32:49.590" style="s2">once the phone I had someone to connect</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.649" end="00:32:51.149" style="s2">with and and ultimately and so that so</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.590" end="00:32:53.429" style="s2">that was the Zen master at the Zen</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.149" end="00:32:56.129" style="s2">monastery in a Buddhist monastery in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.429" end="00:33:03.299" style="s2">Japan and after a few conversations he</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.129" end="00:33:08.190" style="s2">said something just perfect he said when</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.299" end="00:33:12.929" style="s2">you were young you realized that if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.190" end="00:33:15.169" style="s2">can&#39;t liberate people then you must kill</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.929" end="00:33:15.169" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.389" end="00:33:22.129" style="s2">and that is exactly right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:23.659" style="s2">what I realized and I conclude but then</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.129" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">America I concluded something I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.659" end="00:33:32.419" style="s2">concluded you can&#39;t liberate people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:34.549" style="s2">so if that is true if you can&#39;t liberate</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.419" end="00:33:37.179" style="s2">people then yes the right thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.549" end="00:33:39.980" style="s2">kill the human beings but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.179" end="00:33:42.529" style="s2">that changes everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.980" end="00:33:46.820" style="s2">and especially if you see how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.529" end="00:33:49.309" style="s2">done and you see that actually we it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.820" end="00:33:50.869" style="s2">isn&#39;t just that we isn&#39;t it really</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.309" end="00:33:52.759" style="s2">question whether we can be in harmony</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.869" end="00:33:54.350" style="s2">it&#39;s the question of how long can we be</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.759" end="00:33:56.210" style="s2">out apartment it&#39;s very difficult for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.350" end="00:34:03.739" style="s2">section to turn away from our own nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.210" end="00:34:06.409" style="s2">and then ultimately impossible so uh so</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.739" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">it&#39;s because of that it&#39;s because of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.409" end="00:34:13.250" style="s2">ability to the extent that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:17.169" style="s2">directly see and directly engage with</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.250" end="00:34:22.940" style="s2">what you might call our true nature then</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.169" end="00:34:26.210" style="s2">to that extent we have we can and must</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.940" end="00:34:29.569" style="s2">that is trust and then the challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.210" end="00:34:32.649" style="s2">only how do you bring that out and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.569" end="00:34:35.690" style="s2">benefit the great benefit of this to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.649" end="00:34:37.790" style="s2">was in finally understanding what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.690" end="00:34:43.129" style="s2">really meant when I said we have to kill</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.790" end="00:34:48.429" style="s2">everyone we have to kill the identity</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.129" end="00:34:50.589" style="s2">part of everyone have to kill the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.429" end="00:34:53.329" style="s2">everyone that everyone thinks they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.589" end="00:34:54.980" style="s2">and what does that basically mean well</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.329" end="00:34:58.869" style="s2">one of the things it basically means is</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.980" end="00:35:03.339" style="s2">killing destroying eliminating ending a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.869" end="00:35:06.799" style="s2">starving kicking no ground to stand on</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.339" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">for the aspect of us that honestly</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.799" end="00:35:13.640" style="s2">believes that we are human it actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">really identifies with being a human</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.640" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">being because for me I I trained and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.660" end="00:35:31.010" style="s2">let go of that identity that identity</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.000" end="00:35:31.010" style="s2">and saw that it was artificial and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:42.350" style="s2">morose melancholy SAP and and not true</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.740" end="00:35:45.270" style="s2">and so and so that sense of self that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.350" end="00:35:48.570" style="s2">does have to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.270" end="00:35:50.850" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t only human beings who</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.570" end="00:35:53.970" style="s2">have that we human beings are in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.850" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">special case in a in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.970" end="00:36:05.790" style="s2">because we have a found a way to empower</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:11.970" style="s2">that sense of stuff with very few</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.790" end="00:36:14.220" style="s2">limitations we and in the training that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.970" end="00:36:18.180" style="s2">we do here one of the most significant</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.220" end="00:36:22.310" style="s2">things is in showing people that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.180" end="00:36:27.330" style="s2">the non empowerment of our sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.310" end="00:36:31.020" style="s2">is our own empowerment that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.330" end="00:36:34.230" style="s2">difficult to see it&#39;s a the empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.020" end="00:36:36.300" style="s2">of our self so you know to do what I</p>

<p begin="00:36:36.300" end="00:36:45.450" style="s2">should do this is not freedom this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.080" end="00:36:48.620" style="s2">slavery this is not power this is giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.450" end="00:36:52.650" style="s2">away our power and then things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.620" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">humanism and then you have individualism</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.650" end="00:36:58.290" style="s2">and then you have capitalism and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:37:04.310" style="s2">you have consumerism these various</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.290" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">levels of views are based on but also</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.310" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">reify and reinforce and re empower the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:17.820" style="s2">delusional sense of self and so we here</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:20.580" style="s2">in the training people have to face this</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.820" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">it is so difficult it is it feels so</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.580" end="00:37:28.850" style="s2">threatening to let go of those ways of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:32.180" style="s2">looking things and of those addictions</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.850" end="00:37:34.230" style="s2">to things like thinking and feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.180" end="00:37:36.250" style="s2">it&#39;s so difficult to have faith that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.230" end="00:37:38.170" style="s2">there could be anything beyond that any</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:40.170" style="s2">and in particular I think which brings</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.170" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">us to your question and then to my</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.170" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">exploration as a child the question of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:49.690" style="s2">well what is our true nature is are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">really just so far away that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.690" end="00:37:57.610" style="s2">that we can&#39;t there&#39;s nothing that can</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">be done about it and and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.610" end="00:38:02.680" style="s2">difficult to have faith to trust that if</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:04.510" style="s2">we let and put all of our minds and our</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.680" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">bodies of our thoughts and our feelings</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.510" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2">of our identities or a sense of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:15.700" style="s2">that could be any kind of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.940" end="00:38:19.390" style="s2">beyond that and so the answer is on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:21.370" style="s2">one hand help a person to see that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.390" end="00:38:23.790" style="s2">sense of self and in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.370" end="00:38:27.610" style="s2">sense of being human is delusional and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.790" end="00:38:29.560" style="s2">beyond that to see that any attachment</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.610" end="00:38:31.690" style="s2">to mind and body to the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.530" end="00:39:59.109" style="s2">definitely a juicy question that led to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.150" end="00:40:01.579" style="s2">a juice again sir so I quite enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.109" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">no um if you can unmute yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.579" end="00:40:07.640" style="s2">your question sure um so this relates</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:09.890" style="s2">actually to a few other things which</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.640" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll maybe leave alone for the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.890" end="00:40:18.559" style="s2">being but if people so you do you expect</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:22.609" style="s2">that people would to eliminate or to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.559" end="00:40:24.380" style="s2">great extent simply drop the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.609" end="00:40:28.329" style="s2">self and instances of narratives other</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.380" end="00:40:31.160" style="s2">than a narrative that could be recreated</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.329" end="00:40:36.140" style="s2">that would actually do what you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.160" end="00:40:38.150" style="s2">want it to do or do you like given that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.140" end="00:40:40.760" style="s2">most people will not be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.150" end="00:40:43.160" style="s2">and will still have at least investments</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.760" end="00:40:44.569" style="s2">if not attachments in older narratives</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.160" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">some of which are competing not</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.569" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">compatible wouldn&#39;t it&#39;s a more more of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">a meta-narrative more of a fluid kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:55.700" style="s2">sense of self and humanity that there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:40:57.650" style="s2">the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.700" end="00:40:59.869" style="s2">humanity and of species and yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.650" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">those things aren&#39;t necessarily set in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.869" end="00:41:03.619" style="s2">stone but you&#39;re not to think of it not</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:04.910" style="s2">existing oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.619" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">don&#39;t think I did not existing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.910" end="00:41:08.540" style="s2">would be weird yeah definitely and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:10.250" style="s2">would be weird</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.540" end="00:41:12.740" style="s2">mm-hmm so I don&#39;t know what your</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.250" end="00:41:14.900" style="s2">thoughts are on my compound or not in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.740" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">question here yes so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.900" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">just to be sure I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:29.210" style="s2">question is so first of all there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.210" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">assumption that most people won&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.210" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">this kind of shift right not the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:44.089" style="s2">become a monk for five years and really</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:46.790" style="s2">see where how things are yeah few people</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.089" end="00:41:48.260" style="s2">we&#39;re assuming a few people would live</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.790" end="00:41:52.190" style="s2">the way I do</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.260" end="00:41:53.630" style="s2">for example we live the way we do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">probably not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.630" end="00:42:08.359" style="s2">too much right okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:11.660" style="s2">and given that what kind of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.359" end="00:42:17.710" style="s2">would be most helpful in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.660" end="00:42:24.980" style="s2">yeah fluid a more fluid one than say</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.710" end="00:42:28.099" style="s2">Jesus say say save you by being</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.980" end="00:42:32.630" style="s2">crucified right more fluid than that but</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.099" end="00:42:36.140" style="s2">also more fluid than then oneness and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.630" end="00:42:37.730" style="s2">and black and no self I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.140" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2">understand no cell phone yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.730" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.450" end="00:42:45.770" style="s2">yeah no self doesn&#39;t mean that there</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.680" end="00:42:48.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t itself right it also does but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.770" end="00:42:51.859" style="s2">is very clear that that all things are</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.440" end="00:42:55.010" style="s2">without self everything everything</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.859" end="00:42:58.339" style="s2">everything is without itself but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.010" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">claim it isn&#39;t a view on self it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.339" end="00:43:05.300" style="s2">difficult to approach non-self and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:08.170" style="s2">think they&#39;ve all gotten very excited</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.300" end="00:43:08.170" style="s2">about non-self</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.930" end="00:43:25.070" style="s2">I had to approach it so yeah so what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.610" end="00:43:28.760" style="s2">a better narrative that is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.070" end="00:43:31.910" style="s2">fluid right that&#39;s the question that can</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.760" end="00:43:34.310" style="s2">accommodate what people seem to get out</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.910" end="00:43:35.930" style="s2">of narratives that because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.310" end="00:43:37.400" style="s2">able to drop narratives entirely they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.930" end="00:43:41.510" style="s2">not going to be able yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.400" end="00:43:45.820" style="s2">okay this is great so this again is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">big question and I&#39;d like to give a a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.820" end="00:43:52.330" style="s2">very long answer but I&#39;m not I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:56.090" style="s2">to make that answer a little bit shorter</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.330" end="00:44:01.600" style="s2">and that means that I&#39;ll give two</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.090" end="00:44:01.600" style="s2">answers so I give two short answers so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:10.280" style="s2">so first of all in my experience so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.350" end="00:44:12.500" style="s2">first thing I want to do in the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.280" end="00:44:14.300" style="s2">answer is is just work with the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.500" end="00:44:21.260" style="s2">basic assumption that people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.300" end="00:44:30.170" style="s2">going to change how we live and I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.260" end="00:44:34.700" style="s2">to identify that as a narrative and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.170" end="00:44:37.400" style="s2">a very powerful narrative and so yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.700" end="00:44:40.310" style="s2">because that narrative is so powerful it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.400" end="00:44:47.630" style="s2">may be true but that&#39;s why it may be</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.310" end="00:44:50.320" style="s2">true people come here and and live here</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.630" end="00:44:53.510" style="s2">for years and continue it amazes me</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.320" end="00:44:56.750" style="s2">continue to refer to the ordinary world</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.510" end="00:44:58.730" style="s2">as the real world it astonishes me</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.750" end="00:45:03.260" style="s2">because the world that most liebe live</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:08.060" style="s2">in is the most artificial and fragile</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.260" end="00:45:10.610" style="s2">thing in the universe I mean the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.060" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">that you would think the characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.610" end="00:45:15.950" style="s2">of that which is quote real are least</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:19.130" style="s2">applicable to this thing we call modern</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.950" end="00:45:20.540" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s extremely complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.130" end="00:45:21.329" style="s2">it&#39;s fragile</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.540" end="00:45:25.979" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.329" end="00:45:29.749" style="s2">it&#39;s fabricated it&#39;s imaginary it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.979" end="00:45:32.009" style="s2">based on layers of imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.749" end="00:45:34.229" style="s2">everyone involved in it has to believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.009" end="00:45:36.450" style="s2">in all of that together just to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.229" end="00:45:39.450" style="s2">running and beyond that it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.450" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">to work so to go out the real world is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.450" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">amazing and yet people keep doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.420" end="00:45:47.489" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to break free of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:53.940" style="s2">that well really you have to live that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.489" end="00:45:56.489" style="s2">way but but that is is partially because</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.940" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">yes because we have a diction essential</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.489" end="00:46:03.539" style="s2">pleasure to existence and to to end to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:06.509" style="s2">the desire to survive and also the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.539" end="00:46:12.089" style="s2">desire to do be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.509" end="00:46:14.749" style="s2">we we have those addictions but but</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.089" end="00:46:18.809" style="s2">nonetheless if you go back in history</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.749" end="00:46:21.140" style="s2">just a little just a hundred years there</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.809" end="00:46:24.809" style="s2">were many more options in the world than</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.140" end="00:46:27.420" style="s2">neoliberalism just a hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.809" end="00:46:29.369" style="s2">that&#39;s brief you can go back less than</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.420" end="00:46:31.589" style="s2">that if you want but there were real</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.369" end="00:46:33.630" style="s2">functional terms if you go back ten</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.589" end="00:46:36.479" style="s2">thousand years then there was an</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.630" end="00:46:38.940" style="s2">enormous an astonishing variety of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.479" end="00:46:43.109" style="s2">culture of various forms of economy</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.940" end="00:46:45.029" style="s2">around the world and I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.109" end="00:46:48.449" style="s2">modern times we&#39;ve just forgotten that</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.029" end="00:46:52.680" style="s2">there are options and and this one has</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.449" end="00:46:54.809" style="s2">has made us believe that it&#39;s real but</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.680" end="00:47:01.160" style="s2">actually there are other options and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.809" end="00:47:05.099" style="s2">this here is one of them and ended well</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.160" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">yes I shouldn&#39;t say that I think I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.099" end="00:47:18.809" style="s2">diplomatic about this I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2">better if your people live if you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.809" end="00:47:22.709" style="s2">happier because there are the problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.150" end="00:47:24.239" style="s2">of the world we have huge problems in</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.709" end="00:47:25.739" style="s2">this way of life solve them people</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.239" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">aren&#39;t lonely or depressed or anxious</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.739" end="00:47:29.459" style="s2">and beyond that we&#39;re not contributing</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:31.589" style="s2">everyone could live at this level we</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.459" end="00:47:35.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the problems of football</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.589" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">and so-so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.000" end="00:47:42.590" style="s2">oh so it&#39;s it&#39;s a real viable option and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:44.570" style="s2">I and one of the main thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.590" end="00:47:46.190" style="s2">simply tell the story that there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.570" end="00:47:47.510" style="s2">other options I&#39;m not saying everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.190" end="00:47:48.680" style="s2">should live this way or that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.510" end="00:47:51.140" style="s2">should be Buddhists or something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.680" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">that not at all I&#39;m saying that there</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.140" end="00:47:56.180" style="s2">have been in there have been communities</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:58.970" style="s2">based around adjusting your entire life</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.180" end="00:48:01.730" style="s2">so that you can hold each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.970" end="00:48:03.230" style="s2">accountable to spiritual truth there</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.730" end="00:48:07.160" style="s2">have been those are the communities for</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.230" end="00:48:11.900" style="s2">all of human history and and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.160" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">option it&#39;s a real option for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.900" end="00:48:17.830" style="s2">and unfortunately Buddhism now now kick</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">Buddhism around for a while okay Peter</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.830" end="00:48:25.160" style="s2">what did you say but what is the verb to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:30.370" style="s2">use tres huh trash talk let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.160" end="00:48:30.370" style="s2">talk through to them that&#39;s Sophie</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.870" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">Buddhism is very good at being adaptable</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:42.680" style="s2">I think it&#39;s one of its most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:45.400" style="s2">qualities but one of the weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.680" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">that is that it it has a way of just</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.400" end="00:48:50.600" style="s2">being weak of just falling into</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:52.850" style="s2">meaninglessness and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.600" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">that is done in coming to the modern</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.850" end="00:49:00.200" style="s2">world is it says good news you can get</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:03.620" style="s2">enlightened cheaper and quicker and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.200" end="00:49:07.070" style="s2">easier than ever before all those old</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.620" end="00:49:11.120" style="s2">stupid Asian people didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.070" end="00:49:13.160" style="s2">they were doing they were you know stuck</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.120" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">in their ways and they weren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.160" end="00:49:20.690" style="s2">white so they obviously didn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:22.460" style="s2">time about so we good news can do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.690" end="00:49:24.290" style="s2">better and we&#39;re going to do it better</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.460" end="00:49:28.610" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to give you a little you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.290" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">know device or pill or new technique so</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.610" end="00:49:33.470" style="s2">that it&#39;s quicker and easier because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:38.860" style="s2">can do it better</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.470" end="00:49:41.840" style="s2">and that has meant that Buddhism says</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.860" end="00:49:43.250" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to give up you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.840" end="00:49:43.730" style="s2">change your life in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.250" end="00:49:45.140" style="s2">enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.730" end="00:49:46.630" style="s2">on the contrary getting lightened</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.140" end="00:49:48.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change how you live your</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.630" end="00:49:50.740" style="s2">you can just be happier and healthier</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.850" end="00:49:53.590" style="s2">and all that without changing how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.740" end="00:49:56.140" style="s2">live but it but because of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.590" end="00:49:58.870" style="s2">adaptability you lose a soul of it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.140" end="00:50:03.810" style="s2">the soul of it is realizing that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.870" end="00:50:08.110" style="s2">goal of life is to give up your life</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.810" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the point of life that is if that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.110" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">enlightenment doesn&#39;t come and you still</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:19.540" style="s2">have a life you lose that you give it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.650" style="s2">away you&#39;re gonna lose it anyway but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.540" end="00:50:24.130" style="s2">difference is when you&#39;re enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.650" end="00:50:26.350" style="s2">you could give it away that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.130" end="00:50:28.900" style="s2">debt the point is it good news I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.350" end="00:50:32.320" style="s2">line so I can keep it you 18 is</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.900" end="00:50:34.630" style="s2">suffering having my life that I protect</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.320" end="00:50:38.020" style="s2">and maintain and delude myself about</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.630" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not happiness you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.020" end="00:50:42.220" style="s2">backward it turned everything upside</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:45.610" style="s2">down so - so to retell the story so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.220" end="00:50:47.260" style="s2">we want to give away our like you want</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.610" end="00:50:52.410" style="s2">to change how we live that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.260" end="00:50:54.660" style="s2">extremely important first step okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.410" end="00:50:56.970" style="s2">so that&#39;s that and nonetheless I agree</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.660" end="00:50:59.370" style="s2">it&#39;s in all likelihood it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.970" end="00:51:04.410" style="s2">happen but I have to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.370" end="00:51:06.180" style="s2">statement anyway today okay yep okay yep</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.410" end="00:51:09.020" style="s2">I continue on to actually answering a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.180" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">question sure okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.020" end="00:51:13.110" style="s2">what kind of a story would work well</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.910" style="s2">Buddhism if we&#39;re gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.110" end="00:51:17.190" style="s2">Buddhism Buddhism has worked on this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.910" end="00:51:19.140" style="s2">there in Buddhism there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.190" end="00:51:20.850" style="s2">called right view have you heard of they</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.140" end="00:51:24.390" style="s2">fold path that all by any chance maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.850" end="00:51:32.430" style="s2">not yeah yes okay so I need fold path is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.390" end="00:51:34.760" style="s2">Buddhism and the beginning and end of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.430" end="00:51:34.760" style="s2">is right</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.270" end="00:51:40.950" style="s2">do you don&#39;t even want to say right view</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.380" end="00:51:51.750" style="s2">should I explain that Peter I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.950" end="00:51:56.300" style="s2">hear it okay so right view means okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.750" end="00:52:00.450" style="s2">I&#39;m back back up a little bit religions</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.300" end="00:52:01.620" style="s2">such as Christianity such as if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.450" end="00:52:08.250" style="s2">don&#39;t mind my calling and religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.620" end="00:52:12.250" style="s2">stoicism such as humanism such as</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.250" end="00:52:14.600" style="s2">materialism which runs a lot of science</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.250" end="00:52:21.330" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.600" end="00:52:24.900" style="s2">they have two things that depend on each</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.330" end="00:52:26.730" style="s2">other and feed into each other in</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.900" end="00:52:31.340" style="s2">Buddhism we have a term called Sunnis</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.730" end="00:52:35.600" style="s2">Cara but very very interesting term and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.340" end="00:52:41.220" style="s2">it&#39;s in reference to the way it is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.600" end="00:52:44.940" style="s2">see how it is that things that have no</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.220" end="00:52:50.040" style="s2">self existence can create each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.940" end="00:52:52.170" style="s2">thereby creating themselves thereby</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.040" end="00:52:53.310" style="s2">giving the sense that they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.170" end="00:52:57.090" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.310" end="00:53:01.500" style="s2">and there are two things in a you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.090" end="00:53:04.410" style="s2">in a way of in a story that that depend</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.500" end="00:53:07.830" style="s2">on each other but have to also reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.410" end="00:53:10.200" style="s2">each other in order for that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.830" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">to be maintained given the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.200" end="00:53:19.050" style="s2">of this little mind so one is what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:23.580" style="s2">would call it is and the other one might</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.050" end="00:53:26.970" style="s2">call the alt it isn&#39;t the alt and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.580" end="00:53:30.540" style="s2">there is means how do you think things</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.970" end="00:53:32.490" style="s2">really are what&#39;s your take on how</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.540" end="00:53:36.210" style="s2">things are how do you look at things and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.490" end="00:53:39.600" style="s2">what do you then do you then see okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.210" end="00:53:43.650" style="s2">this is totally clear I&#39;m asking you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.600" end="00:53:46.140" style="s2">know yeah yes clear it&#39;s clear enough to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.650" end="00:53:48.540" style="s2">for me to follow great</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.140" end="00:53:51.330" style="s2">then there&#39;s be ought then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.540" end="00:53:54.060" style="s2">prescription so the description the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.330" end="00:53:54.780" style="s2">priests group now given that that how</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.060" end="00:53:57.480" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.780" end="00:54:01.470" style="s2">you should behave in these ways you this</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.480" end="00:54:04.410" style="s2">is what you should do about it okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.470" end="00:54:06.450" style="s2">in terms of Buddhism the first two part</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.410" end="00:54:10.890" style="s2">of the Eightfold Path are the is and he</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.450" end="00:54:13.940" style="s2">ought so there&#39;s right the right way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.890" end="00:54:16.470" style="s2">see things this is how things are and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.940" end="00:54:19.560" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what we call right view</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.470" end="00:54:21.240" style="s2">then there&#39;s some Noxon culpa which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.560" end="00:54:24.330" style="s2">hard to translate but i think a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.240" end="00:54:27.050" style="s2">translation is actually right off right</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.330" end="00:54:29.220" style="s2">intention or right it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.050" end="00:54:32.910" style="s2">you know this this thing that we call</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.220" end="00:54:37.170" style="s2">the American dream you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.910" end="00:54:38.550" style="s2">when I say the American Dream not that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.170" end="00:54:42.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to know what what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.550" end="00:54:44.190" style="s2">American Dream means in that phrase yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.300" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what the word Sun Kulpa</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.190" end="00:54:54.000" style="s2">means so it&#39;s the right idea of how a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:59.340" style="s2">good life could be made that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.000" end="00:55:02.270" style="s2">yeah yeah so so in Buddhism you have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.340" end="00:55:09.540" style="s2">have right view and then you have right</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.270" end="00:55:11.310" style="s2">sankalpa right ought you then go through</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.540" end="00:55:13.809" style="s2">the whole path until you come to right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.310" end="00:55:17.979" style="s2">view again the right view that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.809" end="00:55:24.189" style="s2">start with is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.979" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">consequences to your actions what you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.189" end="00:55:32.199" style="s2">matters it makes a difference you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:33.759" style="s2">stop it from making a difference if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.199" end="00:55:35.049" style="s2">do something with the intention to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.759" end="00:55:36.939" style="s2">a difference it will make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.049" end="00:55:38.170" style="s2">if you do something with the intention</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.939" end="00:55:39.609" style="s2">of not making a difference it will make</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.170" end="00:55:41.709" style="s2">a difference it will make</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.609" end="00:55:44.969" style="s2">perhaps a different difference but it</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.709" end="00:55:50.219" style="s2">will still have an impact so what you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.969" end="00:55:55.150" style="s2">matters beyond that you can&#39;t escape it</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.219" end="00:55:56.439" style="s2">you you may die soon but you still have</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.150" end="00:56:00.309" style="s2">to face the consequences of your actions</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.439" end="00:56:03.099" style="s2">and so rebirth is part of it beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.309" end="00:56:05.549" style="s2">you can understand how it works you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.099" end="00:56:07.809" style="s2">deeply understand how this works so</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.549" end="00:56:10.059" style="s2">enlightenment is a part of it beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.809" end="00:56:12.729" style="s2">that you can teach others how about</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.059" end="00:56:15.339" style="s2">perks and so the way is part of it the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.729" end="00:56:17.439" style="s2">path is part of it so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.339" end="00:56:21.189" style="s2">together make up what we call mundane</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.439" end="00:56:26.439" style="s2">right view and a lot of world traditions</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.189" end="00:56:29.559" style="s2">hold mundane right view this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.439" end="00:56:33.299" style="s2">extremely important what you do matters</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.559" end="00:56:36.699" style="s2">and if and again as I was saying before</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.299" end="00:56:39.160" style="s2">when we look at this meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.699" end="00:56:42.249" style="s2">I&#39;m and I&#39;m working with two dozen</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.160" end="00:56:46.869" style="s2">people living here right now working on</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.249" end="00:56:51.039" style="s2">myself obviously as well one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.869" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">significant obstacles for us is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.039" end="00:56:57.579" style="s2">sense that what you do doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:59.709" style="s2">make any difference there&#39;s a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.579" end="00:57:01.179" style="s2">if I haven&#39;t changed billions of lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.709" end="00:57:06.209" style="s2">than I might as well not have lived at</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.179" end="00:57:07.869" style="s2">all ah but then you have people who have</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.209" end="00:57:09.549" style="s2">billions of lives and they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.869" end="00:57:11.349" style="s2">well but I even do the right thing I</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.549" end="00:57:16.059" style="s2">don&#39;t know so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.349" end="00:57:18.429" style="s2">lived either I know someone has changed</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.059" end="00:57:19.719" style="s2">billions of lives and he stopped doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.429" end="00:57:22.239" style="s2">that thing because he felt like he</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.719" end="00:57:27.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t making a difference he changed</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.239" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">his whole career so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.650" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.980" end="00:57:37.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for us to accept this</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.790" end="00:57:39.790" style="s2">quote this meaning that everything you</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.240" end="00:57:43.480" style="s2">do has an impact and you can&#39;t escape it</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.790" end="00:57:46.570" style="s2">everything you do that is done in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.480" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">selfish hateful ignorant way will cause</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.570" end="00:57:50.740" style="s2">suffering and you will experience that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:53.050" style="s2">suffer everything you do that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.740" end="00:57:56.380" style="s2">from a compassionate place a loving</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.050" end="00:57:58.300" style="s2">place a wise place will cause happiness</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.380" end="00:57:59.890" style="s2">bliss resolution of suffering and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.300" end="00:58:03.010" style="s2">will experience that happiness that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.890" end="00:58:06.040" style="s2">bliss that resolution of suffering you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.010" end="00:58:08.710" style="s2">can&#39;t avoid it this is how it is this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.040" end="00:58:12.310" style="s2">the appropriate way and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.710" end="00:58:15.730" style="s2">accurate for a person who is not let go</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.310" end="00:58:17.350" style="s2">of self to see the world you then go</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.730" end="00:58:19.300" style="s2">through the whole path to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.350" end="00:58:21.760" style="s2">point of letting go of self and directly</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.300" end="00:58:23.770" style="s2">experience non-self and with the direct</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.760" end="00:58:26.320" style="s2">experience of non-self then it isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.770" end="00:58:29.530" style="s2">much that mundane right view isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.320" end="00:58:32.170" style="s2">it&#39;s just not applicable it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.530" end="00:58:36.100" style="s2">relevant because you have a completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.170" end="00:58:38.560" style="s2">different motivation for being of taking</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.100" end="00:58:42.700" style="s2">action in the world which you could say</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.560" end="00:58:45.400" style="s2">in no intentional or USA is purely</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.700" end="00:58:49.420" style="s2">compassionate but in any case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.400" end="00:58:50.830" style="s2">unimaginable and so for those people I</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.420" end="00:58:52.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s the group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.830" end="00:58:55.000" style="s2">you&#39;re referring to the very few people</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.840" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">who may do it everyone else then to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.000" end="00:58:59.980" style="s2">the best way to look at it is that our</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:01.750" style="s2">actions make a difference and they make</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.980" end="00:59:06.550" style="s2">a difference to us and it&#39;s inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.750" end="00:59:08.670" style="s2">and everything you do everything every</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.550" end="00:59:12.520" style="s2">thought you have every word you say</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.670" end="00:59:19.270" style="s2">every action you take every breath has</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.520" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">an impact and must be accepted as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.270" end="00:59:28.390" style="s2">miraculous we must be creative as</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:32.590" style="s2">holding this miraculous power so that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.390" end="00:59:38.080" style="s2">begin to feel more and more empowered as</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.590" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">each day passes does that help or not</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.080" end="00:59:43.240" style="s2">was it all relative</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:43.780" style="s2">it is and in a way they didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.240" end="00:59:46.870" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.780" end="00:59:49.780" style="s2">thank you I don&#39;t know that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.870" end="00:59:52.030" style="s2">meta-narrative or not right it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.780" end="00:59:55.210" style="s2">seems like like the way I see it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.030" end="00:59:57.160" style="s2">a it&#39;s a condition for a meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.210" end="00:59:59.830" style="s2">that would work and would have the I</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.160" end="01:00:03.790" style="s2">guess accountability responsibility sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.830" end="01:00:06.490" style="s2">of function for it yeah and then and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.790" end="01:00:09.190" style="s2">also this law of cotton effect mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.490" end="01:00:11.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just a law that you can&#39;t avoid and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.190" end="01:00:15.190" style="s2">then what would it meta-narrative be you</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.980" end="01:00:16.360" style="s2">might based on that so I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.190" end="01:00:18.490" style="s2">narrative could I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.360" end="01:00:20.700" style="s2">meta-narrative could be like narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.490" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">that&#39;s like not not immediate like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.700" end="01:00:25.960" style="s2">history of humanity and the earth it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:28.840" style="s2">could there&#39;s many many ways you can go</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.960" end="01:00:29.770" style="s2">with it but that ties it together if</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.840" end="01:00:32.320" style="s2">different people have different</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.770" end="01:00:35.500" style="s2">narratives what can tie it together</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.320" end="01:00:37.030" style="s2">would be something like this cause and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.500" end="01:00:38.730" style="s2">effect would be part of what ties it</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.030" end="01:00:41.020" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.730" end="01:00:42.750" style="s2">Wow so you&#39;re saying that it could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.020" end="01:00:46.420" style="s2">you could look at it from a scientific</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.750" end="01:00:48.280" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s geological time you</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.420" end="01:00:51.820" style="s2">could look at it from an economic</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.280" end="01:00:54.310" style="s2">perspective you could look at it from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.820" end="01:00:56.500" style="s2">personal perspective is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.310" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">saying yeah you could look at a personal</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.500" end="01:01:00.340" style="s2">perspective and just interaction between</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.250" style="s2">different groups of people like people</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.340" end="01:01:05.800" style="s2">who continue to hold identities of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.250" end="01:01:08.230" style="s2">groups or of humanity or whatever how</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.800" end="01:01:09.930" style="s2">that all relates to each other how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.230" end="01:01:17.290" style="s2">live together</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.930" end="01:01:20.940" style="s2">yeah really interesting yeah I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.290" end="01:01:24.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very very lucky to live in</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.940" end="01:01:26.830" style="s2">places with very different narratives my</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.730" end="01:01:29.400" style="s2">life I trained at a Zen master in Japan</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.830" end="01:01:32.350" style="s2">under the embed car monastery in India</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.400" end="01:01:36.190" style="s2">at another Buddhist master in China I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.350" end="01:01:42.630" style="s2">also have done Native American</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.190" end="01:01:45.660" style="s2">reservations here on this continent and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.630" end="01:01:48.850" style="s2">along with you know growing up in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.660" end="01:01:51.550" style="s2">in this culture this you know I went to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.850" end="01:01:56.620" style="s2">public school and learned about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.550" end="01:01:57.080" style="s2">stuff so I feel very fortunate and grew</p>

<p begin="01:01:57.080" end="01:02:02.710" style="s2">grew up in a Christian tradition so so I</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.470" end="01:02:09.560" style="s2">feel really fortunate to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.710" end="01:02:11.390" style="s2">experienced all that and uh and so it</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.560" end="01:02:15.950" style="s2">makes your question very significant for</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.390" end="01:02:17.120" style="s2">me because then one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.950" end="01:02:19.040" style="s2">needed to work on from what becoming</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.120" end="01:02:21.890" style="s2">capable of entering each of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.040" end="01:02:25.550" style="s2">narratives fully to the point that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.890" end="01:02:29.270" style="s2">benefited me when I would go to one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.550" end="01:02:32.600" style="s2">the measures that I would use for myself</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.270" end="01:02:33.860" style="s2">is that if I enter a certain group or</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.600" end="01:02:38.300" style="s2">culture or tradition</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.860" end="01:02:43.250" style="s2">then I&#39;ll commit to that at least until</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.300" end="01:02:47.530" style="s2">the day when I when it has changed who I</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.250" end="01:02:50.270" style="s2">am and I&#39;m grateful for its impact on me</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.530" end="01:02:52.100" style="s2">and then I&#39;m feel like okay now I&#39;m free</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.270" end="01:02:55.880" style="s2">to decide how long I&#39;ll stay with this</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.100" end="01:02:58.250" style="s2">but until I have until I will always</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.880" end="01:03:07.580" style="s2">speak with gratitude about its existence</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.250" end="01:03:08.870" style="s2">I am NOT allowed to leave and what that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.580" end="01:03:11.750" style="s2">means is that you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.870" end="01:03:14.450" style="s2">really go for it you cannot stay outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.750" end="01:03:18.340" style="s2">and have a change or you or have a day</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.450" end="01:03:22.040" style="s2">in your life you have to surrender and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.340" end="01:03:23.690" style="s2">and and so then you have so I think a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.040" end="01:03:26.810" style="s2">meta-narrative is kind of like well what</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.690" end="01:03:29.030" style="s2">is the what is that all about how what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.810" end="01:03:35.960" style="s2">the story about the surrender to all</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.030" end="01:03:37.730" style="s2">these narratives and so yeah a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.960" end="01:03:40.220" style="s2">important part of that is that what we</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.730" end="01:03:47.240" style="s2">do matters that there is that there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.220" end="01:03:53.930" style="s2">consequences but I think also it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.240" end="01:03:58.700" style="s2">a faith that of the same is the first</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.930" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">question of faith that there is a truth</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.700" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">and a beauty here that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.120" end="01:04:17.910" style="s2">beyond my ability to judge and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.550" end="01:04:25.080" style="s2">and a faith in that with each person and</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.910" end="01:04:26.820" style="s2">each culture each tradition each life we</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.080" end="01:04:29.940" style="s2">have the faith that there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.820" end="01:04:32.010" style="s2">this it&#39;s true and beautiful and I am</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.940" end="01:04:35.010" style="s2">grateful that I have been given the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.010" end="01:04:45.390" style="s2">chance to perceive it may may I perceive</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.010" end="01:04:47.190" style="s2">it yeah it&#39;s really hard here because we</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.390" end="01:04:49.020" style="s2">have so much shame around this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.190" end="01:04:51.900" style="s2">thing shame is so this is a big deal for</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.020" end="01:04:55.530" style="s2">us here remember there was I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.900" end="01:04:56.790" style="s2">with a monk in India about this and he</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.530" end="01:04:58.320" style="s2">was just he was telling me that one of</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.790" end="01:05:03.270" style="s2">the most important solutions to any</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.320" end="01:05:09.990" style="s2">problem is the ability to say I am NOT</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.270" end="01:05:21.300" style="s2">mature enough to to know how to deal</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.990" end="01:05:24.540" style="s2">with this any difficulty I have will</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.300" end="01:05:27.180" style="s2">help me at least to be humble so that I</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.540" end="01:05:29.630" style="s2">can see that I&#39;m not mature enough and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.180" end="01:05:32.070" style="s2">he said once you are humble enough and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.630" end="01:05:35.340" style="s2">have accepted that enough then it will</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.070" end="01:05:37.860" style="s2">come very naturally to you and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.340" end="01:05:41.130" style="s2">tried to tell people it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.860" end="01:05:42.450" style="s2">though Allah we have such shame that it</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.130" end="01:05:46.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t turn into humility turns into</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.450" end="01:05:48.390" style="s2">shame I think that that&#39;s a that this</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.230" end="01:05:51.030" style="s2">sense of it&#39;s very important that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.390" end="01:05:54.170" style="s2">also apply that to ourselves that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.030" end="01:05:56.130" style="s2">ourselves in fact that I myself am just</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.170" end="01:06:00.090" style="s2">one of these people one of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.130" end="01:06:02.550" style="s2">traditions that needs to be huge</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.090" end="01:06:04.200" style="s2">that I should approach with a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.550" end="01:06:07.470" style="s2">humility and hope that I&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.200" end="01:06:11.850" style="s2">the astonishing miraculous beauty in</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.470" end="01:06:13.800" style="s2">this in this Sun SCARA that is myself</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.850" end="01:06:19.750" style="s2">that is this mind in this body in this</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.990" end="01:06:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s 8:10 that&#39;s a great assumption is</p>

<p begin="01:07:26.050" end="01:07:35.170" style="s2">mine&#39;s a very simple question if I want</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.800" end="01:07:39.270" style="s2">to wake up tomorrow and decide to climb</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.170" end="01:07:44.260" style="s2">Mount Everest without any prior training</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.270" end="01:07:49.710" style="s2">right so what should I do if I want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.260" end="01:08:01.720" style="s2">join the monastic Academy Oh interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.710" end="01:08:06.010" style="s2">if you want to join this place it seems</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.720" end="01:08:08.430" style="s2">it isn&#39;t as big of a task as Mount</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.010" end="01:08:08.430" style="s2">Everest</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.790" end="01:08:17.509" style="s2">because we have a lot we here we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.980" end="01:08:24.380" style="s2">two groups of people we have the people</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.509" end="01:08:27.140" style="s2">who come to as we put a heal and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.380" end="01:08:32.810" style="s2">people who come who come in order to as</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.140" end="01:08:37.160" style="s2">we put it die and you enter the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.810" end="01:08:40.069" style="s2">healing group first and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.160" end="01:08:43.130" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you see that when you</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.069" end="01:08:44.420" style="s2">have both healed in in the very</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.130" end="01:08:48.819" style="s2">important ways that we should</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.420" end="01:08:51.049" style="s2">emotionally socially psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.819" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">when we&#39;ve worked through the some of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.049" end="01:08:54.680" style="s2">that then we can face that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:59.330" style="s2">important way in which we will never</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.680" end="01:09:02.330" style="s2">heal and so in that way we we die and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.330" end="01:09:06.819" style="s2">see that good knows we never needed to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.330" end="01:09:06.819" style="s2">heal because we were never broken</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.180" end="01:09:14.009" style="s2">from there we go back into the healing</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.370" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">group and from that</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.009" end="01:09:21.219" style="s2">perspective we again work on our</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:24.009" style="s2">personal lives work on cultivating for</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.219" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">you and dealing with our pasts from us</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.009" end="01:09:30.819" style="s2">so here because you should do that if</p>

<p begin="01:09:30.819" end="01:09:35.769" style="s2">problems for spiritual teachers because</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.400" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">they don&#39;t do that that side of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.769" end="01:09:44.739" style="s2">train station they use precise as ways</p>

<p begin="01:09:44.739" end="01:09:50.380" style="s2">have some kind of insight but you can</p>

<p begin="01:13:54.360" end="01:13:58.590" style="s2">that that what&#39;s happened recently there</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:14:01.110" style="s2">have been many negatives about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.590" end="01:14:04.740" style="s2">been happening but we&#39;re seeing some of</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.110" end="01:14:08.040" style="s2">the positives as well does that make</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.740" end="01:14:11.550" style="s2">sense yeah and I expected that thank you</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.810" end="01:14:36.270" style="s2">to frame this question in the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.140" end="01:14:40.590" style="s2">accurate way maybe Jared or someone can</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.270" end="01:14:45.270" style="s2">jump in but I&#39;ve been wondering how</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.590" end="01:14:49.170" style="s2">maple relates to Buddhist paths Sutra</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.270" end="01:14:53.420" style="s2">Tantra is a bit perhaps you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.170" end="01:14:58.770" style="s2">developing an new jana of some kind a</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.420" end="01:15:02.330" style="s2">new jana yeah well one of our supporters</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.770" end="01:15:02.330" style="s2">lines is to create the Hana</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.419" end="01:15:14.929" style="s2">haha Ghana is the fun pass the laughing</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.659" end="01:15:15.530" style="s2">vehicle the haha Jana so I don&#39;t I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.929" end="01:15:19.939" style="s2">good at that</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.530" end="01:15:23.300" style="s2">that&#39;s not my my skill set so I tend to</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.939" end="01:15:26.419" style="s2">say that we I don&#39;t think we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.300" end="01:15:28.039" style="s2">a new Jana actually I think that there</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.419" end="01:15:30.619" style="s2">was in a way a fourth turning of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.039" end="01:15:32.630" style="s2">wheel that started in Asia in particular</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.619" end="01:15:35.689" style="s2">in India which is the sense of quote</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.630" end="01:15:39.530" style="s2">socially engaged Buddhism and you might</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.689" end="01:15:43.489" style="s2">call that a new Jana they call it the</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.530" end="01:15:47.300" style="s2">Noah Jana this there&#39;s is just Sanskrit</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.489" end="01:15:50.030" style="s2">for new Jana her new vehicle but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.300" end="01:15:51.979" style="s2">I don&#39;t really think that that is I</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.030" end="01:15:53.389" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that different from</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.979" end="01:15:58.639" style="s2">a lot of what we&#39;ve seen in the Mahayana</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.389" end="01:15:59.989" style="s2">or you might even say bojay Jana Peters</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.639" end="01:16:03.649" style="s2">did I clarify what all these other</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.989" end="01:16:05.840" style="s2">Sanskrit means or not I have no idea so</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.649" end="01:16:09.110" style="s2">I know I said so to you Andy are you</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.840" end="01:16:10.550" style="s2">curious or should I just let it go yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.110" end="01:16:14.959" style="s2">I think there&#39;s curiosity in the room</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.550" end="01:16:16.849" style="s2">okay great good so a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.959" end="01:16:21.530" style="s2">when we talked about Buddhism we talked</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.849" end="01:16:24.880" style="s2">about well sometimes we talk about one</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.530" end="01:16:27.019" style="s2">vehicle sometimes you talk about two</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:28.130" style="s2">sometimes you talk about three and as</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.019" end="01:16:31.340" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard sometimes you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.130" end="01:16:35.989" style="s2">nowadays recent decades sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.340" end="01:16:40.369" style="s2">talk about four and the one vehicle is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.989" end="01:16:42.679" style="s2">is simply that everyone is moving toward</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.369" end="01:16:47.840" style="s2">enlightenment and so all of put ism is</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.679" end="01:16:52.969" style="s2">the same thing the two vehicles are a</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.840" end="01:16:55.130" style="s2">distinction between those who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.969" end="01:16:57.079" style="s2">striving for their own enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.130" end="01:16:59.570" style="s2">those who are striving for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.079" end="01:17:04.999" style="s2">enlightenment of all beings or at least</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.570" end="01:17:11.630" style="s2">all Society now it&#39;s important to know</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.999" end="01:17:13.729" style="s2">that that for most of its history the</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.630" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">two these two vehicles haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.729" end="01:17:20.329" style="s2">interacted that much but in in early</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">times when when the Mahayana those who</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.329" end="01:17:26.090" style="s2">are interested in helping many people</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:27.739" style="s2">many beings all beings and those who are</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.090" end="01:17:31.149" style="s2">interested in their own personal path</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.739" end="01:17:34.039" style="s2">when when they were starting to develop</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.149" end="01:17:35.389" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t antagonism between them</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.039" end="01:17:37.130" style="s2">because there was a lot of communication</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.389" end="01:17:39.800" style="s2">between them and they were both taken to</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.130" end="01:17:42.110" style="s2">be legitimate approaches nowadays</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.800" end="01:17:43.419" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some antagonism but I</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.110" end="01:17:51.229" style="s2">actually would suggest that there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.419" end="01:17:53.599" style="s2">antagonism that each one is just saying</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.229" end="01:17:55.429" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to practice this then</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.599" end="01:17:57.619" style="s2">you have to practice this and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.429" end="01:18:00.649" style="s2">very important general principle and</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.619" end="01:18:03.169" style="s2">spirituality as far as I can tell it</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.649" end="01:18:06.649" style="s2">isn&#39;t it usually a good idea to take up</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.169" end="01:18:09.169" style="s2">a certain path but not practice it the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.649" end="01:18:10.939" style="s2">way it was taught because you&#39;re wanting</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.169" end="01:18:14.059" style="s2">to practice another pass at the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.939" end="01:18:17.030" style="s2">time and so I think I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.059" end="01:18:19.189" style="s2">quote antagonism can be explained by</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.030" end="01:18:20.840" style="s2">them not so much saying those people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.189" end="01:18:24.199" style="s2">bad but if you&#39;re going to practice this</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.840" end="01:18:26.510" style="s2">then practicing that is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.199" end="01:18:31.309" style="s2">going to do it this way you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.510" end="01:18:32.959" style="s2">it this way or else it won&#39;t work so if</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.309" end="01:18:35.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the true of those well then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.959" end="01:18:39.550" style="s2">really true of what came later which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.300" end="01:18:42.789" style="s2">the Vajrayana and the budgie on up uses</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.550" end="01:18:44.090" style="s2">everything as a vehicle for</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.789" end="01:18:48.590" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.090" end="01:18:50.539" style="s2">absolutely everything and it is for that</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.590" end="01:18:53.809" style="s2">reason extremely effective and also</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.539" end="01:18:58.969" style="s2">extremely dangerous because you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.809" end="01:19:02.689" style="s2">parts of life that are in which were</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.969" end="01:19:04.729" style="s2">very delusional and selfish and so the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.689" end="01:19:06.590" style="s2">Reggiana often does a lot of damage but</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.729" end="01:19:10.989" style="s2">it also does a lot of good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.590" end="01:19:10.989" style="s2">extremely effective and quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.139" end="01:19:17.869" style="s2">so kind of like a car you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.099" end="01:19:19.669" style="s2">walk somewhere you probably you might</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.869" end="01:19:23.209" style="s2">trip but that won&#39;t kill you but in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.669" end="01:19:24.059" style="s2">car if you make a mistake in my typical</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.209" end="01:19:27.210" style="s2">you or someone else</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.059" end="01:19:29.219" style="s2">so so these are the very these are this</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.210" end="01:19:34.289" style="s2">is a very quick way of talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.219" end="01:19:36.150" style="s2">the vehicles what was your name Sarah do</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.289" end="01:19:37.619" style="s2">you think that was a good did I</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.150" end="01:19:42.210" style="s2">basically discuss what you were</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.619" end="01:19:44.909" style="s2">referring to I guess I have a more I can</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.210" end="01:19:47.010" style="s2">provide a more useful context for the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.909" end="01:19:49.020" style="s2">question which is oh no I didn&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.010" end="01:19:51.539" style="s2">was answering your question generally I</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.020" end="01:19:53.420" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in that I was just giving a</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.539" end="01:19:56.429" style="s2">background of the question to the group</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.420" end="01:19:58.739" style="s2">okay you feel free to ask it again but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.429" end="01:20:01.289" style="s2">I didn&#39;t think I had just standard oh</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.739" end="01:20:03.000" style="s2">okay I do think the context might help</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.289" end="01:20:05.670" style="s2">people connect with it which is having</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.000" end="01:20:09.270" style="s2">seen in some conversations over the past</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.670" end="01:20:12.329" style="s2">year with Daniel sourcing okay and</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.270" end="01:20:15.179" style="s2">written on Twitter I think unique was in</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.329" end="01:20:18.929" style="s2">one trade also they were like people are</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.179" end="01:20:22.730" style="s2">you know doing this deep emotional work</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.929" end="01:20:26.489" style="s2">and kind of uncertain whether that was</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.730" end="01:20:29.179" style="s2">coming in the kind of sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.489" end="01:20:31.469" style="s2">associated more with Tantra in Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.179" end="01:20:34.889" style="s2">traditions and wondering how that fit in</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.469" end="01:20:39.630" style="s2">with the more renunciate part of some of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.889" end="01:20:43.050" style="s2">the practices it made for yeah so so I</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.630" end="01:20:46.670" style="s2">think the the most important thing to</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.050" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">say as a very brief answer is that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.670" end="01:20:57.270" style="s2">are extremely eclectic in our approach</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:57.989" style="s2">and we are trying to be true to what I</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.270" end="01:20:59.039" style="s2">already said</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.989" end="01:21:00.449" style="s2">which is that if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.039" end="01:21:04.889" style="s2">practice something you should practice</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.449" end="01:21:07.619" style="s2">it according to its tradition and also</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.889" end="01:21:10.199" style="s2">being aware because we&#39;re we&#39;re based</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.619" end="01:21:13.170" style="s2">primarily on chins and young a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.199" end="01:21:14.820" style="s2">interesting teacher who was ordained in</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.170" end="01:21:18.380" style="s2">the Vajrayana tradition but has</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.820" end="01:21:22.920" style="s2">ultimately become more or less a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.380" end="01:21:26.489" style="s2">Kasana a more sort of a terawatt and</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.920" end="01:21:29.159" style="s2">style teacher having trained for a long</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.489" end="01:21:31.929" style="s2">time in zen as well which is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.159" end="01:21:34.940" style="s2">mahayana so</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.929" end="01:21:37.340" style="s2">so he is extremely eclectic in his</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.940" end="01:21:40.550" style="s2">approach and he he thinks it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.340" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">important and useful to give people the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.550" end="01:21:45.260" style="s2">chance to practice different approaches</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:46.610" style="s2">as we say while you&#39;re pricing that</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.260" end="01:21:49.639" style="s2">approach as you practice that approach</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.610" end="01:21:52.040" style="s2">correctly but you don&#39;t have to stay</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.639" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">with it forever and for some people they</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.040" end="01:21:55.489" style="s2">stay with something for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.360" end="01:21:58.790" style="s2">other people not such a long time</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.489" end="01:22:00.710" style="s2">and so in that way yes we do a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.790" end="01:22:03.829" style="s2">emotional processing but there is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.710" end="01:22:07.849" style="s2">option of a more renunciate approach as</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.829" end="01:22:09.800" style="s2">well there&#39;s the possibility of striving</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.849" end="01:22:13.510" style="s2">for one&#39;s own liberation and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.800" end="01:22:17.810" style="s2">possibility of striving for all beings</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.510" end="01:22:23.949" style="s2">we attempt we do our best to offer those</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.810" end="01:22:27.170" style="s2">various paths to the group here and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.949" end="01:22:30.500" style="s2">sort of discover as we do it and as we</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.170" end="01:22:33.889" style="s2">use more modern methods for that such as</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.500" end="01:22:37.460" style="s2">say circling and other or emotional</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.889" end="01:22:41.949" style="s2">processing how it is that those newer</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.460" end="01:22:45.219" style="s2">technologies fit into don&#39;t fit into</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.949" end="01:22:48.679" style="s2">create something new maybe detract from</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.219" end="01:22:51.320" style="s2">the the more traditional methods so one</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.679" end="01:22:59.780" style="s2">of the main things that we struggle with</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.320" end="01:23:02.329" style="s2">is in discovering how to bring all these</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.780" end="01:23:05.420" style="s2">various approaches into one community</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.329" end="01:23:07.880" style="s2">even though they&#39;re not brought usually</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.420" end="01:23:09.980" style="s2">brought together into each member of</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.880" end="01:23:14.630" style="s2">that community does that answer your</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.980" end="01:23:17.210" style="s2">question I think so I mean it does sound</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.630" end="01:23:20.810" style="s2">like a challenge to have all those under</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.210" end="01:23:23.800" style="s2">one roof at the same time with multiple</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.810" end="01:23:31.730" style="s2">paths yeah very very challenging</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.800" end="01:23:34.040" style="s2">extremely challenging so we&#39;re almost at</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.730" end="01:23:36.469" style="s2">the 90 minute mark shall we end it here</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.040" end="01:23:38.780" style="s2">oh sorry or feel the few more questions</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.469" end="01:23:40.190" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying we&#39;re gonna end</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.780" end="01:23:43.210" style="s2">it here I could answer the questions</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.190" end="01:23:43.210" style="s2">extremely fast</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.710" end="01:23:48.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t know uh you can always come back</p>
