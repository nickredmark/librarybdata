<p begin="00:00:03.280" end="00:00:06.399" style="s2">all right so yeah we were going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.799" end="00:00:07.919" style="s2">about today what was the topic it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.399" end="00:00:11.360" style="s2">like resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:14.920" style="s2">or survival versus</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">thriving survival mode to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.920" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">wholeness and my question was a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.039" end="00:00:23.680" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:26.720" style="s2">what does it mean for a native american</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.680" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">or somebody</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.720" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">very familiar with this language</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">what does it mean for you to be whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:39.920" style="s2">or to be in survival mode so starting</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">with survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:45.280" style="s2">um i think i&#39;m often in both</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:46.399" style="s2">simultaneously survival mode is needing</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.280" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">your basic</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.399" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">maslow&#39;s needs to be met food clothing</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">shelter and a lot of times in current</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">even when those needs are being met</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;re scared they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">right like i don&#39;t because i get my food</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">from a grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">i&#39;m reliant on them having food at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">grocery store and i&#39;m also reliant on me</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">having money to pay for that food at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">grocery store which is very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.479" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">than growing intending a garden</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.439" style="s2">that i know is gonna yes the garden</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">might fail</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.439" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">but the skill the time the the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">is there</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">to be able to to build it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">certain amount of survival mode that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">because i don&#39;t have those skills um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s also a certain level of survival</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">that um i tap into each day</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">based on the fact that like in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">morning i have my highest capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">mental emotional and physical</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">capacity and throughout the day it gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">diminished and so near the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">day i&#39;m on survival mode my body feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s being attacked by tigers even</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">logically i know that&#39;s not true it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">feels like the sights</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">sounds and smells are so i switch from</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">survival mode to this wholeness because</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve had to develop a deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">to be able to adapt to that cycle and be</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">able to get my needs met</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">within current game a society well not</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">being able to play game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s unique that&#39;s it i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">looking forward to this one i liked your</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">blog post about um</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">nonsense and the australian who um</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">australia was one of the words</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">on their like australian like an alien</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">australia alien and i was like was that</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">that um no no it&#39;s um no</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">it was just a friend and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">by thinking and later writing about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">topic of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">video podcast now i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">thinking about this friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">who is really just working six</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">weeks per year uh making him enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">money to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">uh to survive for the rest of the year</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">he was a little bit upset about his</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">family um</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">complaining that he&#39;s doing nothing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">that he&#39;s not working more harder to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">make more money</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">to create more security and things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">he used this term nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">and for me it is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">a question of liberty if you are able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">do something without any specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">sense just to be in in a flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">or to come into a flow um</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">by doing some artworks or</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">or cleaning or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">it gives me a kind of peace and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">and happiness and and and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">i would identify as independent as</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">something i appreciate a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">so nonsense is um something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">a signal for the right mode</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">that something is in the right mode and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">the survival mode in in my article</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">i wrote about this mode because</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">my experience of the last four months</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">is that i have every day one or two</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">desperate in finding a place because</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">even now it&#39;s not only a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">of having better food or having</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">better companionship it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">having any companionship any social life</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">having any money or anything to eat what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">to drink</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">so a lot of people are losing the job</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know where they could say</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">they realized now really what it means</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">to be in a little family not in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">plants in these big groups like hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">so um they are desperate</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">and they call and they ask they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">their checklist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">this reminds all to this survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">no they</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">they ask how many kids are in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">do you have inside jobs can i escape</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">from the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">is is it possible to be auto</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">sufficient do you produce what you eat</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">and drink</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">this is much more than it was one or two</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">or three years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">when people asked for a visit of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">joining this community</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">because they themselves are more in</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">survival mode yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">and and they feel that um everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">around them</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">is also in survival mode so it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">like a general</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">move movement in the society to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">return to this basics so</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">i get the information that in europe in</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">mode then they started</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">and um i see the same in in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">in the language in in social media when</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">people are talking in</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">and community life</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">the language changed</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;s less about dreams and less about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.280" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">opportunities and nice projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">it&#39;s much more about this</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">wondering well you were talking i had</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">thought of people the survival to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">wholeness and i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">a lot of us have experienced that before</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve had our own personal crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">like oh i can&#39;t survive on my own or i</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">need to learn how to survive on my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">that we&#39;ve come through this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">and that was part there&#39;s a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">societal piece that most people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">gone through</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">that actually it&#39;s society that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">not able to meet our survival needs and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">is not whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">and i think that that is what people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">waking up to and then it puts them into</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">survival mode right that they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">my god</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">like there won&#39;t be food in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">supermarket there won&#39;t be this there</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">like they&#39;re waking up to how</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">fragile society is and needing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">like get their individual piece figured</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">out when really we can&#39;t actually figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">it out on a societal like on an</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">individual or tiny community level</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">like even as you know even if i have all</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">the skill to grow my own food and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">sustainable community unless we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">willing to kill and die for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">unless other people are fed we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">right like the world needs to be fed for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">my belly to be full</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">and to feel safety uh from my</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:02.839" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">i see everybody even in western</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.839" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">societies growing</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">up already embedded in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">communities one community is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">the global civilization another</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">is the nation the city the village</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">the street the neighbors maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">associations the family a couple</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">so there are entities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">some of these entities they</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">painted a very nice picture of security</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">how to to manage a way of life which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">if you follow some rules you get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">benefit of the security and this money</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">and you achieve what you want and now it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">it breaks down and and people realize no</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">not in my company not in my society not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">in my village</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">not with this type of politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">where else is an entity where</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">i can get this and i think this is um</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">in a way a problem we had in germany in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">a very controversial politician who said</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">if i talk the truth they will not vote</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">if i lie they vote for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">so what i should do so the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">a lot of people even people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">looking now for community life</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">they are attracted by illusions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">even communities they produce a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">they have nice pictures on their</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">websites with</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">people dancing around candles</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">just beautiful so it&#39;s like marketing</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">for a guided tour</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">through happiness but</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">i think it will not work as it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">as it doesn&#39;t work in the big community</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">it will not work in this little</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">communities as well but people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">highly attracted by this</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">because of this component of fear</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">what they experience they um</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">they are trapped into this uh very</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">very limited cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">discovering a challenge and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">as soon as possible a solution for this</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">and and they they feel they have no time</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">they need</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">a solution now and this now</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">makes them vulnerable for any</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">kind of advertising which address</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">this fear</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">yes i feel it also i also want it now</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">like i also i&#39;ve realized in the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">week specifically</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">but also maybe the week previous to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">how much i</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">am lacking in the community social</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">physical connection and even more so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">than my needs not being met my kids</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">like a rural-ish community where my kids</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">needs are met and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">we can figure out how to get beyond</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how necessarily to meet</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">that within our current ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">and yet i know that it is a</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">of the employees so this was clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">15 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">there are other things there they are</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">very clear if if you start a project</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">uh let&#39;s think about a company</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">or any other project you you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">you feel with your heart you want to</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">some years to make it um</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">functional in a way so</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">i am surprised that the people now</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">are panicking a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">everything of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">not in detail and not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">in this massive scale what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">see now in this world but in general</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">everything of this was clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">even years before now</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">we talked about the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">a higher average of temperature because</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">you you can look back in in the history</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">of this planet</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">how life was at a time in which it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">much warmer most of the times we had no</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">ice on</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">the nautical in this planet history</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">but we know very well how it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">um in the jungle how many species</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">we we had and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">we know that the pressure of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">nature to occupy eomas</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">in a competition against humanity</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">is bigger in a on a planet</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">which has an average of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">temperature</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">so so nothing of this is really a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">surprise</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">so i said five six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">to the first visitors of our community</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">the skills you you will need in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">are you need to know what you can eat</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">and how to find it how to seed</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">how to find the seeds how to plant it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">how to harvest it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">and you need the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">and the power to protect it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">and this is an ugly truth so it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">not um surprise it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">just um um</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">maybe this tendency to stick in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">comfort zone</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something about what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">as a society</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">and a civilization that of course we all</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">used to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">tribal and living off the land and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">tied to that cycle and we&#39;ve lost a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">of that knowledge partly because our</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">survival has tied to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">right we go we trade hours for dollars</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">or whatever for dollars</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">and then trade that for our survival</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">right and the very things that used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">that are the only things required that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">were seen during the pandemic like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">farmers like you know what i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">essential workers</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">are um the least paid in society</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re like we want access to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">for cheaper and cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">well we and like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">are losing work right work is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">less and less of something that is even</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">usable on like we&#39;re coming to the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">of work</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">as a concept in in our society and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">we tie it to our survival in such an</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">intimate way that when</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">the wholeness of society comes into</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">our very survival does for real come</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">into question right this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">pretend um you know like</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">the stress of going to a party feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">like a tiger attacking me this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">actually me and mine starving to death</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">right like there&#39;s an actual real</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">outcome to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">because we&#39;ve lost our roots and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">lost our survival and we&#39;ve lost and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">on a personal level anymore like we like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">i can go and get the information for how</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">to survive in the wild in bc</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">even with that information even if i was</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">capable of physically hunting and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">gardening and doing those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">there isn&#39;t enough of that for to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">certain for</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">to sustain the population of bc which</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">means it&#39;s a scarce resource</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to fight over it to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">death like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">there&#39;s if that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount we that is true</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">here that is like right we are down to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">survival</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s also a piece that is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">the bullshit of game a of like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">going to a party isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">a tiger though right and we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">focused on like the smoke and mirrors</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">of what it means to like pretend we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">surviving right like no i need that new</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">car and the instagram post that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:47.840" style="s2">survival</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like no no no that was never</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.840" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">survival that was never real</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">but there&#39;s this underlining truth of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">like right but not having clothes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">is fashion&#39;s not like but like you need</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">you need calories and nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">society&#39;s waking up to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">things at the same time like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">losing work while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">tied to our survival well we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">like we&#39;re learning what</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">survival isn&#39;t and that there&#39;s no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">happiness but very little happiness</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">and real safety in the society that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">and the smoke and mirrors that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">so dedicated to keep going</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">yeah um nearly 60 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">there was a publication from club of</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible this neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">idea of never ending growth is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">possible more or less at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">there was really profound research about</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">how to develop quality lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">which is something we should talk much</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">not only lifetime we should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">quality lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">and there is a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">relation between the surface of land you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">to to live to survive in a good way</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">with good food and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">a person and we know from every</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">continent</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">and every climber zone we know this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">relation in europe the relation is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">15 000 square meter per person</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">so in our community we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">um more than this per person</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">so we can take this land we can use</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">part of it as a garden we can use</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">part of it to harvest some wood for</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">heating or cooking</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">and we can let a lot of this land</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">just as a protected</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">private space like a buffer</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">for for a future in which maybe we need</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">to change positions of some</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">so all this is knowledge known</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">accessible a lot of years i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">when i listen you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">some of these illusions are specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">illusions of the middle class</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">the the younger dogs in every society</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">they are in the survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">anyway equal if if you have instagram or</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">they don&#39;t care about facebook or a like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">or not because they need to find</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">something to eat for the next day</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">and it was not changing over the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">200 years for these people in you or in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">our society</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">so the upper class also they</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">they they have the cake and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">understand that not everybody has cake</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">like this famous quote of this french</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">princess so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">it was a middle class and the middle</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">class was</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">convinced by making money</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">following this this pass</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">to solve everything in an individual way</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">and now they realize it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">i think 10 years ago i made an artwork</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">quoted</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">i think therefore ib</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">as as an old quote i changed</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">or i felt i have to change</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">in i upload to be so</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">a lot of people in this middle class um</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">they feel really dead if they lose</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">their facebook account or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">social media access</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">so i think this is something which has</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">um to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">evaluated and we have to find</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">a different answer to why we are on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">planet i would not say that we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">less to do there is less work it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">paid work so when i look</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">out of the window 50 in germany</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">of what i see when i look out of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">window</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">is done by people</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">on a basis of a volunteer who just</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">offer something for the public for</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">a kind of community cleaning the street</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">taking some rubbish out of the park</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">nothing of this is paid</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">working with kids football teams leading</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">football teams</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">all these jobs are unpaid and all this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">part of this beauty what i see when i</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">look outside of this window</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">so 50 of what i see</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">was already not paid anymore</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">but it is the reality and if i want this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">um i i i should not think about reducing</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">work i should think about redefining</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">what it means to live to be my values</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">um and to find um</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">a contract in the community of a society</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">which leads to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">to quality lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">i had a note here and i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">it actually says</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">farming go back to farming that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">um that is exactly what i mean when i</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">mean the end of work</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean the end like we all get to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">sit around have unlimited leisure time</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">although yes that&#39;s also what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">that labor isn&#39;t done we just choose to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">use our labor</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">for our and our collective benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">we get to choose instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">tied to survival</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">right that we have to change the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">survival is so intimately</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">intertwined with our work our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">being is intimately intertwined with</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">and so if we&#39;re losing work and we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">kind of collectively on an economic</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">level right like small businesses are</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">going under</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.960" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">big corporations are taking more of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">power in jobs and therefore they have</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">more collective power to pay us less and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">and things are being automated and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s real and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">we still need the same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">calories we still have art we still have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">like there&#39;s never an</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">end to that and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">again our history of society that we did</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">all used to be farmers and it was a hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">arduous life</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like that leave that to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">them and we get to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">you know we we&#39;re on instagram instead</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">of actually having our hands in the dirt</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">when really</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a quality to life about having</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">your hands in the dirt</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">that you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">through it like you can&#39;t get that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">like you can&#39;t go to the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">market and get the satisfaction of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">growing your own food</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just not they&#39;re not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">but what we hear</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">as people on instagram in game a is you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">want me to go back to toi like my my</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">life is so intimately tied all i know is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">instagram all i know is this like very</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">particular work function i can only type</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">i can do excel spreadsheets i can do</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">like that&#39;s not growing in food and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">you want me to do is give that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">up to go back it&#39;s like no we can get</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">this needs met as a as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">right as however big your collective is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">one to billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">we can get our needs met and then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">can choose to focus</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to get their needs met so</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">they&#39;re in survival mode looking for</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">really needed in this new world and yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">i could use someone&#39;s instagram skills</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">to do what i&#39;m doing but like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">something about the people are in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">and they feel like when you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">them or getting into game b</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">whatever their version of game b is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to give up everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">that they care about</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s not true they actually get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">hell of a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">right like like i said there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">something about growing your own food</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">that gives you something if you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">forced to that&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">you have to toil in the fields for 40</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">hours it&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">as a collective we&#39;re doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing the food and we get good</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">food and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">you get to be in community and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">there&#39;s just there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t put it in a textbook right</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">like you have to be in it to get that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s something yeah but i i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">you can say something about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">tragedy of the people so if you see all</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">this like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">labyrinth and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">arrive to an area</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">where you can try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">to explore</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">game b like alternative entities</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">and constructions so you want to go out</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">this game a you feel this</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">emptiness so you are searching for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">right way if you see it like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">so um every time you have the decision</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">to the left to the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">straight ahead so you do this and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">in a in a on a in front of a wall you</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">you have to go back so what you do in</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">your strategy is you go back</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">as long as you don&#39;t meet an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">road you could go then</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">you take the alternative row if</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t work as</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">the first one you step back deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">so you go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">um to to the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">previous decision and you do this as</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">long as you need to do it to find</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">another way</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">so my big question for game b</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">where is the relation between game a and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">money and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">game b and money</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">how deep i need to go back okay um</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">to find game b and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">thesis is um it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t help us to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">to find the better construction of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">or to find the better construction of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">the association</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:14.210" style="s2">or to find the better construction of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">another entity who produce something</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.210" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">if all is calculated by money and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">money is the currency to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">benefits losses</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">advantages disadvantages and so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">uh we we don&#39;t arrive</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">so when you first brought up the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">labyrinth one you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">going back and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">you take the other alternative route my</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">brain was like well what if the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">option was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">right like if there&#39;s two you can go</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">left or right and you go right</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re never making it to the center</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">of the labyrinth because left was the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">way right so every other way that you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">you have to get back to that very first</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">choice to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">pick the right way i think game b is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">a physical</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">structure of a labyrinth where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">trying to get to the center</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">it is a ever-changing labyrinth where if</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">you ch</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">if you chose the wrong version to begin</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">rearranging itself to help you find the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">right one</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">and so there is something about trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">like if we&#39;re just trying to fix game a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very much that it&#39;s going back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">one fourth and being like okay let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">this little tweak let&#39;s try this out</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">and thinking that like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">about then the other options to go back</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">to the first one and take the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">instead of the left or vice versa um</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something about game b that has</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">to work within game a so it has to work</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">within the labyrinth that was created to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">but what we don&#39;t realize is there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s this nebulous flowing thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">actually helps us figure it out and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">can&#39;t even get to that metaphor within</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">the labyrinth because</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">it breaks the labyrinth you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">mean like if a labyrinth is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">changing and there&#39;s no point in getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">to the center it&#39;s not a labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s not one solution it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">let&#39;s put it um let&#39;s try it in another</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">to be able to have any sensation</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">of being more close to game b</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">you need the kind of memory</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">and knowledge you already received</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">in your life to be able to evaluate this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">so in one social network conversation i</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">a woman do you ever experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">a game b like relation</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">between you and somebody else</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">and it turns it into a transaction where</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">i&#39;m your employee</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">instead of and yet they have money and i</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">right we know this for that and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a different like i&#39;m like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">looking for everywhere that i can give</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">within my capacity while finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">to get my needs met without necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">tying them together</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">and society is not big on that though</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">right like and this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">survival versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">fullness is my wholeness is very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">both i&#39;m in survival and wholeness both</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">constantly and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:15.359" style="s2">my unique gift on this planet i believe</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">is to help create game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.359" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">but in a way that&#39;s like i&#39;m not whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">by myself i can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">i have to fit with other people to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">able to do a project to be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">in community to be able to do those</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">and um that to me is game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">like it&#39;s not one person being able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">do everything okay i got the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">labyrinth let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do we come together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">actually figure out governance how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">come together and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">solve things how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">um figure it out from this space because</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">this is the other thing with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">labyrinth one</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">is capitalism is very or what i game a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">is very much we have a problem so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">solve it that&#39;s a right or a left and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">then you need to go back to it so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">money is one of the first turns right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">yes money is completely broken but in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">fix money you&#39;d have to go back so far</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;d break all of society</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">because as we&#39;ve taken these turns we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">designed society around them right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">like well we need money so now</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">everything&#39;s focused on money</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">but there is a way to restructure the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">labyrinth within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">like to create game b within game a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">we&#39;re using money against</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">itself um and then eventually game a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">goes away because game b has created</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">something that is omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">and etsy rivalries and game a can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">compete with that they just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">but it has to be done from within this</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">current one and it&#39;s hard because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">in a physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">labyrinth and what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">get to the center and we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s moving and changing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">nebulous and like you can&#39;t go back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">then take a different fork because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">makes everything else</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">fall away and so you have to change you</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">have to take all the forks at the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">right you can&#39;t just you can&#39;t really go</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">back and take that other fork</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">you have to go back and take the money</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">forward and do this for can do that for</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">because our entire society is set up</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">like that way and otherwise we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">gonna get into tribal mode and be at war</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">with each other and ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">so there has to be a way to within</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">safety and um</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">happiness within feeling like where our</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">needs are met</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">be able to figure out that labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">together and luckily</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">the universe is kind of there to help</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">with that in a way but it takes a faith</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">to believe that like it takes it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">it shows up that it continually happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">that way like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">i&#39;m someone who wants the labyrinth i</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">want to figure it out logically</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">map it and give it to everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">it can&#39;t it&#39;s not that way it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">different path for everyone to get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re not even getting into the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">uh okay so our experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">in familia feliz in this little</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">need money</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">to regulate something and we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">in money it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">we are not a part of game a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:12.000" style="s2">societies and communities so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">to pay water to pay light and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">but the general aspect</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">is that we try to establish</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">relations between people which are</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">for me game bae like game b like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">relations like the relation between a</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t give birth and put a debt on</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">the bank account of your kid</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">you it&#39;s not a college uh situation</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">for your personal benefit you do this</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">because you want</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">is free to do it and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">are freelancers or employees</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">or they run little companies</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">but they do this on a personal level but</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">on the level of the community</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t think in terms of money</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">we think in terms of donation and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">like with this sample with the mother</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">and the kid</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">it turns out that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">empower each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">we create more liberty for each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">on the midterm and on a long term</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">and even now in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">the corona crisis of this lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">our experience is we have much</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">more quality of life than others</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">because this way of not</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">following the money means that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">um we are not so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">touched by what happened now in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">because a lot of things a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">networks</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">are already established without</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">this uh this for that without</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">these deals without this looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">the benefit or for the advantage so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">we didn&#39;t try to optimize the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">we tried to optimize this</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">liberty and um this</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">the social behavior and even the joy and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">the happiness</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">embedded in donating something without</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">and um this looks</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">now looking backwards as</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">as a very nice protection in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">uh situation so</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">survival to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">like being able to survive in a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">state is being able to have my</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">very basic needs met whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">individually or collectively i know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">can&#39;t meet them individually so i need</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">to make them meet them collectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something in society that we did</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:59.839" style="s2">right this specialization</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">has given us game a in a very big way</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.839" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a good side to that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">maybe not so good side to that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">specialization has given us</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">what we have right if we if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">have electric shit we wouldn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">have engineers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">fixers and such but i like having</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">electronic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">like there&#39;s a certain level of having</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">the complexity and the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">means we need specialization because my</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">question is what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">independence</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">um that every person has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">feed themselves even without the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">community within the community or</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">like with this trade-off of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">specialization and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">what do you mean by independence</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">independence in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">my view is</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">the relation between</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">two people inside embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">and between one of this person</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">focusing the community as an entity</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">and in both ways um i want to expand</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">independence and um i can do this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">from the side of the community if</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">everything which is organized</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">is organized in the way that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">to dependence and on the individual way</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">i can do this if i for example donate</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">without expectation which means</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">there is no payback there is no risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">there is no risk to take</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">because there is no balance sheet</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">i have to to follow later on</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">this is a way of independence and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:58.839" style="s2">other independence</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.839" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">try to find a balance between his own</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">on one side and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">on the other side the needs</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">of other members in the community</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m able to do what i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">should learn because i see there is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">inside of the community</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">this is something</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">which is on my individual side and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">finally everybody take the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">hours in the garden and everybody take</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">uh screen time uh making programmation</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">uh and so on and so on uh no it means</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">that um everybody try</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">first what is easy for him</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">to do this is uh very efficient</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">uh because he need less time than</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">and the second is to see okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">if we need a plumber and nobody is able</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">who might be willing to learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing but everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">of this um is um</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">based on this general idea like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">in your situation as a mother with a kid</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">you want the maximum of independence for</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">your kid</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">you want to charge it with knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">you want to give a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">and you want to release it with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">maximum</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">what you can gather</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">and this is our</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">approach in the relation between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">and an individual member of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">this is this form of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">independence we like to see in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">and if if it&#39;s a guru driven</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">community for sure you will not find</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">because this project</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">should not</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">end with independent followers</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">it should end with with a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">hierarchy and dependence and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">what we what we want</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because part of and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:51.680" style="s2">this is something i wanted to get into</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">from reading your article this last week</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">but maybe we&#39;ll make it for the topic</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">next week because we&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">down to the hour um of that you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">said something but like you never really</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">do anything for the community itself you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">only do things for other individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking of the community i&#39;m part</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">of and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">what like there&#39;s somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">amazing at the compost it&#39;s like his</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">genius and he&#39;s doing it constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">um if he left that is a role that would</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">lost your right arm you lost</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">your ability you know like your</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">cognitive ability you gained this</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">skill you lost this one that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">flow to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">a lot a lot of people they they uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">invent a kind of narrative for a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">this narrative narrative could be</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">religion for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">or health or other topics</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">and um you want to gather the people you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">want to bind the people to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">because you try to invent something</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">which is higher than the person</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:28.839" style="s2">and we don&#39;t do this we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">nothing of this um</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">uh we and and this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">peace and the kind of happiness</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">we we can realize</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">out of this independence so</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">so what when you make it in in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">sentence what is um</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">the question for the next session i</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:57.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t make it in the form of a question</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">but the topic is individual versus</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">sounds wrong but individual in community</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">right the individual and the group i</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:05.680" style="s2">integral work</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">but the idea that like you transcend and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.680" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">include an</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">individual versus the group but like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">community this is going to go against a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:12.720" style="s2">little bit what you&#39;re saying but like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">the community is itself an individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">right and then it&#39;s a it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">bigger community of communities</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">theoretically whether it&#39;s part of it or</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">not right there&#39;s other communities to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">interact with</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">there&#39;s the individual but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">like you make up a bunch of communities</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:28.559" style="s2">your heart and your nervous system or</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">your you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.559" end="00:57:32.640" style="s2">church community like that there&#39;s parts</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">of the individual in parts of the group</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">so i realized i just made a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">big sentence the topic is individual and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">and encompassing that right that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">this is the topic to be do we transcend</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">and include</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">right do we have is the community its</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">own entity</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:52.559" style="s2">is there a benefit to looking at it as</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">its own entity and i like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.559" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">going where i haven&#39;t even thought like</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">of not necessarily having in its own</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">entity because it gives it</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">a different quality which i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:03.839" style="s2">like yeah okay i get that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">and so getting into that individual and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.839" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">the community</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:08.319" style="s2">whose role what right is the community</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">just a group of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">individuals just people seeking</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:14.319" style="s2">community like</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">what is what makes one what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.319" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">other what are the</p>
