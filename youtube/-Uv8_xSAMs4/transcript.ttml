<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:09.690" style="s2">with rebecky I&#39;m joined again by my good</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.770" end="00:00:12.990" style="s2">friend lemon Pascal some of you probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.690" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">saw the earlier discussion I had with</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.990" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">lemon lemon is an important figure</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">within the metter modern movement and if</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">you saw the last video you know he</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">brings a very eloquent and theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">sophisticated articulation to his</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">understanding and practice of meta</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:34.430" style="s2">modernism and using that as a framework</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">with which to respond to issues such as</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.430" end="00:00:38.940" style="s2">like the Kovach crisis and the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">crisis so welcome again I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">really good to have you here really good</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:44.750" style="s2">to see you again too John always nice to</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">talk with you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.750" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">let me tell you what&#39;s been on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">this morning</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">they have you picked from among them and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">will go down one of those pathways sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">sure sure so I&#39;m thinking about how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">generalized set of shamanic practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">maps on pretty nicely to what the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">of humanity might need oh it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">about the kind of the mechanics of split</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">attention mm-hmm how that applies to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">developmental practice you know practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:18.259" style="s2">I&#39;m also thinking a lot about the danger</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">of superficiality and meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.259" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">dangerous shallowness of values and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">whether things you know something</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">inhibits the process by which meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">actually becomes an embodied experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">yeah now we could have all the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">meaning at our disposal but if it stays</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">at the surface what good is it all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">right right that&#39;s what&#39;s on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">today um well I find all of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">interesting so let&#39;s try and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">all of them but let&#39;s start with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">last one because it&#39;s always good to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.990" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">start with meaning I think it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a good place it usually sets up</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">your thinking for everything else so one</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">of those you know I think about this a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">lot too and I get asked questions about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">you know the dark side of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">and and of course that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">relevant because I argue that the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">meaning making machinery is also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">self deception machinery this why this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:15.320" style="s2">is why I try to strongly</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:18.410" style="s2">she ate an integrate meaning with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.320" end="00:02:19.610" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom precisely</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.410" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">because I think the meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.610" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">machinery well it does give us the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">connectedness the religio you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.900" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">kindness to herself each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:29.750" style="s2">world that enhances meaning in life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:32.330" style="s2">also this very same machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.750" end="00:02:35.000" style="s2">predisposes us towards bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.330" end="00:02:37.430" style="s2">ourselves and deceiving ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.000" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">that&#39;s an argument I have for why I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.430" end="00:02:41.410" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:43.910" style="s2">necessity I think it&#39;s a practical</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.410" end="00:02:45.800" style="s2">constitutive necessity that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.910" end="00:02:47.600" style="s2">cultivation of meaning and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.800" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom should be done in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.600" end="00:02:54.530" style="s2">a completely interdependent manner so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:02:57.740" style="s2">from your point of view what do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">think are the mechanisms involved in you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.740" end="00:03:01.700" style="s2">know there&#39;s this first step where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:03.950" style="s2">recognize something you say hey that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.700" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">could give me some meaning that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.950" end="00:03:10.490" style="s2">meaning all over it I agree I assert of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">value or I perform a practice and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.490" end="00:03:15.170" style="s2">right there for me I could tell someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:18.709" style="s2">else yeah but I&#39;ve got this thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.170" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">enhancing meaning for me but how does</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.709" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">that what are the mechanics of embodying</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:24.950" style="s2">that and taking that deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:27.739" style="s2">assimilating that because it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.950" end="00:03:29.239" style="s2">a lot of people stop at the first stage</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.739" end="00:03:31.700" style="s2">somehow if that&#39;s the right metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.239" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2">yeah I think that is it correct metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.700" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">and part of what&#39;s going on there I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.620" end="00:03:39.410" style="s2">think is modal confusion and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:41.480" style="s2">attributing this to you but it fits the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.410" end="00:03:43.820" style="s2">description or people get focused on an</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">experience they&#39;ve had all right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.820" end="00:03:51.080" style="s2">they have this object and the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:53.150" style="s2">about that is I think that&#39;s that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.080" end="00:03:56.450" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s modal confusion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.150" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">missing what is most important about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.450" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">experience and you&#39;re trying to have it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:03.230" style="s2">and recapture it again and again you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">missing the capacity to not look at it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.230" end="00:04:07.130" style="s2">but look through it and see what you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">learn from it that is transferable to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.130" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">other situations and so you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">you know let me use you know a martial</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:21.320" style="s2">art analogy like you find this stance</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:22.729" style="s2">and you do this move and oh wow and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.320" end="00:04:23.310" style="s2">just keep going back to that again and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.729" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">again and again</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.310" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not very good what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:30.060" style="s2">need to do is try and spar with it right</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:32.850" style="s2">trying spar with it put it into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.060" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">problem that is beyond the comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.850" end="00:04:37.950" style="s2">zone that the experience is giving you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">and see if it facilitates insight and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.950" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">transfer and learning and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">challenge for you in so far I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">Buddha warns about this you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:50.760" style="s2">consistently and it&#39;s something that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:52.680" style="s2">Western Buddhists don&#39;t pick up on you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.760" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">are not supposed to be pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">contentedness or self-satisfaction or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.350" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">even sort of wonderful feelings the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:05.660" style="s2">point about this right is transformation</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">the point about this is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.660" end="00:05:12.389" style="s2">cultivated you realize in it a potential</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:13.770" style="s2">for a skill that can be cultivated that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.389" end="00:05:16.350" style="s2">can be applied throughout your life you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.770" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be pursuing contentedness that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">that&#39;s you know he worries about you</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:22.380" style="s2">know the contentedness of cabbages or</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:24.570" style="s2">something like that there&#39;s a writer</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.380" end="00:05:28.500" style="s2">just with people who and what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.570" end="00:05:30.510" style="s2">they they get obsessed with it and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.500" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s even in some versions</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.510" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">of the quest for the Holy Grail the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:37.950" style="s2">quest is found not when they find the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">object but when they realize what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.950" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">Grail stands for and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:44.370" style="s2">supposed to change their whole view on</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:48.229" style="s2">life in their whole way of being so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.370" end="00:05:51.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.229" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">practices that see if you can translate</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.150" end="00:06:00.030" style="s2">it into well into a way of embodying it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.960" end="00:06:02.729" style="s2">but also much more importantly a way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.030" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">enacting it so for example let me let so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.729" end="00:06:05.310" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking just abstract</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">abstractly let me give one concrete</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.310" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">example of what I&#39;m talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:11.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very dangerous when people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:13.139" style="s2">meditating to think that sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.160" end="00:06:15.690" style="s2">the point is to get away from their life</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.139" end="00:06:16.919" style="s2">and into this wonderful space and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.690" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">then they want to get back to there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.919" end="00:06:20.850" style="s2">it can be a wonderful space right and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">really warn against that and I tell</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.840" end="00:08:23.880" style="s2">apply the principle that you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.000" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">accepted right and I like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.880" end="00:08:29.430" style="s2">about the you know the orientation</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:32.400" style="s2">towards comfort has a danger in it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.430" end="00:08:35.540" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very similar to saying people</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.400" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">are lazy because there&#39;s a I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.540" end="00:08:41.460" style="s2">unnatural organismic reluctance to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">engage in effort in general because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.460" end="00:08:45.330" style="s2">an energy expenditure I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:47.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a beautiful like</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.330" end="00:08:48.900" style="s2">historical moment where Noam Chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.400" end="00:08:50.200" style="s2">defended this guy who&#39;d written these</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.900" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">Holocaust denial</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.200" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">yeah reporter said to him you know why</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.020" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">did you do this and he said free speech</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:00.520" style="s2">only applies to things that you find</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:02.860" style="s2">abhorrent otherwise it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.520" end="00:09:05.290" style="s2">invoked yet yeah right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.860" end="00:09:06.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a difficulty in embodying a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.290" end="00:09:09.640" style="s2">principle it&#39;s very easy to affirm a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.760" end="00:09:12.040" style="s2">principle and I&#39;m assuming just because</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.640" end="00:09:14.230" style="s2">we try to conserve system resources in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.040" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">ourselves that we would be reluctant to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.230" end="00:09:19.480" style="s2">make the effort often that actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">would bring a meaningful value forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:24.070" style="s2">into practice right and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">gets to the next things very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.070" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">I mean Stanovich Keith Stanovich they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:30.580" style="s2">sort of the one of the premier research</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">surface on rationality talks about what</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.580" end="00:09:34.330" style="s2">he calls the cognitive miser that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:36.030" style="s2">brain is always trying to get as much as</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.330" end="00:09:38.590" style="s2">it can for as little effort as it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.030" end="00:09:41.080" style="s2">and the thing about that is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.590" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">practice active open mindedness you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.080" end="00:09:47.350" style="s2">to keep noting instances where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">doing that and then challenge it when it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.350" end="00:09:51.520" style="s2">becomes apparent that that often is you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:54.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s often locking you into</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.520" end="00:09:56.200" style="s2">superficial short-term goals rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.310" end="00:10:00.210" style="s2">long-term deeper cause so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.200" end="00:10:05.230" style="s2">practice that but let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.210" end="00:10:07.540" style="s2">the things that empower and encourage</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.230" end="00:10:11.650" style="s2">people so you also teach people in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.540" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">practice of integration again I&#39;ll use a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.650" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">Buddhist framework discuss if I started</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">there I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s exclusive or</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:19.330" style="s2">exhaustive or anything ridiculous like</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.820" style="s2">that just using it because I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.330" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">brought it up so it&#39;s good continuity so</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.820" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">you trained you you trained people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">also practice the Buddha the Dharma and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">the Sangha the Buddha doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:30.760" style="s2">learning about Saturday Gotama</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:33.130" style="s2">that&#39;s not a waste of time that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.760" end="00:10:34.330" style="s2">thing to do but what it means is when</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.130" end="00:10:36.070" style="s2">you&#39;re doing those moments of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.330" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">integration take note of them and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.070" end="00:10:40.390" style="s2">literally mean take note of them write</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">them down and celebrate the moments of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.390" end="00:10:45.490" style="s2">insight so as you know if you keeping a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:46.960" style="s2">journal of all you where you&#39;ve caught</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.490" end="00:10:49.960" style="s2">yourself in self-deception you can just</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.960" end="00:10:51.850" style="s2">expand this right don&#39;t just know where</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.960" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">you were self deceived and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.850" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">realize it also note where you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:10:58.150" style="s2">insightful or you you sort of cut</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:00.220" style="s2">through to what was really the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.150" end="00:11:01.630" style="s2">zero most relevant so this is called</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.220" end="00:11:03.820" style="s2">water in your Buddha it&#39;s like a plant</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.630" end="00:11:06.310" style="s2">and we you have to act</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.820" end="00:11:10.330" style="s2">we celebrate this so that it goes from</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.330" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">within you I&#39;m not claiming anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.820" end="00:11:15.550" style="s2">metaphysical here I&#39;m just saying there</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:17.860" style="s2">it starts to how it starts to get a</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.860" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">teacher thing and that starts going the</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.030" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">I&#39;m pitching them as instrumental they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.010" end="00:12:37.530" style="s2">also have intrinsic worth rewards for</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:40.210" style="s2">them so it&#39;s nice to get that sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.530" end="00:12:43.390" style="s2">celebrate that sense like it feels good</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.210" end="00:12:44.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the brain goes whoo right and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.390" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">when you&#39;re learning new stuff you bring</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.740" end="00:12:49.960" style="s2">those oh and you know and then meeting</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:52.180" style="s2">with other people and experiencing what</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.960" end="00:12:54.550" style="s2">you have aptly called overflow or at</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.180" end="00:12:57.220" style="s2">least trajectory towards that is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.550" end="00:13:00.370" style="s2">deeply deeply motivating to people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.220" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">so I think what you need to do is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.370" end="00:13:04.420" style="s2">you have your practice sort of built a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:05.980" style="s2">model here then you have integration</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.420" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">practices the cultivation of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:10.060" style="s2">and then you have these comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:13.800" style="s2">practices that are designed to keep you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.060" end="00:13:13.800" style="s2">aspiring and keep you motivated</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.699" end="00:13:24.429" style="s2">I love all of that it sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.670" end="00:13:26.290" style="s2">applies very well to embodying a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.429" end="00:13:29.489" style="s2">making principle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:33.059" style="s2">well I&#39;m also thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.489" end="00:13:35.290" style="s2">assimilation of perceptions hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.059" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">right there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.290" end="00:13:38.499" style="s2">familiar you are with your Jeff Ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:41.350" style="s2">but they have this beautiful phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.499" end="00:13:43.569" style="s2">food of impressions sounds in US only as</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.350" end="00:13:46.299" style="s2">dough and dough is the first note on an</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.569" end="00:13:49.419" style="s2">octave of assimilation all right right</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.299" end="00:13:52.239" style="s2">so that they there&#39;s a potential energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.419" end="00:13:55.089" style="s2">and stimulation an incoming possibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.239" end="00:13:58.179" style="s2">for salience now engage just by</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.089" end="00:13:59.739" style="s2">beholding something but in general we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.179" end="00:14:02.259" style="s2">either get carried away by the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.739" end="00:14:06.489" style="s2">perception or there&#39;s a kind of flatness</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.259" end="00:14:10.029" style="s2">to our beholding so you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.489" end="00:14:12.489" style="s2">think of more deeply assimilating</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.029" end="00:14:14.350" style="s2">perception so I&#39;ve been putting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.489" end="00:14:16.839" style="s2">thought into that right now to in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.350" end="00:14:19.899" style="s2">connection with there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.839" end="00:14:21.790" style="s2">synchronicity between us here yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.899" end="00:14:25.350" style="s2">been putting a lot of thought into that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.790" end="00:14:27.549" style="s2">because of dialectic and ear logos</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.350" end="00:14:30.970" style="s2">because and this is actually germane to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.549" end="00:14:35.649" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.970" end="00:14:39.549" style="s2">excellent point it&#39;s made by Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.649" end="00:14:41.110" style="s2">Moore a belief or I think Sarah I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.549" end="00:14:43.689" style="s2">wrap it makes the same point anyways</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.110" end="00:14:45.819" style="s2">when when you&#39;re in you know Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.689" end="00:14:49.569" style="s2">dialectic it&#39;s not just that arguments</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.819" end="00:14:52.029" style="s2">are being compared the the deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.569" end="00:14:53.829" style="s2">actually is an exemplification of a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.029" end="00:14:56.589" style="s2">of life Socrates is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.829" end="00:14:58.360" style="s2">exemplifying a way of life and in in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.589" end="00:15:00.189" style="s2">in comparison to other ways of life</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.360" end="00:15:03.179" style="s2">because for Socrates ways of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.189" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">argumentation and ways of life are bound</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.179" end="00:15:09.339" style="s2">deeply together and then what you see is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:11.649" style="s2">but that&#39;s why beauty is invoked so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.339" end="00:15:14.199" style="s2">often beauty and love you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.649" end="00:15:15.189" style="s2">one of Spinoza&#39;s great insights right in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.199" end="00:15:17.319" style="s2">the ethic he said you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.189" end="00:15:19.389" style="s2">thing that will will you compete against</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.319" end="00:15:21.009" style="s2">an emotion is another emotion all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.389" end="00:15:22.989" style="s2">you can think all you want but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.009" end="00:15:25.929" style="s2">haven&#39;t cultivated love you doomed right</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.989" end="00:15:28.590" style="s2">and I think that and Plato reports</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.929" end="00:15:31.170" style="s2">completely consonant with that as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.590" end="00:15:34.110" style="s2">and so I am getting to the point what</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.170" end="00:15:36.980" style="s2">that all comes down to is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.110" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">role that the practice of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.980" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">beautification of a way of life and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:47.510" style="s2">and and what that requires is that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.510" end="00:15:51.990" style="s2">in addition to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:53.820" style="s2">practicalities of what I said there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.990" end="00:15:56.390" style="s2">philosophical critique that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.820" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">engaged in because of a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.390" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">misrepresentation han in his book saving</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">Beauty criticizes how we have reduced</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">Beauty right to because it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:13.470" style="s2">aesthetics of the smooth we likes things</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:15.810" style="s2">smooth and shiny because what we want is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.470" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">we want things that in no way disrupt us</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.810" end="00:16:20.640" style="s2">or disturb us we want things that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">readily and eat we want things we want</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.640" end="00:16:26.250" style="s2">things to flow smoothly and we want we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:27.900" style="s2">were like smooth objects and we like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.250" end="00:16:29.940" style="s2">know our technology to have a smooth</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.900" end="00:16:31.650" style="s2">like an and he talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.940" end="00:16:34.230" style="s2">aesthetic of smoothness and in any sets</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.650" end="00:16:36.780" style="s2">and we confuse it with beauty we confuse</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.230" end="00:16:39.300" style="s2">it with beauty we what we what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.780" end="00:16:43.350" style="s2">reduced Beauty to is ease of consumption</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.300" end="00:16:47.610" style="s2">ease of use and that of course is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.350" end="00:16:51.300" style="s2">remove a lot of what you know is central</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.610" end="00:16:54.510" style="s2">to beauty we wait when you read other</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.300" end="00:16:57.480" style="s2">people like Plato or you know Ellen</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.510" end="00:17:00.740" style="s2">scurries book arm on beauty all right</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.480" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">there&#39;s this older sense of beauty that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.740" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">is captured when like when we say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:09.630" style="s2">struck by beauty we&#39;re struck by it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:13.020" style="s2">right it&#39;s disruptive Rilke and one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.630" end="00:17:16.050" style="s2">the elegies says you know beauty is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.020" end="00:17:17.640" style="s2">sense of you know something like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.050" end="00:17:22.230" style="s2">sense of terror of an angel that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.640" end="00:17:28.800" style="s2">almost killing us right and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.230" end="00:17:32.940" style="s2">what it is is to try to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.800" end="00:17:38.010" style="s2">to beautify the serious play that is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:41.610" style="s2">just training a skill but is cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.010" end="00:17:42.600" style="s2">a an attractive way of life for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.610" end="00:17:48.899" style="s2">and for other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.600" end="00:17:52.950" style="s2">and so what that does I think what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.899" end="00:17:55.169" style="s2">does is it starts to move us off of what</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.950" end="00:17:58.769" style="s2">you I think you&#39;re calling a superficial</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.169" end="00:18:04.169" style="s2">response to our perceptual experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.769" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">and it starts to move us towards you</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.169" end="00:18:07.950" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t generate beauty but what</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:11.970" style="s2">you can do is make yourself more and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.950" end="00:18:14.279" style="s2">more receptive and open to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.970" end="00:18:16.909" style="s2">the way you relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.279" end="00:18:19.590" style="s2">when it&#39;s when you experience it try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.909" end="00:18:21.059" style="s2">see it&#39;s the exact opposite in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.590" end="00:18:23.549" style="s2">right so our model funds right</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.059" end="00:18:26.029" style="s2">consumptive model the smoothness for</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.549" end="00:18:30.090" style="s2">Plato beauty is the doorstep to awe and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.029" end="00:18:35.190" style="s2">for Plato you don&#39;t consume Beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">beauty beauty inspires you to create he</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.190" end="00:18:38.789" style="s2">says you want to give birth to Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:45.059" style="s2">within Beauty the experience of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.789" end="00:18:49.080" style="s2">is a genuine experience of the impulse</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.059" end="00:18:52.409" style="s2">towards generativity and also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.080" end="00:18:54.899" style="s2">aspirational that the eros is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.409" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">consumptive eros its generative eros and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.899" end="00:18:59.489" style="s2">it&#39;s the move towards you know hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:04.919" style="s2">generating for yourself and others a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.489" end="00:19:08.039" style="s2">of life so I think really formulating</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.919" end="00:19:11.340" style="s2">what Beauty means to us because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.039" end="00:19:13.139" style="s2">normativity operating I think on our on</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.340" end="00:19:15.899" style="s2">receptor or perceptual world the word</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.139" end="00:19:19.139" style="s2">aesthetics relates to sensation right</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.899" end="00:19:20.850" style="s2">I think rehabilitating and I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.139" end="00:19:22.739" style="s2">in the sense of both reformulating yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.850" end="00:19:24.989" style="s2">and make it making it habitable for us</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.739" end="00:19:27.119" style="s2">again rehabilitating beauty and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.989" end="00:19:30.210" style="s2">turning it into a practice where we</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.119" end="00:19:33.239" style="s2">cultivate the receptivity to it and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.210" end="00:19:34.830" style="s2">cultivate the responsibility to it the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.239" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">generative response rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.830" end="00:19:39.179" style="s2">consumptive impulse I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">powerful way and you see it through</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.179" end="00:19:43.019" style="s2">there lots of different thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:45.629" style="s2">converge on this idea but like I said</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.019" end="00:19:51.989" style="s2">Plato is in this respect my greatest</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.629" end="00:19:55.080" style="s2">card so I think we just like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.989" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">trying to open up expand of the notion</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.080" end="00:20:00.870" style="s2">of realness with the fork</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:05.730" style="s2">of knowing I I think we need to get back</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.870" end="00:20:09.480" style="s2">to beauty and in an in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.730" end="00:20:13.410" style="s2">directly translates into the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.480" end="00:20:17.490" style="s2">for wisdom you make me think of two</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.410" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">things and there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.490" end="00:20:21.540" style="s2">tension in spiritual religious history</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.680" end="00:20:24.450" style="s2">between the personal and the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.540" end="00:20:26.760" style="s2">force of course I very often very often</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.450" end="00:20:29.070" style="s2">it&#39;s presented to us as a journey away</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.760" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">from the personal toward the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.070" end="00:20:33.540" style="s2">alright even as a journey away from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:36.540" style="s2">embodied to the utterly abstract yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.540" end="00:20:39.030" style="s2">yeah and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.540" end="00:20:42.450" style="s2">talking about consciousness practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.030" end="00:20:45.150" style="s2">which is similar in wersal and that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.450" end="00:20:47.250" style="s2">you should learn to pay perfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.150" end="00:20:49.650" style="s2">attention to everything no matter what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.250" end="00:20:51.810" style="s2">arising you&#39;re learn to practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.650" end="00:20:53.670" style="s2">intentionally noticing anything and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.810" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">these are really useful practices</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.670" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">however they&#39;re distinct from a practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:02.430" style="s2">of impressions rather than perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:04.590" style="s2">because the impression impresses you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.430" end="00:21:09.180" style="s2">you&#39;re struck by something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.590" end="00:21:12.020" style="s2">peculiar to your sense making system you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.180" end="00:21:15.630" style="s2">could practice attending mindfully to an</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.020" end="00:21:17.040" style="s2">arbitrary stimulus on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.630" end="00:21:20.370" style="s2">could practice attending to something</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.040" end="00:21:23.460" style="s2">that your system has contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.370" end="00:21:25.590" style="s2">evoking as a particular unique</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.460" end="00:21:28.050" style="s2">impression of the world that stands out</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.590" end="00:21:30.750" style="s2">to you and has come halfway to draw you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:32.310" style="s2">forward toward it yeah that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.750" end="00:21:37.560" style="s2">what I was trying to articulate with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.310" end="00:21:40.890" style="s2">with the notion of beauty so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.560" end="00:21:42.510" style="s2">relevance realization machinery is sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.890" end="00:21:45.780" style="s2">of in one direction it&#39;s making things</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.510" end="00:21:48.830" style="s2">relevant to us but it&#39;s also that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.780" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">relevance realization machinery is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.830" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">vehicle through which a being can</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">realize itself put a demand on us so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:22:00.690" style="s2">these two I mean again we&#39;ve got he sees</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">the beautiful torso of Apollo and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:04.110" style="s2">the final line of the poem you must</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">change your life you must change your</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.110" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">life that&#39;s you know and what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.860" end="00:22:12.730" style="s2">yeah slaughter jerk you must change your</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.170" end="00:22:14.860" style="s2">life is written a book about this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.730" end="00:22:17.800" style="s2">response to the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.860" end="00:22:21.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I mean IIIi mean this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.800" end="00:22:25.240" style="s2">sense of what Beauty does is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.420" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">discloses it&#39;s like oh I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.240" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">things could be this way right but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">also puts a demand on you it puts a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">demand on you that I have to write I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:39.100" style="s2">have to as Plato says I have the demand</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:40.450" style="s2">on you is you have to make yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.100" end="00:22:42.610" style="s2">this zones and I do not mean this</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:44.770" style="s2">cosmetically all right you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.610" end="00:22:47.260" style="s2">yourself more beautiful right the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.770" end="00:22:49.540" style="s2">proper response to beauty is to attempt</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.260" end="00:22:51.940" style="s2">to conform to it just like the proper</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.540" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">response to any deep normative standard</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.940" end="00:23:00.670" style="s2">like realness is attempt to conform to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">it and so I think trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.670" end="00:23:06.040" style="s2">priority let&#39;s put it that way giving</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">priority to the those moments of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.040" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">and perhaps they become experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">ah but moments where you feel this</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">simultaneous thing that the reality is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:21.460" style="s2">disclosing itself in new ways to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">then there&#39;s a demand on you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.460" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">cultivate the skills that will maintain</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:29.050" style="s2">the actualization of those new</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">opportunities not so that is how I</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.050" end="00:23:36.130" style="s2">practice that is how I practice did that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:38.500" style="s2">interesting the smoothness thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.130" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">interesting to me because I think you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.500" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">know there&#39;s a critique there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:45.280" style="s2">completely valid but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:47.410" style="s2">smoothness is a pretty good definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.280" end="00:23:49.090" style="s2">of beauty from one angle and that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.410" end="00:23:52.900" style="s2">problem is nay not so much the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.090" end="00:23:54.610" style="s2">smoothness as laziness and passivity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.900" end="00:23:56.770" style="s2">how we receive smoothness that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.610" end="00:23:58.540" style="s2">have the energy or in Yashin to yet I</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:24:00.820" style="s2">think the five things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.540" end="00:24:02.560" style="s2">initially seem smooth yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s Hans intent I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.560" end="00:24:08.110" style="s2">he thinks the property of smoothness is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.770" end="00:24:09.400" style="s2">itself intrinsically dilatory us or</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.110" end="00:24:14.290" style="s2">anything like anyway there are things</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.400" end="00:24:17.530" style="s2">that should be smooth the question many</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.290" end="00:24:19.650" style="s2">things should and I&#39;ve often reached for</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.530" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">that kind of a terminology to describe</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.650" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">states that I&#39;ve been in you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">you fall into a state and fall us maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:31.049" style="s2">not the right word because you&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:33.600" style="s2">to get there but we&#39;re essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.049" end="00:24:35.340" style="s2">seamless continuity of being is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.600" end="00:24:37.260" style="s2">stands out to you in that experiential</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">moment the utter smoothness of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.260" end="00:24:41.940" style="s2">everything yeah and then when you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:43.980" style="s2">that you can look at anything and go</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.940" end="00:24:45.870" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s a smoothness in there</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.980" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">even if it seems discontinuous to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.870" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">yeah possibility of experiential</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:52.169" style="s2">smoothness that I&#39;ve confirmed in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.070" end="00:24:56.970" style="s2">other state yeah I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.169" end="00:24:59.429" style="s2">and I think well I mean I had some</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.970" end="00:25:01.350" style="s2">concerns about when I was reading that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.429" end="00:25:03.029" style="s2">passage in HoN because of you know Tai</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.350" end="00:25:04.740" style="s2">Chi Chuan and there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.029" end="00:25:06.299" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.740" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">of smoothness and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.299" end="00:25:09.480" style="s2">answered I think so readily to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:12.570" style="s2">question I don&#39;t think it&#39;s smoothness</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.480" end="00:25:14.549" style="s2">per se I think what he and he there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.570" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">things that I think should have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.549" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">aesthetic of smoothness I don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">would disagree with that either but what</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:24.120" style="s2">he&#39;s what what what he&#39;s saying though</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.220" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2">is that something else has been reduced</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.120" end="00:25:29.669" style="s2">to smoothness which is beauty and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.450" end="00:25:31.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t smoothness and it isn&#39;t reducible</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.669" end="00:25:34.889" style="s2">to beaut it to smoothness and that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.830" end="00:25:37.139" style="s2">so it&#39;s not the smoothness per se or</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.889" end="00:25:39.659" style="s2">even an aesthetic appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.139" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">smoothness in things or practices I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.659" end="00:25:45.059" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s what he&#39;s intending</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:48.090" style="s2">to convey I think what he&#39;s intending to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.059" end="00:25:50.429" style="s2">criticize is the reduction of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.090" end="00:25:55.320" style="s2">properties and all of the potential and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.429" end="00:25:57.809" style="s2">all of the power of beauty to the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.320" end="00:26:00.179" style="s2">easily consumable smooth I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.809" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">the point he&#39;s willing to address yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.179" end="00:26:04.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a Tai Chi is interesting in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:08.039" style="s2">respect because I think if a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.620" end="00:26:09.899" style="s2">people imagine what beautifying their</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.039" end="00:26:12.690" style="s2">lives would consist of they might</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.899" end="00:26:15.090" style="s2">imagine themselves making movements more</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.690" end="00:26:17.940" style="s2">in keeping with the Tai Chi style and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.090" end="00:26:19.649" style="s2">tempo yep that&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.940" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">really telling about that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.649" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">an intuition to move in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">of activity Oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.809" style="s2">however there&#39;s also a danger of getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:30.990" style="s2">trapped in the you know everything has</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.809" end="00:26:33.809" style="s2">to be slow and sattvic yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:37.100" style="s2">yeah to me I&#39;d like to use that as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.809" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">segue to one of the other topics</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.100" end="00:26:42.920" style="s2">the blending of attention streams is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:45.890" style="s2">some great interest to me and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.920" end="00:26:50.450" style="s2">things that is involved in the Taichi</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.890" end="00:26:52.910" style="s2">tempo is a sort of balance split between</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.450" end="00:26:54.830" style="s2">the part of you that&#39;s making the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.910" end="00:26:56.780" style="s2">activity and the party that&#39;s receiving</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.830" end="00:26:59.000" style="s2">feedback from the activity at the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.780" end="00:27:01.280" style="s2">moment and they get into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.000" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">experiential parity which is your</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.280" end="00:27:05.540" style="s2">internal cue that you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:06.860" style="s2">movements to your own satisfaction yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.540" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a blending of these two</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.860" end="00:27:10.580" style="s2">attentions and there&#39;s a nice balance</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.370" style="s2">between them and it seems like it pays</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.580" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">us back something as we undergo an</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.370" end="00:27:18.500" style="s2">activity yeah because I think first of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">all that&#39;s recognized in the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.500" end="00:27:24.530" style="s2">your intuition is accurate Institute</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:26.270" style="s2">which is no surprise you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.530" end="00:27:29.090" style="s2">have a really good facility with looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.270" end="00:27:30.530" style="s2">at phenomena and then intuiting and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.090" end="00:27:33.170" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that in the romantic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.530" end="00:27:37.250" style="s2">intuitive an important pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.170" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">principle therein in the tradition you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.250" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">do they talk about the two eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:46.160" style="s2">Taichi and and and and so let&#39;s play</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:48.440" style="s2">with the matter one is the eye looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.160" end="00:27:50.810" style="s2">inward sort of the introspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.440" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">introspective and an introspection and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:55.460" style="s2">interception are fused together looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:57.140" style="s2">into your mind space and feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.460" end="00:27:59.180" style="s2">your body space are fused together</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.140" end="00:28:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the inner and then the outer is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.180" end="00:28:03.050" style="s2">the tiger eyes you&#39;re not fixating on</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.040" end="00:28:05.030" style="s2">anything but you&#39;re you have an eye that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.050" end="00:28:08.180" style="s2">is like a tiger too hot it&#39;s flowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.030" end="00:28:09.650" style="s2">over continually flowing over and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.180" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">the reason why they use the two eyes is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.650" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">they&#39;re invoking the stereoscopic fusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:15.470" style="s2">metaphor you get to a state where like</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:17.150" style="s2">where they left and right you know how</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.470" end="00:28:19.310" style="s2">the left and right visual fields are</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.150" end="00:28:21.140" style="s2">fused to give you depth an added</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.310" end="00:28:23.420" style="s2">dimension to your visual experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.140" end="00:28:26.660" style="s2">that&#39;s the metaphor when you get that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.420" end="00:28:28.100" style="s2">when you get the inner right so first of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.660" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">all there&#39;s the like I say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.100" end="00:28:34.220" style="s2">dropping below are sort of culturally</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:36.920" style="s2">emphasized division between</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.220" end="00:28:38.390" style="s2">introspection and into interception</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.920" end="00:28:40.930" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.390" end="00:28:43.670" style="s2">awareness in which they are together</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.930" end="00:28:45.590" style="s2">indistinguishably interfused alright and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.670" end="00:28:48.140" style="s2">then you&#39;re like they say and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.590" end="00:28:49.430" style="s2">you&#39;re fusing that right like in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.140" end="00:28:51.050" style="s2">stereoscopic vision</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.430" end="00:28:52.670" style="s2">with the external thing and then that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.050" end="00:28:55.580" style="s2">gives you this it gives you a new depth</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.670" end="00:28:57.410" style="s2">of experience that you can&#39;t have when</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.580" end="00:28:59.180" style="s2">you&#39;re merely looking inward or merely</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.410" end="00:29:01.420" style="s2">looking outward and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.180" end="00:29:04.730" style="s2">important because I mean I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.420" end="00:29:06.230" style="s2">any enacted and expanded thing about</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.730" end="00:29:09.410" style="s2">what I talked about in the series where</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.230" end="00:29:11.870" style="s2">this model parties idea that ah that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.410" end="00:29:15.380" style="s2">perception is an action in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.870" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">trying to right find the optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.380" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">and and where we move around it where</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:23.420" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:25.880" style="s2">biggest possible de Stolte that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.420" end="00:29:27.920" style="s2">right lose too many details and try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.880" end="00:29:30.170" style="s2">get too many details that doesn&#39;t get us</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.920" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">to close that we lose the gestalt and of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.170" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">course there isn&#39;t there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:37.310" style="s2">algorithm for that because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:40.700" style="s2">ultimately optimal grip is varying</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.310" end="00:29:43.040" style="s2">according to the needs of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.700" end="00:29:45.590" style="s2">right is very like if a device to repair</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.040" end="00:29:47.300" style="s2">the button on here then the gestalt is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.590" end="00:29:49.550" style="s2">useless I need to I need to really focus</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.300" end="00:29:51.050" style="s2">in but if I want to be using it right</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.550" end="00:29:53.510" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have a different optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.050" end="00:29:55.730" style="s2">on it and I&#39;ve I been looking for it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.510" end="00:29:58.730" style="s2">my room right because I can&#39;t quite see</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.730" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">it different and so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.730" end="00:30:04.510" style="s2">I think it&#39;s tying it all together right</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:09.230" style="s2">I think what part of the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.510" end="00:30:12.530" style="s2">beauty is the experience of a new way a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.230" end="00:30:16.220" style="s2">new kind of optimal grip and this also</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.530" end="00:30:18.800" style="s2">goes back to my point that the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.220" end="00:30:22.730" style="s2">realization the enhancement of it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.800" end="00:30:24.470" style="s2">cultivating reverence and wisdom also</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.730" end="00:30:27.590" style="s2">has to go with this divided attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.470" end="00:30:30.590" style="s2">thing because it&#39;s like you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.590" end="00:30:32.540" style="s2">find the optimal grip relative to what</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.590" end="00:30:34.400" style="s2">you&#39;re finding most relevant but if your</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.540" end="00:30:36.890" style="s2">relevance realization machinery is screw</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.400" end="00:30:40.490" style="s2">it all over the place having you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.890" end="00:30:42.290" style="s2">the the stereoscopically fused streams</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.490" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">of attention can still really massively</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.290" end="00:30:47.510" style="s2">met mess you up you want an ultimate you</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.260" end="00:30:49.790" style="s2">want an optimal grip the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.510" end="00:30:52.070" style="s2">ultimate optimal grip not ultimate great</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.790" end="00:30:54.770" style="s2">optimal grip to be deeply integrated</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.070" end="00:30:56.450" style="s2">with you know an enhancement of your</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.770" end="00:30:58.160" style="s2">capacity for zeroing in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:31:01.940" style="s2">information that&#39;s what I would argue at</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.160" end="00:31:03.299" style="s2">least yeah I mean this this gripping</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.940" end="00:31:05.309" style="s2">device here is useful</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.299" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">because it&#39;s very fluid it could be used</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.309" end="00:31:10.259" style="s2">to grip in a vast array of circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">yes so it seems like we could easily get</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.259" end="00:31:17.519" style="s2">trapped in a particular bounces of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:20.100" style="s2">attention but if we could diversify</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.519" end="00:31:21.779" style="s2">weaponize that to be available to all</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.100" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">kinds of different scenarios then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.779" end="00:31:26.129" style="s2">really have something well that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.519" end="00:31:28.590" style="s2">of different issues converge for me on</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.129" end="00:31:31.799" style="s2">the notion of split attention because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.590" end="00:31:34.409" style="s2">can see it underlying almost every kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.799" end="00:31:36.179" style="s2">of historically proposed self</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.409" end="00:31:38.279" style="s2">development or spiritual practice right</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.179" end="00:31:41.609" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to add an</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.279" end="00:31:43.139" style="s2">additional point of focus into whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.609" end="00:31:44.730" style="s2">you&#39;re normally focusing on or whether</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.139" end="00:31:46.619" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna try to bring mind and heart</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.730" end="00:31:49.289" style="s2">together or whether you&#39;re gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.619" end="00:31:51.659" style="s2">balance self another in exchange or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.289" end="00:31:53.369" style="s2">left and right brain or the you know all</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.659" end="00:31:57.299" style="s2">these things involves some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.369" end="00:31:59.070" style="s2">negotiated balancing that seems to pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.299" end="00:32:01.429" style="s2">off more than you put into it gets an</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.070" end="00:32:03.869" style="s2">overflow out of that kind of parity I</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.429" end="00:32:06.169" style="s2">agree because I think all of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.869" end="00:32:10.230" style="s2">things are various ways in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.169" end="00:32:11.909" style="s2">playing with the salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.230" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">and identity forming of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.909" end="00:32:15.029" style="s2">realization because relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:18.769" style="s2">realization is about a dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.029" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2">that ultimately balances between</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.769" end="00:32:24.539" style="s2">opponent processing goals that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:27.179" style="s2">opposite in some sense or a but are also</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.539" end="00:32:29.309" style="s2">interdependent because they interact for</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.179" end="00:32:32.220" style="s2">States and process it&#39;s not just goals</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.309" end="00:32:33.779" style="s2">and so yeah I think I mean it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.220" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">even to embark on any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.779" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">transformation is going to put you into</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:41.730" style="s2">that need to differentiate and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:43.619" style="s2">your your attentional stream because</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.730" end="00:32:45.539" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to you know you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.619" end="00:32:48.210" style="s2">to couple your future self to your</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.539" end="00:32:50.970" style="s2">current self if you&#39;re aspiring and if</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.210" end="00:32:52.619" style="s2">you don&#39;t right and if you&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.970" end="00:32:54.090" style="s2">regulating you have to expand your frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.619" end="00:32:56.669" style="s2">so you can pay attention to the deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.090" end="00:32:59.129" style="s2">future and then zoom in to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.669" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">really deeply happening right now all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.129" end="00:33:05.429" style="s2">these things involve that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:10.739" style="s2">process and I think that&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.429" end="00:33:13.169" style="s2">which we train and it&#39;s a train train</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.739" end="00:33:14.990" style="s2">but like also inhabited we don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.169" end="00:33:18.470" style="s2">have a verb for doing that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.990" end="00:33:21.860" style="s2">but the cognitive flexibility which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.470" end="00:33:24.410" style="s2">so predictive of you know insight being</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.860" end="00:33:26.660" style="s2">able to get into the flow state being</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.410" end="00:33:31.010" style="s2">able to through it you know deal with</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.660" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">complex novel situations yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.010" end="00:33:37.429" style="s2">and I think you know training those</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:38.870" style="s2">training the complexification of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.429" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">attention that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.870" end="00:33:42.380" style="s2">doing we&#39;re differentiating it and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.900" style="s2">reintegrating that&#39;s how we get emergent</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.380" end="00:33:46.730" style="s2">attention attentional capacities I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.900" end="00:33:48.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;m saying this I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.730" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">missing your point I&#39;m trying to say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.170" end="00:33:52.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s almost inevitable because if</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:55.309" style="s2">we want to get new functions we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.550" end="00:33:56.870" style="s2">complexify other functions together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.309" end="00:34:00.800" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.870" end="00:34:02.900" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to self-regulation seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.800" end="00:34:05.630" style="s2">like a really key part of this because</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.900" end="00:34:07.970" style="s2">on one of the areas where this shows up</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.630" end="00:34:10.220" style="s2">is a real concern is in I mean what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.970" end="00:34:12.649" style="s2">call cognitive dissonance when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.220" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">who&#39;s inhabiting a space between two</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.649" end="00:34:18.110" style="s2">different pressures or strategies or</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:20.840" style="s2">perspectives and something in us rejects</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.110" end="00:34:23.600" style="s2">that space we want to fall back onto a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.840" end="00:34:26.300" style="s2">simpler model so in order to stay there</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.600" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">you need not only the idea that you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">to stay there but you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:34.609" style="s2">self-regulate in order to not have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:37.790" style="s2">phobic response to the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.609" end="00:34:40.280" style="s2">if the yeah attentional possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.790" end="00:34:43.129" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna try to integrate I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.280" end="00:34:45.320" style="s2">that&#39;s right um and you know and again I</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.129" end="00:34:49.399" style="s2">think we&#39;ve circled back to an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.320" end="00:34:53.800" style="s2">theme in in a helpful way because part</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.399" end="00:34:57.290" style="s2">of that is to get you know to remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.800" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">to realize because beauty is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.290" end="00:35:03.560" style="s2">that kind of thing I think it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">an experience of something novel</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.560" end="00:35:09.619" style="s2">unfamiliar but it&#39;s it has a potential</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.500" end="00:35:15.140" style="s2">to be drawn into our current world and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.619" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">transform it beauty is a way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.140" end="00:35:21.710" style="s2">can learn to be positively disposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:24.650" style="s2">towards liminal uncertainty as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.710" end="00:35:27.230" style="s2">to the brains natural initial impulse</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.650" end="00:35:28.940" style="s2">which is whew I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.230" end="00:35:31.400" style="s2">really unfamiliar I can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.940" end="00:35:33.490" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen here right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.400" end="00:35:36.650" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting about this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.490" end="00:35:39.020" style="s2">especially you know when this</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.650" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">constellation of things Beauty Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.020" end="00:35:42.859" style="s2">and awe think about oh it&#39;s so all</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:45.050" style="s2">should be one of the worst experiences</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.859" end="00:35:47.630" style="s2">that people have because when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.050" end="00:35:49.069" style="s2">measure what they say is you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.630" end="00:35:51.859" style="s2">get a sense of vastness and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.069" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">incomprehensible &#39;ti and I feel so small</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.859" end="00:35:56.540" style="s2">and powerless well if I just induced</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.560" end="00:36:00.770" style="s2">that in you you&#39;ll usually freak out</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.540" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">right but right and that&#39;s why I can get</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.770" end="00:36:07.369" style="s2">can pass over into horror but ah is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:09.349" style="s2">actually experienced by people as so</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.369" end="00:36:11.390" style="s2">powerfully motivating that it is one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.349" end="00:36:13.099" style="s2">these experiences not perfectly not</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:15.160" style="s2">algorithmically that has a strong</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.099" end="00:36:17.420" style="s2">tendency to motivate people to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.160" end="00:36:19.700" style="s2">longitudinal transformation and change</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.420" end="00:36:21.890" style="s2">so there&#39;s something in us there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.700" end="00:36:23.630" style="s2">potential there&#39;s an aesthetic potential</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.890" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">within us I think this is one of Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.630" end="00:36:28.430" style="s2">insights that we can nurture and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">cultivate we can practice it so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.430" end="00:36:35.089" style="s2">when something comes up right we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">move into that integration that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.089" end="00:36:40.910" style="s2">complexification rather than backing</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.650" end="00:36:43.910" style="s2">away right into the familiar zone of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.910" end="00:36:45.319" style="s2">comfort so again I hope I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.910" end="00:36:47.000" style="s2">repeating myself but I&#39;m trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.319" end="00:36:51.650" style="s2">you what what the connections are I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.000" end="00:36:53.869" style="s2">think yeah I think they&#39;re the flipside</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.650" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">of the same experience you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.869" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">more you learn that component the more</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:01.670" style="s2">your brain is likely to recognize them</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.890" style="s2">when it sees the frustrated version yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.670" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">you&#39;re a half a step away from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.890" end="00:37:08.119" style="s2">exalted version yes it&#39;s private</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:10.970" style="s2">no no coincidence that we use some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.119" end="00:37:13.310" style="s2">the same language for you know religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.970" end="00:37:17.510" style="s2">and even sexual ecstasy that we use for</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.310" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">massive unacceptable thwarting yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.510" end="00:37:24.859" style="s2">yes yeah we reach for the same words</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:27.230" style="s2">well it&#39;s even in related words we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:31.490" style="s2">the word awesome but we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.230" end="00:37:33.240" style="s2">word awful because it has that but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.490" end="00:37:35.790" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.240" end="00:37:38.520" style="s2">I so this is much more speculative on my</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.790" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">part um I think part of why we have an</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.520" end="00:37:44.910" style="s2">aesthetic for this is places where</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:47.160" style="s2">things that are that we have a de cotta</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.910" end="00:37:48.750" style="s2">me between but and we realize that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.160" end="00:37:51.090" style="s2">actually they&#39;re interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.750" end="00:37:53.160" style="s2">opponent right these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.090" end="00:37:56.010" style="s2">places of Kairos these are places of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">criticality where these are actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.010" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">opportunities for significant</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:05.670" style="s2">developmental change and so again I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:07.850" style="s2">think we we have so I think we have two</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.670" end="00:38:09.510" style="s2">choices about that we can be passive and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.850" end="00:38:11.790" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.510" end="00:38:13.500" style="s2">well maybe three choices let me try we</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.790" end="00:38:16.950" style="s2">can be passive and just say well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.500" end="00:38:18.930" style="s2">just gonna wait for those events but</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.950" end="00:38:20.610" style="s2">then when they happen you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.930" end="00:38:22.650" style="s2">not going to be able to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.610" end="00:38:24.360" style="s2">properly assume so many traditions say</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.650" end="00:38:26.730" style="s2">practice on little things where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.360" end="00:38:28.890" style="s2">nothing major happening so when the big</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.730" end="00:38:30.390" style="s2">thing happens you&#39;re ready to go because</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.890" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">if you try and cultivate it when the big</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.390" end="00:38:35.850" style="s2">things happen you&#39;re pretty much gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.740" style="s2">get screwed right now the flip side is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.850" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">also mistake well I&#39;m gonna make I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.740" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">gonna secure Lea Activision I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">make Beauty appear before that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:49.740" style="s2">gonna work either so this is why again</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing so much work on this</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.740" end="00:38:54.119" style="s2">notion of participatory knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:56.700" style="s2">because one one of the functions</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.119" end="00:38:57.960" style="s2">I think of participatory knowing that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.700" end="00:38:59.970" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked that much about but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.960" end="00:39:02.820" style="s2">it&#39;s in my thinking and I want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.970" end="00:39:05.060" style="s2">it up is how it precisely steers us</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.820" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">between the skillet and Charybdis of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.060" end="00:39:09.450" style="s2">passivity pure passivity and pure</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:11.910" style="s2">activity and it gets well it gives me</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:14.220" style="s2">participation and and this was really</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.910" end="00:39:15.990" style="s2">emphasized emphasized in all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.220" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">traditions and it&#39;s enough something</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.990" end="00:39:20.040" style="s2">that lends book right trying not to try</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.820" end="00:39:22.380" style="s2">right where you&#39;re trying to find and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.040" end="00:39:27.420" style="s2">right effort right and all this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.380" end="00:39:33.510" style="s2">stuff and so I think you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.420" end="00:39:36.359" style="s2">cultivate a deep capacity for recognized</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.510" end="00:39:39.000" style="s2">and even beautified participatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.359" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">knowing so that you come into those</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.000" end="00:39:45.029" style="s2">Kairos with the set of skills you need</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:51.709" style="s2">but also the proper existential mode for</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.029" end="00:39:55.319" style="s2">or relating to them do you think these</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.709" end="00:39:57.630" style="s2">disruptions are I don&#39;t want how to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.319" end="00:40:00.089" style="s2">this all of equal size right when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.630" end="00:40:01.229" style="s2">say awesome and awful one sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.089" end="00:40:03.150" style="s2">it&#39;s full of all and the other one</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.229" end="00:40:06.479" style="s2">sounds like it has some aw in it which</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.150" end="00:40:09.689" style="s2">might be the amount as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.479" end="00:40:11.549" style="s2">complete overload so are these are these</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.689" end="00:40:14.069" style="s2">situations where there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.549" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">absolute overwhelm in which you could go</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.069" end="00:40:18.299" style="s2">either way with it or is it more like</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:20.069" style="s2">there&#39;s too much of it sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.299" end="00:40:21.779" style="s2">other times it feels like almost too</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.069" end="00:40:24.390" style="s2">much but really it&#39;s a manageable amount</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.779" end="00:40:26.189" style="s2">or it&#39;s at the edge of your assimilation</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.390" end="00:40:28.349" style="s2">capacity yeah and I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.189" end="00:40:31.439" style="s2">Marilla was trying to get at in the in</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.349" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">the dunya ology is right it&#39;s it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.439" end="00:40:38.939" style="s2">the and Fischer talks about that in his</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:40.919" style="s2">book wonder the rainbow and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.939" end="00:40:43.289" style="s2">aesthetics of rare experience where he</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.919" end="00:40:44.519" style="s2">says what they do is they put you on</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.289" end="00:40:46.769" style="s2">what he calls the horizon of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.519" end="00:40:49.799" style="s2">intelligibility they put you into that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.769" end="00:40:51.779" style="s2">place and is this you know I call it the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.799" end="00:40:53.939" style="s2">trans world it&#39;s not like an other world</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.779" end="00:40:56.729" style="s2">it&#39;s a place between two different you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.939" end="00:40:57.869" style="s2">know existential worlds right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.729" end="00:40:59.400" style="s2">in you&#39;re there you&#39;re right on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.869" end="00:41:01.199" style="s2">horizon and intelligibility you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.400" end="00:41:03.329" style="s2">still you can still feel backwards to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.199" end="00:41:05.309" style="s2">where you are currently but you also</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.329" end="00:41:07.169" style="s2">have a port ending and a portal right</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.309" end="00:41:13.019" style="s2">those words are related for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.169" end="00:41:15.380" style="s2">right and so I think I think that it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.019" end="00:41:19.319" style="s2">think it&#39;s more like beauty it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.380" end="00:41:20.969" style="s2">something where we have a saw and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.319" end="00:41:23.489" style="s2">know I&#39;m working with Jennifer stellar</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.969" end="00:41:27.059" style="s2">and Michele Ferrari and Jensen Kinlan is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.489" end="00:41:31.589" style="s2">but ah seems to me to be an indication</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.059" end="00:41:33.569" style="s2">of that you&#39;ve got not an optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.589" end="00:41:38.729" style="s2">on the phenomena because that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.569" end="00:41:40.469" style="s2">but that there is speculation on my part</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.729" end="00:41:42.689" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.469" end="00:41:44.999" style="s2">cognitive mechanisms that it that sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.689" end="00:41:46.709" style="s2">of tracks and says your complexify in</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.999" end="00:41:49.199" style="s2">the face of this and it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.709" end="00:41:52.229" style="s2">clear the signal keep going versus ah</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.199" end="00:41:54.599" style="s2">right no it&#39;s not complexified it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.229" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">gelling signal is not clearing and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.599" end="00:41:59.099" style="s2">think that&#39;s when you start to move in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">horror I think part of what influence</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.099" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">that is not only our optimal grip on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.819" style="s2">world but our our optimal grip on our</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.380" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">seeing of the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.819" end="00:42:09.959" style="s2">this is prospect and refuge theory right</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:14.279" style="s2">the the womb with the view is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.959" end="00:42:16.979" style="s2">sometimes called so we are there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.279" end="00:42:21.239" style="s2">certain aesthetics of participating in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.979" end="00:42:23.430" style="s2">an environment that are important we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.239" end="00:42:25.769" style="s2">want to see as much as we can while</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.430" end="00:42:28.890" style="s2">being seen as little as we can because</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.769" end="00:42:30.359" style="s2">the first will help us find prey and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.890" end="00:42:35.309" style="s2">right and the second one will help us</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.359" end="00:42:36.989" style="s2">avoid predation right and so again you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.309" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">have to you have to you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.989" end="00:42:45.959" style="s2">there has to be or not only an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:48.539" style="s2">grip on whatever the our field thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.959" end="00:42:50.339" style="s2">there has to be or a sense that your</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.539" end="00:42:52.440" style="s2">complexify towards an optimal grip I</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.339" end="00:42:55.019" style="s2">think you have to have a current optimal</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.440" end="00:42:57.690" style="s2">grip of like how you&#39;re seeing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.019" end="00:43:00.719" style="s2">saying like so for example a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.690" end="00:43:03.900" style="s2">example you&#39;re much more likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.719" end="00:43:05.910" style="s2">ah as opposed to horror witnessing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.900" end="00:43:08.309" style="s2">stupendous lightning storm if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.910" end="00:43:12.150" style="s2">standing on your balcony but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.309" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">out in the open field that&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.150" end="00:43:19.499" style="s2">oh no right because you&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:21.420" style="s2">exposed deeply vulnerable so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.499" end="00:43:23.999" style="s2">think there&#39;s a really there&#39;s a finesse</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.420" end="00:43:26.999" style="s2">to toggling between getting an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.999" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">drift on whatever the thing is it right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.999" end="00:43:33.739" style="s2">and also that is being that this optimal</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:37.709" style="s2">grip and the optimal grip on sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.739" end="00:43:39.959" style="s2">placement in the environment if you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.709" end="00:43:41.819" style="s2">those two together in there in sync I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.959" end="00:43:45.719" style="s2">think that&#39;s what takes you more towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.819" end="00:43:47.699" style="s2">ah right if you if you if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.719" end="00:43:49.109" style="s2">back of an optimal grip but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.699" end="00:43:54.539" style="s2">nothing in that much amazing happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.109" end="00:43:56.459" style="s2">here you probably feel mild anxiety so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.539" end="00:43:59.039" style="s2">did that did that answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.459" end="00:44:00.949" style="s2">yeah I think so if I even remember what</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.039" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">the question was what is their question</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.949" end="00:44:08.519" style="s2">the question was well you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:10.440" style="s2">thought was in terms of seeing as much</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.519" end="00:44:11.099" style="s2">as you can while being seen as little as</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.440" end="00:44:12.440" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.099" end="00:44:16.310" style="s2">yeah right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.440" end="00:44:18.770" style="s2">like being an audience member Inc of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.310" end="00:44:21.020" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.770" end="00:44:23.089" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s first book about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.020" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">Dionysian festivals and the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.089" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">tragedy and his critique of Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">notion of tragedy because you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.750" style="s2">telling a story there of these ancient</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">people gathering as the audience around</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.750" end="00:44:37.400" style="s2">this young religious festival that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:40.730" style="s2">might call an entertainment festival</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.400" end="00:44:43.490" style="s2">today yeah and his critique of Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.730" end="00:44:45.700" style="s2">is that he says Aristotle is too focused</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.490" end="00:44:48.380" style="s2">on the pathos that people were having</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.700" end="00:44:49.730" style="s2">going through these bad experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.380" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">Nietzsche says no if you were in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.730" end="00:44:53.960" style="s2">right state if you were robust if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:56.450" style="s2">had the right philosophy if you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.960" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">hearty then you&#39;re not experiencing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.450" end="00:45:02.030" style="s2">death of the hero as a tragedy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">having fun watching a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.030" end="00:45:06.920" style="s2">entertainment you&#39;re reveling in what</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:09.140" style="s2">appears to be a tragedy assuming you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.920" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">coming from the right embedding to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.140" end="00:45:16.190" style="s2">handle that right I agree with that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:19.310" style="s2">Nietzsche also I mean part of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.190" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">main themes of the birth of tragedy from</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.310" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">this period of music is that the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:29.869" style="s2">is a particularly powerful object right</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:31.250" style="s2">you know not just in the cognitive sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.869" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">not I don&#39;t mean I could think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.250" end="00:45:37.210" style="s2">tragedy come right it you could what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:39.770" style="s2">have is you have the Apollonian hero</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.210" end="00:45:43.400" style="s2">right and but you have the Dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.770" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2">chorus and he you know and his</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.400" end="00:45:47.450" style="s2">philosophy as you know it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:49.450" style="s2">and here we&#39;re back to idiot it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.450" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">about finding a dynamic optimization</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.450" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">between the Apollonian and the Dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">these critique of Socrates which i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:46:00.109" style="s2">is misplaced by the way is that socrates</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:03.890" style="s2">overemphasize the Apollonian at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.109" end="00:46:07.790" style="s2">expense of the Dionysian um so III do</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.890" end="00:46:08.210" style="s2">think that you there both of what I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.790" end="00:46:11.990" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.210" end="00:46:14.329" style="s2">are there so part of what the prospect</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.990" end="00:46:16.910" style="s2">and refuge thing does is it interacts</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.329" end="00:46:19.910" style="s2">with right two senses of realness that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.910" end="00:46:21.619" style="s2">we have the Apollonian a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.910" end="00:46:23.540" style="s2">realness is things are real when they</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.619" end="00:46:25.039" style="s2">are confirmed when they&#39;re firmed</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.540" end="00:46:28.069" style="s2">together where there</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.039" end="00:46:31.130" style="s2">coherent right and the dynein is know</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.069" end="00:46:33.289" style="s2">things are most rap most real to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.130" end="00:46:35.209" style="s2">when they catch you by surprise</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.289" end="00:46:37.309" style="s2">and and by the way people do do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.209" end="00:46:39.259" style="s2">they do use those two different</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.309" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">different standards of realness in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.259" end="00:46:43.429" style="s2">practical sense they you know what makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:45.019" style="s2">sense and they can confirm that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.429" end="00:46:48.559" style="s2">most real and then that which catches</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.019" end="00:46:51.289" style="s2">them Supremes you know by deep surprise</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.559" end="00:46:53.419" style="s2">is actually what&#39;s real and and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.289" end="00:46:56.299" style="s2">reason is even though that&#39;s there they</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.419" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">are not logically identical they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.299" end="00:47:01.369" style="s2">again stereoscopic you need both of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.049" style="s2">for getting closer to realness if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.369" end="00:47:04.579" style="s2">if you if you don&#39;t ever have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.049" end="00:47:05.929" style="s2">coherence in the confirmation then</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.579" end="00:47:09.349" style="s2">you&#39;re not picking up on any patterns</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.929" end="00:47:11.059" style="s2">you&#39;re just right but right if you never</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.349" end="00:47:13.969" style="s2">are if those patterns are never broken</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.059" end="00:47:18.469" style="s2">by the Dionysian then you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.969" end="00:47:21.559" style="s2">ossified and locked in and so again III</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.469" end="00:47:24.259" style="s2">think that right the prospect and refuge</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.559" end="00:47:27.559" style="s2">yeah that you you want you do want to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.259" end="00:47:29.900" style="s2">able to have the right relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.559" end="00:47:30.199" style="s2">the unfolding and and art I see your</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.900" end="00:47:32.119" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.199" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">art is a very powerful way of giving us</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.119" end="00:47:36.229" style="s2">prospect and refuge on something</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:39.349" style="s2">beautiful I agree with that I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.229" end="00:47:41.689" style="s2">that&#39;s a profound point but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.349" end="00:47:43.699" style="s2">emphasize that even within tragedy you</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.689" end="00:47:45.709" style="s2">see this theme we&#39;re talking about about</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.699" end="00:47:47.689" style="s2">try and and what&#39;s really interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.709" end="00:47:49.579" style="s2">think and this wasn&#39;t explored enough um</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.689" end="00:47:51.259" style="s2">I think well maybe has I haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.579" end="00:47:54.049" style="s2">all the scholarship on the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.259" end="00:47:55.549" style="s2">tragedy but Nietzsche was really and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.049" end="00:47:57.499" style="s2">this is what I think it was this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.549" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">theme you can see some of his team&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.499" end="00:48:01.849" style="s2">drift away and drop away but this theme</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:04.159" style="s2">of the integration the complexification</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.849" end="00:48:07.699" style="s2">of the Apollonian and Dionysian runs</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.159" end="00:48:09.619" style="s2">through him completely and that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.699" end="00:48:13.099" style="s2">horizon of intelligibility that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.619" end="00:48:15.829" style="s2">place between the Apollonian confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.099" end="00:48:19.669" style="s2">you know where you cook you know safety</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.829" end="00:48:26.059" style="s2">and the Dionysian prospect of challenge</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.669" end="00:48:28.189" style="s2">and change yeah he&#39;s it&#39;s a very yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.059" end="00:48:29.779" style="s2">definitely not my favorite of his books</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.189" end="00:48:31.699" style="s2">but there&#39;s something in there that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.779" end="00:48:33.559" style="s2">that&#39;s at the core of his thought and is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.699" end="00:48:36.019" style="s2">particularly relevant I think still</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.559" end="00:48:38.540" style="s2">going forward I agree with you is his</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.019" end="00:48:41.350" style="s2">critique of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.540" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">he&#39;s using Socrates to exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.350" end="00:48:45.340" style="s2">something that happened historically and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:47.780" style="s2">I think he&#39;s picking on Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.340" end="00:48:50.840" style="s2">unfairly because he&#39;s trying to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.780" end="00:48:54.080" style="s2">his own initial love of Socrates so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.840" end="00:48:58.130" style="s2">struggling I think he&#39;s quite right to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.080" end="00:49:02.360" style="s2">call for a musical Socrates yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.130" end="00:49:04.130" style="s2">I think that in that that idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:06.950" style="s2">interplay of the dynasty and in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.130" end="00:49:09.320" style="s2">Apollonian and the idea that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.950" end="00:49:11.870" style="s2">brought forward to us in art and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.320" end="00:49:17.170" style="s2">entertainment so that we can see this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.870" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2">process unfold and even see the central</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.170" end="00:49:22.040" style="s2">representative of our coherent meaning</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.430" end="00:49:25.160" style="s2">making be taken to pieces and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.040" end="00:49:26.450" style="s2">somehow come back together and and live</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.160" end="00:49:28.940" style="s2">to fight another day</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.450" end="00:49:31.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a huge thing culturally</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.940" end="00:49:33.710" style="s2">for us to learn this process right in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.790" end="00:49:35.210" style="s2">religious groups or philosophical groups</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.710" end="00:49:37.940" style="s2">you could communicate very openly about</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.210" end="00:49:40.940" style="s2">it yeah but in general people would need</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.940" end="00:49:42.770" style="s2">to see the pattern happen many times to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.940" end="00:49:44.840" style="s2">start to assimilate it I would guess I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.770" end="00:49:47.480" style="s2">think this is very interesting what</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.840" end="00:49:50.150" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.480" end="00:49:54.380" style="s2">aesthetics because it leads me to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.150" end="00:49:57.740" style="s2">know this idea that you know that might</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.380" end="00:49:59.450" style="s2">be a way again not exclusive or</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.740" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">exhaustive but an interesting way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.450" end="00:50:04.940" style="s2">trying to distinguish art from</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.010" style="s2">entertainment well maybe entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.940" end="00:50:08.270" style="s2">is the aesthetics of the smooth and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.010" end="00:50:11.690" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.270" end="00:50:13.700" style="s2">right but maybe art is the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.690" end="00:50:16.580" style="s2">wonder in the way we&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.700" end="00:50:18.440" style="s2">here like you know suck you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.580" end="00:50:22.010" style="s2">symposium Socrates talks about how what</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.440" end="00:50:24.980" style="s2">he&#39;s Metaxa and also how love is attacks</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.010" end="00:50:26.780" style="s2">ooh arrows because right if we could</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.980" end="00:50:29.660" style="s2">because we try to get again on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.780" end="00:50:31.190" style="s2">horizon of intelligibility right when we</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.660" end="00:50:32.870" style="s2">when we love something beautiful we love</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.190" end="00:50:35.480" style="s2">it precisely because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.870" end="00:50:38.180" style="s2">completely conformable to it right well</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.480" end="00:50:40.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack that you know when we see</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.180" end="00:50:45.380" style="s2">something beautiful in a way it awakens</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.520" end="00:50:48.080" style="s2">a sense of lack in us right arm and but</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.380" end="00:50:50.370" style="s2">also right but but there&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.080" end="00:50:53.310" style="s2">it impels us forward</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.370" end="00:50:58.380" style="s2">it gives us some sense it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.310" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">interesting I have in my in my with my</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.380" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">signature thing the script under my</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">signature and in Gmail you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">love is its own kind of its own way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:10.380" style="s2">knowing and where the and it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:12.810" style="s2">noticing kind of knowing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.380" end="00:51:15.120" style="s2">really interesting how love gives you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.810" end="00:51:18.270" style="s2">simultaneously the sense of something</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.120" end="00:51:20.790" style="s2">you lack which is you know the prospect</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.270" end="00:51:23.850" style="s2">but it also gives you some intuition</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.790" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s it is achievable for you or</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.850" end="00:51:30.600" style="s2">knowable to you you can enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:33.390" style="s2">proper relationship to it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.600" end="00:51:35.910" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly a place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.390" end="00:51:37.740" style="s2">gonna find real deep integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.910" end="00:51:40.110" style="s2">sakra of the Apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.740" end="00:51:43.290" style="s2">and the Dionysian and Socrates is all</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.110" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">about that kind of love he deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.290" end="00:51:47.400" style="s2">is and that&#39;s what I thought so I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:49.410" style="s2">Nietzsche deeply misses I think we write</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.400" end="00:51:52.110" style="s2">because Nietzsche famously says I hate</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.410" end="00:51:56.250" style="s2">Socrates he&#39;s so close to me I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.110" end="00:51:59.010" style="s2">fighting him and so uh but I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.250" end="00:52:01.670" style="s2">giving my I think a you know a specific</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.010" end="00:52:06.090" style="s2">argument to your point that I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.670" end="00:52:08.280" style="s2">Socrates emphasis on an agogic love</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.090" end="00:52:10.770" style="s2">right the transfer more transformation</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.280" end="00:52:14.430" style="s2">of eros into an agog a the ascent right</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.770" end="00:52:16.830" style="s2">is clearly where his love is a place</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.430" end="00:52:20.130" style="s2">where we most deeply fuse the Apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.830" end="00:52:21.780" style="s2">and the Dionysian and love is the proper</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.130" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">love and reverence are the proper</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.780" end="00:52:28.560" style="s2">response to beauty let me throw in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:31.170" style="s2">segue anecdote here it&#39;s a segue or our</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.560" end="00:52:33.720" style="s2">continuation I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.170" end="00:52:36.420" style="s2">of a time that I went to an art exhibit</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.720" end="00:52:40.280" style="s2">with my father in Vancouver and upstairs</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.420" end="00:52:43.470" style="s2">was a bunch of conceptual art pieces</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.280" end="00:52:45.720" style="s2">mostly by Young University art students</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.470" end="00:52:48.300" style="s2">right and not that that can&#39;t be an</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.720" end="00:52:50.430" style="s2">amazing thing but it sort of leaves you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.300" end="00:52:52.380" style="s2">each one you look at and go is this art</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.430" end="00:52:54.870" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what art is what is art is</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.380" end="00:52:58.530" style="s2">the question it&#39;s time and downstairs</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.870" end="00:53:01.080" style="s2">was the Rodin exhibit yeah and when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.530" end="00:53:02.970" style="s2">see a piece of Rodin or in a room full</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.080" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">of them you don&#39;t think what is art you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.970" end="00:53:06.660" style="s2">think oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:11.579" style="s2">what the hell is this what was this guy</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.660" end="00:53:14.549" style="s2">trying to do there&#39;s astonishing quality</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.579" end="00:53:17.400" style="s2">to it a real surprise in disruption and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.549" end="00:53:20.670" style="s2">a demand right it demands something from</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.400" end="00:53:21.900" style="s2">you like because I was murder Fox load</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.670" end="00:53:24.989" style="s2">that and the sovereignty of the good it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.900" end="00:53:27.239" style="s2">demands your attention not not you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.989" end="00:53:29.369" style="s2">in some sort of animistic sense but it</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.239" end="00:53:32.190" style="s2">demands your attention in that part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.369" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">the realization is the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.190" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">it is do a particular kind of effort and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:42.749" style="s2">do a particular kind of attention and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:45.299" style="s2">and that again I think it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.749" end="00:53:46.200" style="s2">that generative sense of beauty that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.299" end="00:53:50.729" style="s2">talking about rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.200" end="00:53:52.529" style="s2">consumptives very much where I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.729" end="00:53:56.069" style="s2">go with that because I&#39;m thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.529" end="00:53:58.440" style="s2">in terms of time frames ah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.069" end="00:54:00.839" style="s2">form of art where you go oh yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.440" end="00:54:02.729" style="s2">that&#39;s neat and and everyday you see it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.839" end="00:54:04.380" style="s2">after that you&#39;re less impressed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.729" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s this other form where</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.380" end="00:54:09.180" style="s2">initially all you&#39;re confronted with is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.660" end="00:54:11.219" style="s2">the demands and every time you see it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.180" end="00:54:13.410" style="s2">you&#39;re more and more impressed you see</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.219" end="00:54:16.920" style="s2">more and more about it there&#39;s a as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.410" end="00:54:18.150" style="s2">analogy there with addictive flow States</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.920" end="00:54:19.819" style="s2">which I know is something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.150" end="00:54:23.160" style="s2">concerned with because there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.819" end="00:54:25.979" style="s2">initial feedback that yeah upfront and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.160" end="00:54:27.989" style="s2">it starts to trail off yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.979" end="00:54:33.049" style="s2">this other kind where there&#39;s an initial</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.989" end="00:54:37.140" style="s2">demand and it builds up yes I think so</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.049" end="00:54:40.049" style="s2">so if you take a look like scurries</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.140" end="00:54:42.299" style="s2">notion of beauty she talks about how it</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.049" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">trains us for truth and justice the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.299" end="00:54:45.660" style="s2">experience of beauty it actually trains</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:49.259" style="s2">us and that&#39;s what exactly we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.660" end="00:54:50.279" style="s2">about here right and she so she does</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.259" end="00:54:52.380" style="s2">this thing where she says you come upon</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.279" end="00:54:57.630" style="s2">a tree and it&#39;s really beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.380" end="00:55:00.390" style="s2">then so so part of it is a kind of mmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.630" end="00:55:02.039" style="s2">what I want I can call mortis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.390" end="00:55:04.440" style="s2">more two trees that I have previously</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.039" end="00:55:06.930" style="s2">realized right so there&#39;s this aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.440" end="00:55:09.420" style="s2">it that&#39;s very jet that encompasses all</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.930" end="00:55:11.489" style="s2">trees and you&#39;ve now seen something</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.420" end="00:55:14.579" style="s2">about all trees there&#39;s a mourneth but</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.489" end="00:55:16.170" style="s2">then she said I&#39;m using my language not</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.579" end="00:55:17.390" style="s2">hers but she points out but then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.170" end="00:55:19.610" style="s2">also struck by the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.390" end="00:55:22.310" style="s2">hilarity of it what the Buddhists would</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.610" end="00:55:25.610" style="s2">call the suchness of it that that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.310" end="00:55:28.010" style="s2">way it&#39;s presented to us as it has a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.610" end="00:55:31.670" style="s2">kind of uniqueness and irreplaceable &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.010" end="00:55:33.800" style="s2">and unrepeatable &#39;ti about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.670" end="00:55:36.140" style="s2">again I think I think beauty is playing</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.800" end="00:55:39.020" style="s2">between those two things it&#39;s giving us</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.140" end="00:55:42.530" style="s2">two senses of how things can be beyond</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.020" end="00:55:44.600" style="s2">our categorical scheme one way it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.530" end="00:55:47.420" style="s2">put us into sort of combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.600" end="00:55:51.650" style="s2">explosion right oh wow Wow</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.420" end="00:55:54.770" style="s2">so much more right but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.650" end="00:55:57.530" style="s2">there&#39;s also you know the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.770" end="00:56:00.050" style="s2">non categorical identity of everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.530" end="00:56:03.290" style="s2">that beyond all of the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.050" end="00:56:05.810" style="s2">it&#39;s belongs to categories this is its</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.290" end="00:56:09.320" style="s2">own particular well it&#39;s the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.810" end="00:56:11.840" style="s2">States it&#39;s such an astute on it is to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.320" end="00:56:13.670" style="s2">put it into a category you have that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.840" end="00:56:17.600" style="s2">know you have those those moments I</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.670" end="00:56:19.790" style="s2">think in art - um well you really you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.600" end="00:56:23.120" style="s2">see something right I didn&#39;t realise a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.790" end="00:56:26.810" style="s2">tree could be like that right and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.120" end="00:56:30.080" style="s2">also right you realize there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.810" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something non-repeatable in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.080" end="00:56:33.560" style="s2">moment that I shouldn&#39;t be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:34.900" style="s2">repeat because if I try to repeat it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.560" end="00:56:40.670" style="s2">gonna lose it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.900" end="00:56:43.220" style="s2">so I think what happens right is when</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.670" end="00:56:46.370" style="s2">the way it gets repeated is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.220" end="00:56:48.130" style="s2">repetition it&#39;s like instead what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.370" end="00:56:50.420" style="s2">talked about before with sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.130" end="00:56:51.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the and I think this is what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.420" end="00:56:54.320" style="s2">mean like here suppose it&#39;s a work of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.890" end="00:56:56.680" style="s2">art you you you what you do is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.320" end="00:56:59.420" style="s2">transforms you you go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.680" end="00:57:00.680" style="s2">right and then when you come back you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.420" end="00:57:02.780" style="s2">see something in it you hadn&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.680" end="00:57:05.930" style="s2">before again you&#39;re not repeating the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.780" end="00:57:07.640" style="s2">experience what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.930" end="00:57:09.890" style="s2">repeating the trend the process of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.640" end="00:57:11.870" style="s2">transformation and I think we shift off</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.890" end="00:57:14.270" style="s2">back to the beginning again trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.870" end="00:57:17.270" style="s2">repeat the experience rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.270" end="00:57:20.120" style="s2">to cycle the transformation I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.270" end="00:57:21.950" style="s2">that&#39;s again that&#39;s what we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.120" end="00:57:23.690" style="s2">doing and that really ties in again to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.950" end="00:57:26.600" style="s2">this other sense of beauty that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.690" end="00:57:29.339" style="s2">trying to talk about and love yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.600" end="00:57:31.289" style="s2">addiction definitely has this</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.339" end="00:57:33.420" style="s2">diminishing returns problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.289" end="00:57:36.359" style="s2">attempt to repeat the initial experience</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.420" end="00:57:37.979" style="s2">as as validly beautiful as that initial</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.359" end="00:57:40.349" style="s2">experience might have been for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.979" end="00:57:44.460" style="s2">person right it&#39;s interesting with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.349" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">tree you know the the notion of the I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.460" end="00:57:51.719" style="s2">thou relationship yeah because I like I</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:53.489" style="s2">never knew that about a tree before I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.719" end="00:57:56.369" style="s2">got the first and third person in there</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.489" end="00:57:58.650" style="s2">but in perceiving and this to me goes</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.369" end="00:58:00.930" style="s2">back to what I was talking about about</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.650" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">the assimilation of perceptions this</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.930" end="00:58:08.249" style="s2">tree strikes me and I&#39;m partly looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:09.900" style="s2">at it&#39;s the unique intactness of its</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.249" end="00:58:12.539" style="s2">wholeness at the moment which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.900" end="00:58:14.789" style="s2">something I&#39;m cognitively sculpting out</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.539" end="00:58:16.650" style="s2">of reality to some degree right but</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.789" end="00:58:18.869" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s like a next note right</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.650" end="00:58:22.499" style="s2">if that&#39;s doe Rea then maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.869" end="00:58:24.539" style="s2">me there&#39;s this next stage where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.499" end="00:58:27.059" style="s2">like the tree begins to lurk where it</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.539" end="00:58:29.579" style="s2">has this withdrawn quality this other</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.059" end="00:58:31.499" style="s2">Nassif I&#39;m in dialogue with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.579" end="00:58:34.589" style="s2">yes right we&#39;re not necessarily speaking</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.499" end="00:58:37.410" style="s2">but me and the tree are kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.589" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">balanced in my experience totally gauche</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.410" end="00:58:42.299" style="s2">meeting now but that&#39;s the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">gnosis right the heart of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.299" end="00:58:48.329" style="s2">knowing that you know you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:51.809" style="s2">you know the tree by becoming sort of at</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.329" end="00:58:54.269" style="s2">one with the tree you right you you sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.809" end="00:58:56.190" style="s2">of you&#39;re sort of personifying the tree</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.269" end="00:58:59.549" style="s2">but also tree of finding yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.190" end="00:59:01.859" style="s2">this resonant cycle so that more of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.549" end="00:59:03.690" style="s2">tree is being disclosed to you and more</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.859" end="00:59:06.539" style="s2">of you is being disclosed to you but</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.690" end="00:59:09.539" style="s2">again not categorically but it but you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.539" end="00:59:10.950" style="s2">know I want to say expressively in but</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.539" end="00:59:13.710" style="s2">in collingwood sense what people will</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.950" end="00:59:14.849" style="s2">hear romanticism but it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.710" end="00:59:16.680" style="s2">expressed to you as you said in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.849" end="00:59:19.259" style="s2">being mode it&#39;s doing the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.680" end="00:59:21.569" style="s2">opening very much very much and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.259" end="00:59:22.710" style="s2">notion the notion that comes out is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.569" end="00:59:26.039" style="s2">notion I&#39;ve been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.710" end="00:59:29.279" style="s2">recently is right trying to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.039" end="00:59:31.859" style="s2">the notion of faith not as the assertion</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.279" end="00:59:33.690" style="s2">of belief but as the coupling of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.859" end="00:59:35.819" style="s2">emergence of mind to the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.690" end="00:59:39.539" style="s2">the world that puts us into ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.819" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">right relationship with reality so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.539" end="00:59:45.900" style="s2">model I have here is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:47.790" style="s2">my faithfulness to my partner is not to</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.900" end="00:59:49.500" style="s2">hole is it&#39;s precisely not to hold an</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.790" end="00:59:53.010" style="s2">unchangeable set of beliefs about her or</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.500" end="00:59:55.950" style="s2">to try and completely grasper or have it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.010" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2">fixed it&#39;s instead to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.950" end="01:00:02.010" style="s2">resonant adaptivity with her so that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.950" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2">she changes I can afford that and I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.010" end="01:00:06.600" style="s2">adaptively change with her it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:09.090" style="s2">continuity of contact it&#39;s a it&#39;s a co</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.600" end="01:00:10.230" style="s2">emergence there right a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.090" end="01:00:12.960" style="s2">faithfulness rather than an</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.230" end="01:00:15.180" style="s2">assertiveness and I think when people</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.960" end="01:00:17.910" style="s2">have this you know where Beauty</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.180" end="01:00:20.010" style="s2">motivates them in love to be faithful to</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.910" end="01:00:22.440" style="s2">something like a text or a work of art</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.010" end="01:00:27.780" style="s2">mmm I think we&#39;re getting into the realm</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.440" end="01:00:31.800" style="s2">of the sacred now I really do I agree</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.780" end="01:00:38.220" style="s2">with all that I think you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.800" end="01:00:40.290" style="s2">resonance that&#39;s implied by fidelity but</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.220" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">here&#39;s something I think about a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.290" end="01:00:46.170" style="s2">which is one of the basic shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:49.410" style="s2">skills I would say is proprioceptive</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:50.820" style="s2">imagination oh they&#39;re not yes I thought</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.410" end="01:00:53.970" style="s2">that immediately when you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.820" end="01:00:56.490" style="s2">about you know the tree becoming you yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.970" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">yeah because if you try to imagine what</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.490" end="01:01:02.340" style="s2">it feels like to be the tree or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:05.540" style="s2">Jaguar or whatever you have a real it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.340" end="01:01:08.340" style="s2">seems to me you have an edge in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.540" end="01:01:10.200" style="s2">the skills necessary to undergo these</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.340" end="01:01:12.420" style="s2">experiences we&#39;re talking about and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.200" end="01:01:16.260" style="s2">that the whatever allows people to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.420" end="01:01:18.780" style="s2">more capable in terms of interception at</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.260" end="01:01:20.340" style="s2">proprioception probably sets them up to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.780" end="01:01:25.160" style="s2">be able to have more of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.340" end="01:01:27.540" style="s2">experiences I agree I mean so you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.160" end="01:01:29.790" style="s2">shamans I mean this is why there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.540" end="01:01:30.780" style="s2">long tradition of shape-shifting with</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.790" end="01:01:32.670" style="s2">shamans right</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.780" end="01:01:36.120" style="s2">precisely because and I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.670" end="01:01:37.620" style="s2">this in the series so not only at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.120" end="01:01:39.840" style="s2">spiritual value of being able to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.620" end="01:01:42.090" style="s2">into this gnosis with things this has</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.840" end="01:01:44.010" style="s2">practical value the shaman who is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.090" end="01:01:45.510" style="s2">shaman you have to remember it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.010" end="01:01:46.770" style="s2">you&#39;re taking your glasses off and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.510" end="01:01:48.330" style="s2">looking at them and then you put them</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.770" end="01:01:50.580" style="s2">back on and see if you look different so</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.330" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">the shaman has a participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.580" end="01:01:54.309" style="s2">in act serious play what it is to be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.280" end="01:01:56.680" style="s2">dear</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.309" end="01:01:59.859" style="s2">and that will often help him be really</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.680" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">good at tracking the deer and so you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.859" end="01:02:04.449" style="s2">this corrective loop and if he tracks</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:06.489" style="s2">the deer better right it&#39;s Anna guarding</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.449" end="01:02:08.709" style="s2">that feeds back into well that worked</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.489" end="01:02:11.499" style="s2">and you know and so the and then you get</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.709" end="01:02:14.589" style="s2">to cycling so you know shamans seem like</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.499" end="01:02:16.180" style="s2">almost have you know miraculous tracking</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.589" end="01:02:18.309" style="s2">abilities because they can really get</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.180" end="01:02:21.789" style="s2">into the head of the animals that their</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.309" end="01:02:23.469" style="s2">right um that their well doing this kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.789" end="01:02:26.939" style="s2">of participatory knowing with so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.469" end="01:02:30.789" style="s2">participatory knowing yes has tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.939" end="01:02:32.650" style="s2">spiritual potential but I think we</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.789" end="01:02:34.329" style="s2">particularly cultivated it because it</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.650" end="01:02:36.489" style="s2">was both socially that&#39;s doing this with</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.329" end="01:02:38.349" style="s2">other people by the identifying with</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.489" end="01:02:40.599" style="s2">other people is really important and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.349" end="01:02:42.519" style="s2">think it was also really adaptive when</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.599" end="01:02:45.430" style="s2">we were hunter-gatherers it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.519" end="01:02:46.779" style="s2">powerfully adaptive for us um so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.430" end="01:02:49.660" style="s2">that&#39;s why we carry around this</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.779" end="01:02:53.859" style="s2">machinery and we try to exact it into so</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.660" end="01:02:56.079" style="s2">many different situations I I wonder how</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.859" end="01:03:00.660" style="s2">far back it goes you know because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.079" end="01:03:03.339" style="s2">not difficult to imagine that at some</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.660" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">extremely primitive level that this is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.339" end="01:03:09.670" style="s2">useful skill even for a plant or a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:12.339" style="s2">protozoa to be able to sort of to feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.670" end="01:03:15.489" style="s2">its way into the shape of something else</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.339" end="01:03:19.660" style="s2">which you know every plant has to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.489" end="01:03:22.839" style="s2">that with its niche yep um well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.660" end="01:03:28.509" style="s2">know about the sentience of plants it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.839" end="01:03:34.299" style="s2">up in the air that would I do think</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.509" end="01:03:36.429" style="s2">there&#39;s I so I&#39;m caught between two</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.299" end="01:03:38.709" style="s2">things as you know in my work I really</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.429" end="01:03:40.630" style="s2">emphasize deep continuity between us you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.709" end="01:03:41.949" style="s2">know and Nietzsche said this bring back</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.630" end="01:03:43.839" style="s2">meat you know the height of my</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.949" end="01:03:47.949" style="s2">spirituality reaches into the depths of</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.839" end="01:03:50.619" style="s2">my sexuality right so I agree with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.949" end="01:03:53.890" style="s2">deep continuity but I think we need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.619" end="01:03:55.809" style="s2">remember something about us we we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.890" end="01:03:58.390" style="s2">the most self malleable creatures on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.809" end="01:04:01.959" style="s2">planet we often think about that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.390" end="01:04:04.479" style="s2">know cognitively we&#39;re but even have</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.959" end="01:04:06.740" style="s2">bodies like we transform our bodies in</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.479" end="01:04:09.619" style="s2">ways in which other organisms just</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.740" end="01:04:12.200" style="s2">don&#39;t do that right and our bodies are</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.619" end="01:04:13.910" style="s2">sort of multi-up for being trained in</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.200" end="01:04:16.280" style="s2">too many different kinds of niches</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.910" end="01:04:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird and so and I think those</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.280" end="01:04:18.860" style="s2">two are not disconnected the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.510" end="01:04:20.930" style="s2">malleability of our mind the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.860" end="01:04:23.420" style="s2">malleability of our body I think are</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.930" end="01:04:25.340" style="s2">really important so while I do agree</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.420" end="01:04:28.100" style="s2">with the deep continuity I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.340" end="01:04:29.840" style="s2">something is especially important about</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.100" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">us there&#39;s an important difference this</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.840" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">we sort of about a neon tech you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.020" end="01:04:41.810" style="s2">amplification of both cognitive and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.619" end="01:04:43.790" style="s2">physiological malleability and we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.810" end="01:04:45.770" style="s2">a part of the physiological malleability</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.790" end="01:04:48.619" style="s2">of course is you know interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.770" end="01:04:50.720" style="s2">tools and things like that but we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.619" end="01:04:53.830" style="s2">weird that way like imagine if we found</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.720" end="01:05:00.760" style="s2">a bunch of chimps training for racing</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.830" end="01:05:03.050" style="s2">something like what are they doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.760" end="01:05:04.730" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to build muscles and</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.050" end="01:05:06.320" style="s2">coordination patterns so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.730" end="01:05:08.150" style="s2">run faster than they&#39;re then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.320" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">here than their coworkers and what that</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.150" end="01:05:14.560" style="s2">would freak us out only we do that kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:17.990" style="s2">of stuff yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.560" end="01:05:20.900" style="s2">fanciful but to imagine the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.990" end="01:05:29.080" style="s2">ecosystem observing us beginning to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.900" end="01:05:32.630" style="s2">beginning to prep for things you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.080" end="01:05:34.250" style="s2">going forward in civilization you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.630" end="01:05:35.720" style="s2">politically and ecologically and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.250" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">economically and everything we have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.720" end="01:05:42.190" style="s2">face going forward whether this requires</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:46.369" style="s2">an increase in our malleability or not</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.190" end="01:05:47.450" style="s2">yeah I think so so let&#39;s do the shamans</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.369" end="01:05:48.950" style="s2">again because they&#39;re very helpful you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.450" end="01:05:51.140" style="s2">know the work from what Michael Weyman</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.950" end="01:05:52.070" style="s2">Michael welcome and others especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.140" end="01:05:55.940" style="s2">Matt Rossano</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.070" end="01:05:58.010" style="s2">whole host of people if I mean it looks</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.940" end="01:06:00.710" style="s2">like you know shamans are often a small</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.010" end="01:06:04.280" style="s2">percentage in your population something</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.710" end="01:06:05.630" style="s2">like somebody was quoted a four percent</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.280" end="01:06:06.859" style="s2">to me and I took I take the person</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.630" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">seriously but I haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.859" end="01:06:12.020" style="s2">track down a specific reference but that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">seems anyway is not problematic you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.020" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">most of the people in your group aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:17.720" style="s2">Shona well what was really important</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:20.260" style="s2">about them and this is matress a nose</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.720" end="01:06:22.600" style="s2">argument he&#39;s our biggest advantage</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.260" end="01:06:24.670" style="s2">when we almost disappeared as a species</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.600" end="01:06:26.650" style="s2">somewhere between a hundred thousand and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.670" end="01:06:28.300" style="s2">seventy thousand years ago right because</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.650" end="01:06:30.970" style="s2">we really bottleneck we were dropped our</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.300" end="01:06:32.200" style="s2">numbers drop dramatically and he argues</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.970" end="01:06:34.570" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.200" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">archaeological evidence that of course</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.570" end="01:06:38.320" style="s2">we started to evolve more cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.630" style="s2">flexibility and we started to evolve art</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.320" end="01:06:42.750" style="s2">and stuff like that so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.630" end="01:06:45.670" style="s2">constant we&#39;re saying but he also</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.750" end="01:06:47.470" style="s2">emphasizes that the shamans what they</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.670" end="01:06:49.150" style="s2">what they did is they develop that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.470" end="01:06:51.490" style="s2">develop their shape-shifting their</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.150" end="01:06:52.840" style="s2">identity malleability because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.490" end="01:06:56.560" style="s2">the people that helped set up the trade</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.840" end="01:06:59.290" style="s2">networks and that was our best that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.560" end="01:07:01.840" style="s2">our big and best response we what we do</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.290" end="01:07:04.120" style="s2">is we open up the economy of our</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.840" end="01:07:05.980" style="s2">existence so that we are not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.120" end="01:07:09.040" style="s2">bound to just the local environment</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.980" end="01:07:11.050" style="s2">where we are so the shamans because of</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.040" end="01:07:13.860" style="s2">their shape-shifting ability were able</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.050" end="01:07:16.750" style="s2">to mediate between different communities</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.860" end="01:07:19.180" style="s2">which is a freaking ly weird thing we</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.750" end="01:07:21.190" style="s2">are again civilization is the skill of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.180" end="01:07:22.120" style="s2">living with strangers millions of them</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.190" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.120" end="01:07:26.920" style="s2">uh and so they were able to mediate</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">their material shape-shifting</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.920" end="01:07:30.310" style="s2">malleability actually afforded</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:31.900" style="s2">integrations between communities and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.310" end="01:07:34.390" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we need right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.900" end="01:07:36.340" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we need right now we</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.390" end="01:07:39.400" style="s2">need people who are much more we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.340" end="01:07:40.810" style="s2">need everybody to do that that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.400" end="01:07:42.700" style="s2">did their little preamble about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.810" end="01:07:45.010" style="s2">percentages but we need a significant</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.700" end="01:07:47.530" style="s2">percentage of people that are recognized</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.010" end="01:07:50.920" style="s2">for this role and start to undertake it</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.530" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">and be you know supported in some way by</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.920" end="01:07:54.970" style="s2">the society I don&#39;t mean by the state</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:57.910" style="s2">but by the Society for undertaking this</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.970" end="01:08:01.270" style="s2">task yeah I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.910" end="01:08:03.040" style="s2">what we need we need cyber shamans or</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.270" end="01:08:05.800" style="s2">something like that right where that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.040" end="01:08:12.250" style="s2">that skill of being able to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.800" end="01:08:14.050" style="s2">across domains um I sometimes in in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.250" end="01:08:15.430" style="s2">playful manner I think you know that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.050" end="01:08:17.049" style="s2">being a cognitive scientist is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.430" end="01:08:18.940" style="s2">like being a shaman because I have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.049" end="01:08:20.740" style="s2">develop the capacity to integrate across</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.940" end="01:08:22.450" style="s2">these different worlds these different</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.740" end="01:08:24.100" style="s2">disciplines that you speak different</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.450" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">languages and have different customs and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.100" end="01:08:29.910" style="s2">different ways of gathering their</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:32.109" style="s2">evidence and and so I do think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.910" end="01:08:34.090" style="s2">finding individuals who have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.109" end="01:08:36.460" style="s2">capacity for that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.090" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">malleability and synoptic integration</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.460" end="01:08:41.170" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s crucial going for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.560" end="01:08:42.280" style="s2">I thought I would be stronger I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.170" end="01:08:44.440" style="s2">see how we&#39;re going to get through all</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.280" end="01:08:48.130" style="s2">of this unless we have more individuals</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.440" end="01:08:52.060" style="s2">like that that are recognized and are in</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.130" end="01:08:54.730" style="s2">some way supported by their society yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.060" end="01:08:57.310" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely the synoptic capacity</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.730" end="01:08:59.500" style="s2">is huge I think in what the shaman does</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.310" end="01:09:01.780" style="s2">there&#39;s this other thing of being</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.500" end="01:09:04.030" style="s2">something of a professional outlier oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.780" end="01:09:06.070" style="s2">yes right and how do you set up an</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.030" end="01:09:08.470" style="s2">institution in which the professional</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.070" end="01:09:11.650" style="s2">outlier of the village is taken</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.470" end="01:09:13.390" style="s2">seriously on topics that are significant</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.650" end="01:09:17.200" style="s2">to the villagers now I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.390" end="01:09:19.930" style="s2">saw World War Z yes yeah but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.200" end="01:09:22.990" style="s2">beautiful part in there where the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.930" end="01:09:25.480" style="s2">Israelis built an anti zombie wall yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.990" end="01:09:27.910" style="s2">cuz they have military doctrine called</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.480" end="01:09:30.430" style="s2">the tenth man where if if nine guys</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.910" end="01:09:32.380" style="s2">agree the 10th guys supposed to disagree</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.430" end="01:09:34.570" style="s2">and start acting on his disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.380" end="01:09:36.310" style="s2">right so the first time guys go</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.570" end="01:09:38.590" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s no zombie attack coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.310" end="01:09:40.570" style="s2">that&#39;s preposterous the 10th man is</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.590" end="01:09:43.000" style="s2">supposed to take that seriously and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.570" end="01:09:45.570" style="s2">begin preparing for the zombie attack so</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.000" end="01:09:49.630" style="s2">he&#39;s a situation which there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.570" end="01:09:51.220" style="s2">institutionally valued outlier which</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.630" end="01:09:53.590" style="s2">seems to be part of what the ancient</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.220" end="01:09:56.050" style="s2">role of shamanism right now we have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.590" end="01:10:00.610" style="s2">problem where a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.050" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">are really significant to the unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.610" end="01:10:06.460" style="s2">of culture outside of one say election</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.000" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">cycle or business cycle these things are</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.460" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">being spoken of by people who are a bit</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.010" style="s2">like outliers yeah but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:14.020" style="s2">folded into the heart of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.010" end="01:10:16.390" style="s2">institutions we&#39;re not taking action on</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.020" end="01:10:18.970" style="s2">that information we&#39;re not valuing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.390" end="01:10:21.150" style="s2">outlier institutionally in the right way</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.970" end="01:10:25.300" style="s2">yeah it seems to be very problematic</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.150" end="01:10:27.940" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s right I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.300" end="01:10:30.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think that judge completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.940" end="01:10:33.010" style="s2">with the point I was trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.010" end="01:10:35.110" style="s2">about the fact that we neglect and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.010" end="01:10:39.090" style="s2">marginalize these people it&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.110" end="01:10:42.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost the the connoisseurship</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.090" end="01:10:43.900" style="s2">you know the the discriminating</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.460" end="01:10:46.350" style="s2">awareness to be able to distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.900" end="01:10:47.620" style="s2">these people from people are gorgeous</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.350" end="01:10:51.720" style="s2">not be</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.620" end="01:10:55.570" style="s2">messed up or or or or trying to con us</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.720" end="01:10:57.220" style="s2">right you know so we we don&#39;t want we</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.570" end="01:10:58.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to mistake the criminal for</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.220" end="01:11:02.730" style="s2">the shaman and we don&#39;t want to mistake</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.930" end="01:11:06.010" style="s2">the psychotic for the shaman and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.730" end="01:11:08.470" style="s2">because we have we used to train</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.010" end="01:11:10.210" style="s2">individuals think about this we used to</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.470" end="01:11:13.030" style="s2">train individuals in that discernment</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.210" end="01:11:14.980" style="s2">right so there was an apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.030" end="01:11:16.270" style="s2">that you know the shamans were good at</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.980" end="01:11:18.190" style="s2">finding the other people that would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.270" end="01:11:20.320" style="s2">shamans right and that was part of their</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.190" end="01:11:24.030" style="s2">job and the same thing you know it used</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:26.800" style="s2">to be within the church you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.030" end="01:11:30.190" style="s2">the churches of course subject to all</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.800" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">kinds of critique sir but you know do do</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.190" end="01:11:37.660" style="s2">the church for a very long time was</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:40.210" style="s2">successful did he knows things at times</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.660" end="01:11:41.860" style="s2">but so has every institution like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.210" end="01:11:44.440" style="s2">state and the market do so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.860" end="01:11:46.030" style="s2">picking on the church but I was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.440" end="01:11:48.910" style="s2">thinking about how the church was able</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.030" end="01:11:50.920" style="s2">to cycle between the mystic right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.910" end="01:11:53.470" style="s2">the priests right so the priest</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.920" end="01:11:56.020" style="s2">represents the orthodoxy block but the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.470" end="01:12:00.040" style="s2">church found mechanisms of sainthood</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.020" end="01:12:02.410" style="s2">right and setting up new orders of monks</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.040" end="01:12:05.980" style="s2">you know it found ways of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.410" end="01:12:07.990" style="s2">manage those if sorry that sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.980" end="01:12:10.300" style="s2">it was being purely instrumental I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.990" end="01:12:14.200" style="s2">there was genuine love at times but it</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.300" end="01:12:16.780" style="s2">found ways of getting these people into</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.200" end="01:12:18.670" style="s2">kind of like you said they are validated</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.780" end="01:12:21.210" style="s2">by the culture without the demand that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.670" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">they become completely conforming to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.210" end="01:12:29.050" style="s2">sort of the standard norm so we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:30.460" style="s2">been well I mean we&#39;re never perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.050" end="01:12:32.200" style="s2">successful at this because we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.460" end="01:12:34.630" style="s2">human beings that we we were prone to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.200" end="01:12:36.340" style="s2">envy and pride and you know and doing</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.630" end="01:12:38.650" style="s2">nasty things to each other so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.340" end="01:12:41.560" style="s2">speaking when they in some sort of rows</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.650" end="01:12:43.660" style="s2">with rose-colored glasses but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.560" end="01:12:50.410" style="s2">that that lasted for a long time right</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.660" end="01:12:55.210" style="s2">the ability to venerate the mystic and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.410" end="01:12:58.930" style="s2">and give a place for that challenging</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.210" end="01:13:00.370" style="s2">voice within a long-standing traditional</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.930" end="01:13:04.030" style="s2">institution so</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.370" end="01:13:08.950" style="s2">we can do it we can do it interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.030" end="01:13:11.230" style="s2">me about that is because it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.950" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">so many times it seems like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.230" end="01:13:18.940" style="s2">dependent upon us remembering to do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:21.820" style="s2">but rather like when things are going</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.940" end="01:13:23.230" style="s2">well we spontaneously do it and when</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.820" end="01:13:25.480" style="s2">things aren&#39;t going well we do the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.230" end="01:13:28.300" style="s2">opposite right if there&#39;s some basic</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.480" end="01:13:30.520" style="s2">condition of healthy social organization</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.300" end="01:13:32.710" style="s2">and healthy bodies healthy minds and</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.520" end="01:13:36.580" style="s2">whatever that is all together you might</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.710" end="01:13:39.190" style="s2">say that that leads us to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.580" end="01:13:42.310" style="s2">and take advantage of something that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.190" end="01:13:44.260" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing all along and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.310" end="01:13:46.930" style="s2">there&#39;s some process that goes wrong</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.260" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">which leads us to not do that instead to</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.930" end="01:13:52.660" style="s2">not just not incorporate the outlier but</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:55.440" style="s2">to fall back into a purity and</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.660" end="01:13:57.940" style="s2">homogeneity mode yeah if the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.440" end="01:14:00.220" style="s2">too much complication and we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.940" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">start cutting ourselves until we get</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.220" end="01:14:06.580" style="s2">down to an adequately homogeneous so</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:07.960" style="s2">yeah and and I think that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.580" end="01:14:10.660" style="s2">that goes towards the the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.960" end="01:14:14.380" style="s2">scarcity mentality so people do that</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.660" end="01:14:17.140" style="s2">thing you&#39;re just describing typically</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.380" end="01:14:19.300" style="s2">when they are well whether in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.140" end="01:14:26.320" style="s2">scarcity mentality where some highly</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.300" end="01:14:28.210" style="s2">valued thing is is is diminishing for</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.320" end="01:14:31.510" style="s2">those people obviously you know it could</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.210" end="01:14:35.820" style="s2">be things like food or water or security</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.510" end="01:14:40.150" style="s2">but it can also be things like you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.820" end="01:14:42.550" style="s2">meaning or participation a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.150" end="01:14:44.770" style="s2">belonging to a group these are all</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.550" end="01:14:47.320" style="s2">things that if people are starving for</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.770" end="01:14:49.960" style="s2">them and I think ins sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.320" end="01:14:52.900" style="s2">maybe Maslow or Aristotelian sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.960" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">hierarchy of needs but as what if people</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.900" end="01:14:55.570" style="s2">are starving for them I think that they</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.570" end="01:14:59.940" style="s2">that&#39;s what scarcity mentality shows</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.160" end="01:15:02.830" style="s2">people do this under scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.940" end="01:15:05.950" style="s2">because this is to get you to try and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.830" end="01:15:08.920" style="s2">hoard and exploit what is closest to you</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.950" end="01:15:10.930" style="s2">because it has a higher it has it has a</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.920" end="01:15:12.820" style="s2">probability of one for close to one</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.930" end="01:15:14.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s near you right where is</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.820" end="01:15:16.630" style="s2">that long-term stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.140" end="01:15:18.940" style="s2">oh now the probability is low and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.630" end="01:15:22.120" style="s2">when it&#39;s scarce if it&#39;s scarce here</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.940" end="01:15:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not gonna be not gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.120" end="01:15:26.500" style="s2">found there at all so I better horde</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.920" end="01:15:28.450" style="s2">what I have here now and ration it out</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.500" end="01:15:31.660" style="s2">for myself and the people I want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.450" end="01:15:35.530" style="s2">survive so I think scarcity mentality is</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.660" end="01:15:37.450" style="s2">really relevant to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.530" end="01:15:42.420" style="s2">and then that means we need a culture</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.450" end="01:15:47.080" style="s2">that is much more concerned with</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.420" end="01:15:50.560" style="s2">alleviating scarcity mentality in many</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.080" end="01:15:52.300" style="s2">many different domains and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:54.940" style="s2">different way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.300" end="01:15:56.520" style="s2">function of governance right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.940" end="01:16:00.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a full circle back to</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.520" end="01:16:03.280" style="s2">superficial meaning making here because</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.090" end="01:16:04.930" style="s2">if you confront a piece of art that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:06.790" style="s2">don&#39;t immediately know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.930" end="01:16:08.890" style="s2">supposed to do with it right then</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.790" end="01:16:11.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a scarcity there and you might</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.890" end="01:16:12.970" style="s2">recoil right rather than thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.080" end="01:16:15.010" style="s2">there&#39;s an investment you can make and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.970" end="01:16:16.780" style="s2">at the same time you could have as we</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.010" end="01:16:19.480" style="s2">all do now and you know the hyper</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.780" end="01:16:21.400" style="s2">somatic digital environment there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.480" end="01:16:24.690" style="s2">immense number of incoming information</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.400" end="01:16:27.760" style="s2">streams yeah but if we&#39;re if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.690" end="01:16:28.960" style="s2">assimilating that and even though we</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.760" end="01:16:31.750" style="s2">have all this data</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.960" end="01:16:33.400" style="s2">we&#39;re undergoing a meaning scarcity yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.750" end="01:16:35.260" style="s2">basically there&#39;s a scarcity of</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.400" end="01:16:38.020" style="s2">understanding which makes us behave</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.260" end="01:16:40.750" style="s2">reactively and acquisitive lee and it</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.020" end="01:16:42.250" style="s2">might even create this vicious circle</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.750" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">where you then try to get more</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.250" end="01:16:46.990" style="s2">information and you still don&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:48.940" style="s2">sense of meaning so you don&#39;t escape so</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.990" end="01:16:52.390" style="s2">you try to get more information are you</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.940" end="01:16:54.430" style="s2">trapped yeah I agree I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.390" end="01:16:57.310" style="s2">think that&#39;s very much you know a modal</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.430" end="01:17:00.280" style="s2">confusion around information yeah very</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.310" end="01:17:02.800" style="s2">very much and you sort of get like junk</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.280" end="01:17:04.090" style="s2">attention because you paint you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.800" end="01:17:06.250" style="s2">paying more and more attention to more</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.090" end="01:17:08.680" style="s2">and more information but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.250" end="01:17:11.650" style="s2">acquiring understanding or knowledge or</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.680" end="01:17:13.690" style="s2">even wisdom yeah I I think that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.650" end="01:17:18.040" style="s2">very much is happening for us as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.690" end="01:17:21.130" style="s2">culture it probably is one of the fuels</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.040" end="01:17:23.410" style="s2">of conspiracy thinking because I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.130" end="01:17:25.450" style="s2">people are if they sense that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.410" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">very natural impulse and in a way a</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.450" end="01:17:29.680" style="s2">healthy impulsed to say I need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:32.200" style="s2">Eve a whole bunch of this together</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.680" end="01:17:35.380" style="s2">someone else yeah need a more synoptic</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.200" end="01:17:39.460" style="s2">gaze yeah and I may be doing it out of</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.380" end="01:17:41.680" style="s2">this scarcity mode and therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.460" end="01:17:43.750" style="s2">failing and I&#39;m grasping at things too</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.680" end="01:17:46.030" style="s2">fast and I&#39;m not betting the information</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.750" end="01:17:48.630" style="s2">properly it&#39;s actually a pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.030" end="01:17:51.220" style="s2">impulse to try to get this</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.630" end="01:17:53.440" style="s2">interconnected even mythologically</p>

<p begin="01:17:53.440" end="01:17:58.210" style="s2">when you&#39;re faced by endless incoming</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.080" end="01:18:00.580" style="s2">information streams yeah I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.210" end="01:18:02.350" style="s2">that I mean I&#39;ve talked about the rise</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.580" end="01:18:05.830" style="s2">of conspiracy theories during this</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.350" end="01:18:08.950" style="s2">crisis the Cova crisis there was a video</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.830" end="01:18:11.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not up there anymore that I did for</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.950" end="01:18:12.970" style="s2">rebel wisdom David took it down not</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.740" end="01:18:14.980" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t like the video but</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.970" end="01:18:18.420" style="s2">because he&#39;s involved in investigating a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.980" end="01:18:21.310" style="s2">conspiracy theory right now well right</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.420" end="01:18:24.760" style="s2">or sorry he&#39;s involved in investigating</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.310" end="01:18:26.770" style="s2">an individual who uses conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.760" end="01:18:30.100" style="s2">theories in order to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.770" end="01:18:32.050" style="s2">exploit people and so and he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.100" end="01:18:33.700" style="s2">good work about that but I&#39;ve talked a</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.050" end="01:18:35.440" style="s2">lot about how you know conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.700" end="01:18:37.300" style="s2">thinking it just and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.440" end="01:18:38.560" style="s2">experimental work to validate exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.300" end="01:18:39.940" style="s2">what you said if you put people in</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.560" end="01:18:42.130" style="s2">situations where they feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.940" end="01:18:44.680" style="s2">losing control they are much more likely</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.130" end="01:18:47.650" style="s2">to see losery patterns much more likely</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.680" end="01:18:48.250" style="s2">to accept conspiracy theories very very</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.650" end="01:18:52.090" style="s2">much so</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.250" end="01:18:53.530" style="s2">scarcity of control it is really</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.090" end="01:18:54.970" style="s2">important and not in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.530" end="01:18:58.270" style="s2">mastery but the sense of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.970" end="01:18:59.680" style="s2">interact effectively is definitely</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.270" end="01:19:02.230" style="s2">predictive and you know and what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.680" end="01:19:04.450" style="s2">said getting looking for a predictive</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.230" end="01:19:07.480" style="s2">pattern is what is the brain&#39;s initial</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.450" end="01:19:11.500" style="s2">response you know and and we&#39;re disposed</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.480" end="01:19:14.260" style="s2">to you know to be overly vigilant for</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.500" end="01:19:16.270" style="s2">agents in our environment again prospect</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.260" end="01:19:18.960" style="s2">and refuge is anybody watching me is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.270" end="01:19:21.610" style="s2">there anybody behind the trees right</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.960" end="01:19:27.730" style="s2">that&#39;s also that I think Inspira see</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.610" end="01:19:29.530" style="s2">theories tap into all kinds adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.730" end="01:19:31.810" style="s2">machinery that has been constellated</p>

<p begin="01:19:38.500" end="01:19:41.619" style="s2">processing and I think that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.510" end="01:19:44.260" style="s2">the case now</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.619" end="01:19:46.510" style="s2">the problem with people sometimes humid</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.260" end="01:19:48.129" style="s2">doing that part of what happens is like</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.510" end="01:19:49.869" style="s2">this is the thing I do that pisses off</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.129" end="01:19:51.399" style="s2">the most people were generally because</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.869" end="01:19:53.409" style="s2">one group of people are pissed off</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.399" end="01:19:56.019" style="s2">because I&#39;ve sort of challenged their</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.409" end="01:19:58.179" style="s2">their particular conspiracy theory I</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.019" end="01:20:00.789" style="s2">don&#39;t care if I upset them because I</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.179" end="01:20:02.199" style="s2">think they need to be upset but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.789" end="01:20:05.019" style="s2">other groups of people who say but there</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.199" end="01:20:06.819" style="s2">have been conspiracies right like I</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.019" end="01:20:08.349" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.819" end="01:20:10.059" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to miss the real ones</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.349" end="01:20:12.939" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the that&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.059" end="01:20:16.479" style="s2">way of framing this it&#39;s like well what</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.939" end="01:20:19.689" style="s2">are the best tools for distinguishing</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.479" end="01:20:23.379" style="s2">the losery conspiracies from finding the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.689" end="01:20:26.109" style="s2">real ones I think I think and it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.379" end="01:20:30.099" style="s2">about again learning to pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.109" end="01:20:32.530" style="s2">the right way discern you know yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.099" end="01:20:35.050" style="s2">practice in areas where you can check it</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.530" end="01:20:36.879" style="s2">practice the skills in the little right</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.050" end="01:20:38.530" style="s2">we&#39;re safe where you can check it and</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.879" end="01:20:42.659" style="s2">then gradually see if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.530" end="01:20:46.419" style="s2">transferable right etcetera etcetera</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.659" end="01:20:48.399" style="s2">yeah I when I think of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.419" end="01:20:50.859" style="s2">theories which are very easy to dismiss</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.399" end="01:20:53.109" style="s2">as if they were a homogeneous mass yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.859" end="01:20:55.119" style="s2">I always say to myself like one in ten</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.109" end="01:20:57.879" style="s2">one in ten conspiracy theories is</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.119" end="01:21:00.069" style="s2">correct I just don&#39;t know which one and</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.879" end="01:21:02.829" style="s2">at the same time there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.069" end="01:21:05.439" style="s2">conspiracy that isn&#39;t mentioned in</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.829" end="01:21:06.819" style="s2">anybody&#39;s theory that&#39;s too strange yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.439" end="01:21:08.829" style="s2">they haven&#39;t thought of it doesn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.819" end="01:21:11.889" style="s2">within their paradigms and it&#39;s real as</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.829" end="01:21:14.139" style="s2">well not be you know discernment is</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.889" end="01:21:19.149" style="s2">invoked by both those positions yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.139" end="01:21:21.399" style="s2">what you see addressed in me was the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.149" end="01:21:24.489" style="s2">we grasped for something out of scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.399" end="01:21:27.429" style="s2">and the possible ways of channeling that</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.489" end="01:21:30.249" style="s2">or using it productively like I do</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.429" end="01:21:31.599" style="s2">breath holding and cold showers and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.249" end="01:21:34.149" style="s2">know you&#39;re probably familiar with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.599" end="01:21:36.280" style="s2">Zen parable of the master who holds his</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.149" end="01:21:37.179" style="s2">students head under the water yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.280" end="01:21:38.589" style="s2">he says you know what do you want</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.179" end="01:21:40.749" style="s2">enlightenment as much as you want air</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.589" end="01:21:43.269" style="s2">then you&#39;ll have it there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.749" end="01:21:45.399" style="s2">application of a petition that a</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.269" end="01:21:47.379" style="s2">scarcity could be used to produce if</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.399" end="01:21:50.559" style="s2">it&#39;s used within the right framework</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.379" end="01:21:54.099" style="s2">yeah fasting fasting is the you find</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.559" end="01:21:55.180" style="s2">fasting not only of food but from sex or</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.099" end="01:21:57.340" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.180" end="01:21:59.410" style="s2">strategies used throughout the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.340" end="01:22:03.970" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s where we can use</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.410" end="01:22:06.670" style="s2">scarcity as a disruptive strategy which</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.970" end="01:22:08.440" style="s2">and you know shamans make terrific use</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.670" end="01:22:10.150" style="s2">of disruptive strategies because I see</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.440" end="01:22:12.310" style="s2">because as I would argue we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.150" end="01:22:13.990" style="s2">increasing evidence that getting the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.310" end="01:22:16.210" style="s2">right amount of disruption and</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.990" end="01:22:20.140" style="s2">distraction into your problem framing is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.210" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">provocative of insight and so or in</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.140" end="01:22:23.440" style="s2">machine learning you know you let the</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:24.580" style="s2">you know you let the neural network run</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.440" end="01:22:26.260" style="s2">for a while and then you throw some</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.580" end="01:22:27.910" style="s2">noise into it because that way it</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.260" end="01:22:30.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t over fit to its particular set</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.910" end="01:22:32.110" style="s2">of data it allows it to generalize and</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.160" end="01:22:35.290" style="s2">become more resilient and pick up on</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.110" end="01:22:38.110" style="s2">right other things are there patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.290" end="01:22:40.570" style="s2">are there other other places in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.110" end="01:22:44.140" style="s2">state space of possibilities um please</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.570" end="01:22:47.830" style="s2">don&#39;t think it also increases the amount</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.140" end="01:22:52.270" style="s2">of orgy that we are investing in our</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.830" end="01:22:55.720" style="s2">active perception mechanisms it can I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.270" end="01:22:59.140" style="s2">mean scarcity can be something that</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.720" end="01:23:02.140" style="s2">motivates people it energizes them but</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.140" end="01:23:04.780" style="s2">scarcity can also erode their sense of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.140" end="01:23:06.460" style="s2">agency think about that narrowing it can</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.780" end="01:23:07.930" style="s2">be a reciprocal narrowing like you get</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.460" end="01:23:10.420" style="s2">with the addict and they it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.930" end="01:23:12.040" style="s2">inconceivable that because the Attic is</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.420" end="01:23:15.220" style="s2">living with a perpetual kind of scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.040" end="01:23:16.780" style="s2">right but the Attic is the the the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.220" end="01:23:18.190" style="s2">can&#39;t be any different than it is and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.780" end="01:23:20.530" style="s2">the addict can&#39;t be any different than</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.190" end="01:23:23.290" style="s2">they are so there you know scarcity can</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.530" end="01:23:24.610" style="s2">also drive reciprocal narrowing into</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.290" end="01:23:26.950" style="s2">which people get kind of a learned</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.610" end="01:23:32.680" style="s2">helplessness right I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.950" end="01:23:34.720" style="s2">helplessness so yeah this is why I mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.680" end="01:23:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a powerful disruptive</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.720" end="01:23:40.300" style="s2">technique which is again why you see it</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:41.950" style="s2">cross culturally cross historically but</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.300" end="01:23:43.750" style="s2">it&#39;s also a particularly dangerous one</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.950" end="01:23:46.810" style="s2">and this is why it&#39;s woven into you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.750" end="01:23:49.420" style="s2">you know you the classic example the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.810" end="01:23:54.670" style="s2">buddha tries asceticism and rejects it</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.420" end="01:24:00.310" style="s2">right precisely because the it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.670" end="01:24:01.840" style="s2">clear that using scarcity a disruptive</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.310" end="01:24:06.310" style="s2">strategy it&#39;s not clear that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.840" end="01:24:08.660" style="s2">benefits always outweigh the costs this</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.310" end="01:24:10.940" style="s2">I mean last time we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.660" end="01:24:13.610" style="s2">my sense of how spirituality and</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.940" end="01:24:15.590" style="s2">religion are done through integrative</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.610" end="01:24:17.690" style="s2">production of overflow but how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.590" end="01:24:19.400" style="s2">only half of it the other half is</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.690" end="01:24:22.100" style="s2">entering into a relationship with this</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.400" end="01:24:24.860" style="s2">overflow yes and being able to use it as</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.100" end="01:24:27.170" style="s2">an evaluative device to analyze the rest</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.860" end="01:24:29.960" style="s2">of your life to some degree yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.170" end="01:24:32.210" style="s2">this sense in which you have access to</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.960" end="01:24:35.030" style="s2">this numinous fullness and that can</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.210" end="01:24:37.940" style="s2">become the standard for action then yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.030" end="01:24:40.400" style="s2">that even scarcity could be ordered by</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.940" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">your experience of a numinous fullness</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.400" end="01:24:44.600" style="s2">but if it isn&#39;t then it&#39;s kind of going</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:46.160" style="s2">in the opposite direction from that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.600" end="01:24:49.000" style="s2">I agree with that completely I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.160" end="01:24:51.560" style="s2">that&#39;s very right I see that also that</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.000" end="01:24:53.960" style="s2">even people have even when you were</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.560" end="01:24:59.000" style="s2">doing the first stage what you said like</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.960" end="01:25:01.760" style="s2">shifting from intimacy within the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.000" end="01:25:04.700" style="s2">overflow to intimacy with the overflow</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.760" end="01:25:07.580" style="s2">like that&#39;s the thing I&#39;m trying to sort</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.700" end="01:25:10.700" style="s2">of work into circling practices because</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.580" end="01:25:14.540" style="s2">the circling tends to be intimacy within</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.700" end="01:25:17.630" style="s2">the overflow but there isn&#39;t very been</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.540" end="01:25:20.330" style="s2">trying to say well zoom out and then try</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.630" end="01:25:22.940" style="s2">to become cultivate intimacy with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.330" end="01:25:25.400" style="s2">overflow because that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.940" end="01:25:28.760" style="s2">thing and then like you said it can then</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.400" end="01:25:32.080" style="s2">become an enacted present normative</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.760" end="01:25:35.710" style="s2">field right by which you can explore</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.080" end="01:25:39.890" style="s2">things cultivate discernment you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.710" end="01:25:41.570" style="s2">try to get new insight into how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.890" end="01:25:45.410" style="s2">formulating your identity in the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.570" end="01:25:47.060" style="s2">exactly but it is telling sorry this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.410" end="01:25:49.640" style="s2">not meant to be self emotional it is</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.060" end="01:25:52.270" style="s2">telling that you know I have to say that</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.640" end="01:25:54.500" style="s2">right it&#39;s like people can very easily</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.270" end="01:25:56.360" style="s2">and I think you&#39;ve kept putting your</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.500" end="01:25:59.090" style="s2">finger back on people can very easily</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.360" end="01:26:02.090" style="s2">get entrenched with just being in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.090" end="01:26:04.310" style="s2">overflow and never stepping back to come</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.090" end="01:26:06.440" style="s2">into a right relationship and intimacy</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.310" end="01:26:08.180" style="s2">with the overflow itself and I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.440" end="01:26:10.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of dialectical</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.180" end="01:26:12.410" style="s2">practice about bringing that if you if</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.820" end="01:26:14.870" style="s2">you&#39;re getting it through conversational</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.410" end="01:26:17.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re experiencing overflow in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.870" end="01:26:19.250" style="s2">conversational discourse manner and part</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.120" end="01:26:22.340" style="s2">of that electic is to do exactly that to</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.250" end="01:26:25.719" style="s2">shift off of intimacy within or</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.340" end="01:26:29.960" style="s2">were float to intimacy with overflow</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.719" end="01:26:33.409" style="s2">yeah the most generous definition of</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.960" end="01:26:35.510" style="s2">religion I think involves a social</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.409" end="01:26:37.670" style="s2">process which calls us to do that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.510" end="01:26:41.330" style="s2">yes which cites something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.670" end="01:26:44.179" style="s2">additional - or even beyond mysticism in</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.330" end="01:26:47.090" style="s2">terms of its responsibility for engaging</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.179" end="01:26:49.639" style="s2">that like even even what we just did in</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.090" end="01:26:51.889" style="s2">discussing now if the numinous overflow</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.639" end="01:26:55.010" style="s2">right we&#39;re there now faithful to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.889" end="01:26:56.989" style="s2">Lord so to speak right we we&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.010" end="01:26:59.360" style="s2">we&#39;re referencing it we&#39;re honoring it</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.989" end="01:27:02.090" style="s2">calling it forth yes I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.360" end="01:27:04.909" style="s2">faithfulness to the logos is exactly at</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.090" end="01:27:07.340" style="s2">the heart of Dia logos by way up by</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.909" end="01:27:09.199" style="s2">means of it right it&#39;s a faithfulness</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.340" end="01:27:13.460" style="s2">like we talked about earlier to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.199" end="01:27:15.889" style="s2">logos and especially insofar as the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.460" end="01:27:17.900" style="s2">faithfulness to the logos affords people</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.889" end="01:27:19.400" style="s2">- well called the big wisdom and love</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.900" end="01:27:21.650" style="s2">etcetera yes</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.400" end="01:27:26.570" style="s2">I totally think that I should get going</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.650" end="01:27:28.909" style="s2">there with certain mystic states and</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.570" end="01:27:31.489" style="s2">certain psychedelic states thinking all</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.909" end="01:27:34.099" style="s2">the way back for Humanity put people in</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.489" end="01:27:36.920" style="s2">a situation where I think they see that</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.099" end="01:27:38.900" style="s2">sort of even visually like I recently</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.920" end="01:27:40.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk on entheogens and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.900" end="01:27:44.330" style="s2">huge part of my life but I&#39;ve had a few</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.670" end="01:27:47.780" style="s2">interesting experiences some of them the</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.330" end="01:27:51.050" style="s2">sense of the numinous other that comes</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.780" end="01:27:54.020" style="s2">forth in the exchange no it is almost</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.050" end="01:27:56.869" style="s2">something you behold right then the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.020" end="01:27:59.210" style="s2">languaging of the divine person makes a</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.869" end="01:28:01.460" style="s2">lot of sense what you see there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.210" end="01:28:02.869" style="s2">other and you actually see it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.460" end="01:28:04.820" style="s2">just in you and it&#39;s not just in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.869" end="01:28:07.489" style="s2">other person no you have this experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.820" end="01:28:09.050" style="s2">a Buddhist class as well as in something</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.489" end="01:28:10.820" style="s2">was sneaking out the back of my head and</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.050" end="01:28:13.849" style="s2">also looking at me through the teachers</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.820" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">eyes very much very much you know Chris</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.849" end="01:28:17.510" style="s2">and I and the chapter we wrote on gnosis</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:19.730" style="s2">in the second person we talked about</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.730" end="01:28:23.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard it the third man factor</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.469" end="01:28:26.750" style="s2">where people are in situations and they</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.540" end="01:28:29.360" style="s2">people sense another presence other than</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.750" end="01:28:31.460" style="s2">the physically and I don&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.360" end="01:28:34.580" style="s2">supernatural I think was in Shackleton</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.460" end="01:28:36.289" style="s2">even though they were on an expedition</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.580" end="01:28:38.960" style="s2">and they all sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.289" end="01:28:41.809" style="s2">they had a sense presence that was not</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.960" end="01:28:43.429" style="s2">any of the people there Geiger has a</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.809" end="01:28:45.650" style="s2">whole book called the third man factor</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.429" end="01:28:47.900" style="s2">this is well documented and the third</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.650" end="01:28:50.360" style="s2">man factor capacity definitely is</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.900" end="01:28:53.599" style="s2">activated when you&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.360" end="01:28:55.699" style="s2">circling practices and Chris and I call</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.599" end="01:28:57.500" style="s2">it therefore the write the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.699" end="01:28:58.940" style="s2">the third factor or Geist because we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:28:58.940" end="01:29:05.690" style="s2">is nice because it moves between mind</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.980" end="01:29:07.730" style="s2">and spirit and sort of you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.690" end="01:29:11.030" style="s2">much it&#39;s much more comprehensive than</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.730" end="01:29:14.150" style="s2">any of the terms that we typically used</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.030" end="01:29:18.349" style="s2">I think yeah I think people get the</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.150" end="01:29:22.309" style="s2">sense of that and they start to relate</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.349" end="01:29:23.710" style="s2">to it as an entity interesting in their</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.309" end="01:29:26.090" style="s2">in sort of recent psychological</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.710" end="01:29:27.679" style="s2">cognitive scientist literature and</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.090" end="01:29:30.920" style="s2">philosophical literature on what is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.679" end="01:29:32.989" style="s2">called we agency that emergent factor</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.920" end="01:29:35.289" style="s2">that above and beyond us the we the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.989" end="01:29:38.929" style="s2">distributed cognition is doing something</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.289" end="01:29:41.539" style="s2">they talked about it now as like like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.929" end="01:29:43.460" style="s2">philosophical zombie it an intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.539" end="01:29:45.289" style="s2">emerges there&#39;s no consciousness to it</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.460" end="01:29:49.010" style="s2">right but there&#39;s an intelligence that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.289" end="01:29:51.679" style="s2">emerges and and it seems to be a real</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.010" end="01:29:53.869" style="s2">sort of a real sort of thing in that it</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.679" end="01:29:58.219" style="s2">can solve problems that the individuals</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.869" end="01:30:00.170" style="s2">can&#39;t solve so I do think there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.219" end="01:30:02.059" style="s2">sort of but there&#39;s good emerging</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.170" end="01:30:04.010" style="s2">cognitive science to underpin everything</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.059" end="01:30:06.530" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.010" end="01:30:08.630" style="s2">help us get a better relationship to it</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.530" end="01:30:11.480" style="s2">but I&#39;m also intrigued by what you said</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.630" end="01:30:13.730" style="s2">about certain states that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.480" end="01:30:16.159" style="s2">synesthetic it goes from being a sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.730" end="01:30:18.619" style="s2">presence to being a visualized presence</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.159" end="01:30:20.269" style="s2">or an encountered presence I remember I</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.619" end="01:30:22.969" style="s2">won&#39;t say when because I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.269" end="01:30:24.769" style="s2">uh there was a time in my life very far</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.969" end="01:30:30.380" style="s2">removed from this time in my life let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.769" end="01:30:36.559" style="s2">say in which I did psilocybin and did</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.380" end="01:30:38.750" style="s2">Tai Chi Chuan and she is kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.559" end="01:30:42.380" style="s2">the internalization it&#39;s the sensed</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.750" end="01:30:44.510" style="s2">presence of the DAO right if you know is</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.380" end="01:30:46.039" style="s2">imaginal transductive thing between you</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.510" end="01:30:47.449" style="s2">and the world and it uses all these</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.039" end="01:30:49.820" style="s2">musical metaphors that we&#39;ve been using</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.449" end="01:30:52.250" style="s2">you know all this</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.820" end="01:30:55.579" style="s2">and so I I have powerful experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.250" end="01:30:56.659" style="s2">that plate regularly right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.579" end="01:30:57.500" style="s2">how you learn how to fight with their</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.659" end="01:31:00.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t stuff like it and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.500" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">magical in in the supernatural istic</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.679" end="01:31:06.230" style="s2">sense but when when I when I was doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:08.599" style="s2">it there was two thirds two aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.230" end="01:31:13.489" style="s2">it that were really cool so I saw a blue</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.599" end="01:31:16.520" style="s2">fire i vision I had a synesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.489" end="01:31:19.130" style="s2">experience of the Qi as blue fire moving</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.520" end="01:31:22.639" style="s2">all over my body and if what was really</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.130" end="01:31:24.920" style="s2">what really kicked it into high gear is</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.639" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">there was this little girl and she came</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.920" end="01:31:31.219" style="s2">and she was staring at me with like</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.679" end="01:31:32.809" style="s2">saucer eyes and somehow I almost fancied</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.219" end="01:31:35.179" style="s2">that she could see the flames as well</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.809" end="01:31:37.190" style="s2">because you know state she was</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.179" end="01:31:40.219" style="s2">definitely picking up on something more</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.190" end="01:31:42.290" style="s2">that was happening to me than what was</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.219" end="01:31:44.420" style="s2">was normally present because she was</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.290" end="01:31:46.880" style="s2">looking at me with and again this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.420" end="01:31:48.440" style="s2">this is not about me she was looking at</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.880" end="01:31:50.750" style="s2">the event that I was involved in with</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.440" end="01:31:53.989" style="s2">Wonder almost ah and was like whoa</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.750" end="01:31:55.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a very powerful experience so</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.989" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">yeah I totally think that would there</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.460" end="01:32:03.739" style="s2">are places where we sin aesthetically</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.000" end="01:32:11.540" style="s2">start to visualize or even how here you</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.739" end="01:32:13.520" style="s2">know that third presence yeah my</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.540" end="01:32:15.380" style="s2">girlfriend and I always have to reach</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.520" end="01:32:17.780" style="s2">for this we just call it the third in</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.380" end="01:32:20.869" style="s2">general yeah like me that our</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.780" end="01:32:22.940" style="s2">relationship is playing a role in our</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.869" end="01:32:25.250" style="s2">relationship in addition to the rule</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.940" end="01:32:28.099" style="s2">that we reach playing yeah and it really</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.250" end="01:32:30.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you can&#39;t really describe it</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.099" end="01:32:34.610" style="s2">properly without that additional factor</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.820" end="01:32:38.420" style="s2">yeah and this is why I mean part of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.610" end="01:32:40.130" style="s2">reason why I&#39;ve spent so much time</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.420" end="01:32:43.639" style="s2">trying to get out this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.130" end="01:32:45.800" style="s2">transductive &#39;ti is because the the what</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.639" end="01:32:47.540" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about is not sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.800" end="01:32:49.460" style="s2">objective and it&#39;s not merely subjective</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.540" end="01:32:52.670" style="s2">it&#39;s transductive in a really really</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.460" end="01:32:55.010" style="s2">powerful way the relation itself what</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.670" end="01:32:57.110" style="s2">we&#39;re saying is the relation itself not</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.010" end="01:33:02.090" style="s2">the relati but the relation itself</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.110" end="01:33:03.349" style="s2">becomes right real actual actual izing</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.090" end="01:33:05.810" style="s2">and present it&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.349" end="01:33:07.849" style="s2">the Galatian itself and I so I think I</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.810" end="01:33:09.170" style="s2">think that&#39;s really really important and</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.849" end="01:33:11.030" style="s2">again I&#39;ve mentioned to you this before</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.170" end="01:33:14.110" style="s2">I&#39;m just impressed by how people from</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.030" end="01:33:17.560" style="s2">various backgrounds often very secular</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.110" end="01:33:20.659" style="s2">both in the religious and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.560" end="01:33:24.860" style="s2">sense and the more general sense we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.659" end="01:33:27.340" style="s2">now they will talk about this with</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.860" end="01:33:30.440" style="s2">religious language just spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.340" end="01:33:33.590" style="s2">because no other language is close</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.440" end="01:33:34.820" style="s2">enough to hit it and that tells us</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.590" end="01:33:36.409" style="s2">something that tells us something about</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.820" end="01:33:38.590" style="s2">what we need to be doing leave me and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.409" end="01:33:41.420" style="s2">gotta get going okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.590" end="01:33:43.130" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s kind of a shot I did try to</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.420" end="01:33:44.150" style="s2">mention it a few minutes earlier but you</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.130" end="01:33:45.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite hear me and then you said</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.150" end="01:33:47.000" style="s2">something that was really interesting in</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.500" end="01:33:50.389" style="s2">performing and we got caught up in it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.000" end="01:33:54.920" style="s2">going indefinitely I&#39;m sure next time</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.389" end="01:33:56.480" style="s2">yeah so I would very much like to make</p>
