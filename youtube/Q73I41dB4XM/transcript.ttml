<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:26.330" style="s2">to stoic practices or how do I fit this</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.330" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship between what</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.370" end="00:16:28.610" style="s2">slowly begin to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:30.200" style="s2">practice trying as best you can to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:31.370" style="s2">integrate what you cultivated in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.200" end="00:16:34.700" style="s2">practice with your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.370" end="00:16:39.190" style="s2">consciousness and cognition coming out</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.700" end="00:16:39.190" style="s2">of your sit it&#39;s part of the properties</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.390" end="00:16:51.370" style="s2">so time for a few questions today</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.950" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">could you Olaf</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.170" end="00:17:00.589" style="s2">got hooked I if I mispronounce your name</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:02.029" style="s2">like all the does I find it very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.589" end="00:17:05.000" style="s2">hard to do the routine and often I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.029" end="00:17:07.610" style="s2">not get past it within 15 minutes I get</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.000" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">really an agitated monkey brain I try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.610" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">do some routing light to reduce the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">yes yeah you can perhaps just right just</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:25.059" style="s2">go to the center do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.230" end="00:17:30.910" style="s2">routing the central line of your head</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.059" end="00:17:35.090" style="s2">maybe one or two breaths just opening</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.910" end="00:17:37.490" style="s2">right just the opening and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.090" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">a melting and draining down to your</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.490" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">heart and then that opening the opening</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.860" end="00:17:44.390" style="s2">you&#39;re getting with the looking and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">listening just they&#39;re opening letting</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.390" end="00:17:50.390" style="s2">it flow and then melting and draining</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:55.730" style="s2">center of your abdomen couple breaths</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.390" end="00:17:57.080" style="s2">just opening letting it flow getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.730" end="00:18:00.410" style="s2">that kind of relaxation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.080" end="00:18:03.110" style="s2">sensitization and stabilization and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.410" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">opening and melting down to the center</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.110" end="00:18:10.850" style="s2">like of your root contact point on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:13.640" style="s2">earth I mean and then opening letting it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.850" end="00:18:16.010" style="s2">flow there and then opening melting</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.640" end="00:18:18.790" style="s2">draining sinking into the earth so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.010" end="00:18:22.250" style="s2">can do that that won&#39;t take you as deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.790" end="00:18:23.900" style="s2">but it will hopefully give you a way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.250" end="00:18:26.870" style="s2">doing as you say a light version of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.900" end="00:18:29.660" style="s2">but still nevertheless get you into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.870" end="00:18:31.610" style="s2">other the relaxation but that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.660" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">both sensitizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.610" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">and a stabilization and affords you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">finding your flow Andre</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">hi Andre it&#39;s good to see you again what</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:49.040" style="s2">you were meant to do what do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.860" end="00:18:50.450" style="s2">remember as myself out of the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.040" end="00:18:53.150" style="s2">like falling asleep or losing</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.450" end="00:18:54.710" style="s2">consciousness so one other thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.150" end="00:18:56.780" style="s2">so this is one of the few instances</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.710" end="00:18:59.990" style="s2">where you do want to direct your</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.780" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">breathing you want to take some very</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.990" end="00:19:05.030" style="s2">deep baby breaths and you want to try</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:07.370" style="s2">and Riaan</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.030" end="00:19:10.490" style="s2">very deeply and your abdomen your heart</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.370" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">all of your torso I don&#39;t do that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.490" end="00:19:13.730" style="s2">don&#39;t hyperventilate but two or three</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:16.460" style="s2">because if only miss lis probably cuz</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.730" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">you&#39;re getting too little oxygen in so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.460" end="00:19:21.110" style="s2">here if you really if this is really</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:23.150" style="s2">becoming a challenge right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.110" end="00:19:26.929" style="s2">just sort of open your mind directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.150" end="00:19:29.030" style="s2">then take some deep breaths and while</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.929" end="00:19:31.790" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the deep breaths really try</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.030" end="00:19:33.770" style="s2">to dive deeply into the flow really get</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.790" end="00:19:36.370" style="s2">the flow going in your abdomen and your</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.770" end="00:19:38.900" style="s2">heart your shoulders and your torso</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.370" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">don&#39;t do that for very long but do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.900" end="00:19:45.950" style="s2">I also recommend I to think of taking up</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">a moving mindfulness practice that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:50.630" style="s2">do just before your you sit because that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:52.669" style="s2">helps to engage the cerebellum it helps</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.630" end="00:19:54.679" style="s2">to oxygenate the blood more and it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.669" end="00:19:57.290" style="s2">help you to remain more awake while</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.679" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting Keira</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:01.640" style="s2">Kruger if something jarring happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.110" end="00:20:03.559" style="s2">right before starting should you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.640" end="00:20:05.240" style="s2">wait until a later time to sit what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.559" end="00:20:06.830" style="s2">nervous system has had a chance to calm</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.240" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">down that&#39;s a good question that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.830" end="00:20:10.790" style="s2">hard question to ask so generally that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.650" style="s2">that goes with how long you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.790" end="00:20:15.740" style="s2">practicing and how deep your practice is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.650" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">going if it&#39;s very jarring I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.740" end="00:20:19.450" style="s2">not trying to sit could you&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:22.660" style="s2">replayed replacing it but I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.450" end="00:20:25.190" style="s2">right doing you know two or three</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.660" end="00:20:27.770" style="s2">open-eyed two and three open-eyed</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.190" end="00:20:29.780" style="s2">following your breaths wherever you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.770" end="00:20:31.640" style="s2">getting a sense of being centered and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.780" end="00:20:33.650" style="s2">rooted and coming in as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.640" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">to the flow feeling within your body</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.650" end="00:20:36.950" style="s2">so yes probably if you&#39;re you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:38.600" style="s2">you&#39;re relatively nervous</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.950" end="00:20:41.330" style="s2">don&#39;t go immediately into sitting if</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.600" end="00:20:43.669" style="s2">something drawing has just happened but</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.330" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">in in that state where you&#39;re right you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.669" end="00:20:47.060" style="s2">wanna you want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.080" end="00:20:48.440" style="s2">you want to train your brain so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.060" end="00:20:50.930" style="s2">when you&#39;re coming into something</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.440" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">jarring it looks to Center and root and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.930" end="00:20:56.750" style="s2">flow and to open up that soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:21:01.190" style="s2">kind of paying attention rather than the</p>
