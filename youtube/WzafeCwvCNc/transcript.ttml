<p begin="00:00:02.000" end="00:00:04.880" style="s2">intangible too much talk not enough</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.000" end="00:00:06.480" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">and so you know you and i have had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">email conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">over the last few days talking a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:13.840" style="s2">bit about how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">describe the phasings of game a and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">some of the sub components</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">might be and i&#39;ve kind of taken that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">little further and i&#39;m going to be game</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">game b people right if i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:24.160" style="s2">something about the future it&#39;s game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">even if game a comes out of my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to i&#39;ve expended extended</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:29.359" style="s2">it to a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">of fairly tangible topics which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.359" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">going to run through</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">relatively rapidly so let&#39;s both try not</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">go down the rabbit hole of digressions</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.079" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">i think we both agreed that a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">way to present the current state</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:43.600" style="s2">we could call the pregame b world or</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">pre-b</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">for short where there doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">exist a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:51.680" style="s2">of a functioning game b group not even a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">small one</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">but there&#39;s lots of things that people</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">are working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">to get ready for that first real step</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">and first you called this out in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">finding the others and that&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">to happen right through twitter through</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">facebook through</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">all traveling around the country and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">meeting to people and telling people</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">about game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s let that one go because</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:14.799" style="s2">that one seems to be happening and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">though of course we&#39;d encourage any of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.799" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">our listeners</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">who think they would like to play game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">to reach out to these</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">connection points we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">earlier the game b group on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">and hashtag gameb on twitter and find</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">others but then the next one i know</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">thinking about this and also starting</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">applying it to your own life</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">is making changes in our lives to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">more game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">ready things like building courage and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">optimism</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">integrity honesty and good faith</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">escaping the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">of status oriented consumerism and being</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">programmed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">psychologically astute mass and social</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">what are some other things in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">changing one&#39;s own life</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">that would you would say fit to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">pre-b world</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">hmm well three things pop up immediately</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if they&#39;re related so one</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">is that i&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">many people who come with a hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">get going</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">attitude have often not done</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">a lot of work on what i would call a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">mind and so there&#39;s a uh what i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">call a naive</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">assumption that the paradigm that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">are very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">whatever it happens to be is the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">and what ends up happening of course is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">that then they reshape the story of game</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">b into something that is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">like their paradigm so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">is to actually take quite seriously</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:39.640" style="s2">this notion of liminality even down to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">the level of what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic mind which is a a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">real thing like that is not a trivial</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">capacity to be aware of the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">axiomatic assumptions that you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">bringing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">into your sense making and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">actually shift between different</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">paradigms as the the arena that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">in changes that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">two is building a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">for orienting your choices</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">on the basis of sensed meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">these two things are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">connected so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">in game a we have we are we are very</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">very separated from developmentally and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">and uh socially separated from our</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">capacity to orient our sense making on</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">the basis of the sense of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">so for example we spend more time on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">bullshit at work than with our kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">and so something is off and yet we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">actually choose the thing that if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">were to spend real time on it as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">we rationalize and or just delude</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">ourselves or ignore</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">and that has to be broken like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">cannot do game b because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">primary piece of the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">is this primordial or prefigured</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">capacity in the human body to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">just notice</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">and be able to be aware of what is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">than other things just to you like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">feels more meaningful just that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">and being able to be like this really</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">concrete</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">self discipline to make sure you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">shit straight</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">in order so if you&#39;re sacrificing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re either radically</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">unaware of what is most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">fix that and then if you are noticing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">that your choices aren&#39;t actually in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">accordance with the values that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">think you hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">fix that and then notice what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">capacity in you that actually allows you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">sense what are the what are the values</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">that are going to orient towards</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">you hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the sense that gives you that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the sense that allows you to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">those values to actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">notice what would seem like really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">choices in</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">uh in front of you you have to relearn a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">lot of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">that was pounded out of you largely by</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">both education</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">and the economy and being able to know</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">what you actually care about and make</p>

<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">i find many many people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">running ideologies which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">they substitute somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">code somebody else&#39;s proposition for</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">in exchange for their own so instead of</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">i actually override myself in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">some particular ideology that has</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">been able to impose itself on me as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">being more important</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">and and therefore more more valuable</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">than the values that my my whole self is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">are actually yearning for</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">that that&#39;s a piece that has to be done</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">let me throw in a tangible you know me i</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">like the tangible</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">you know to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">introduction piece i said you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">need to de-program</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">ourselves from status-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">consumption so if a person thinks they</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">need to have a fancy bmw</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">to be who they are and therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">have to take a high-pressure job with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">90-minute commute</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">so that they can afford this bmw the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">result is they&#39;re not going to have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">time to spend with</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">their children or their spouse or their</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">friends and so they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">taken this ideology which programmed</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">into them by psychologically astute</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">media and advertising and have inserted</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">instead of their actual really</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">meaningful goals</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">yeah absolutely and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">happening in all kinds of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">ways where for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">rather than you know hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">they go to a you know an upwardly mobile</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">business meeting with people that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">very little sense of actual connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">with because in the back of their mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">they don&#39;t even like the jobs they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">got right just you got this huge</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">explosion and what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">is if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a synergy value that shows up</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">the way i&#39;m describing it it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">like freeing your mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">and increasing a capacity to make more</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">meaningful choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">but at the same time it&#39;s also freeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">your economy because if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">addicted to this particular vector of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">status consumption you&#39;re obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">necessarily dependent on as much</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">of a flow of money and this gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">lot more actual freedom</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">exactly and you know at least to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">i strongly suspect that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">roads to getting ready for game b is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">get one&#39;s financial life in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean making more money</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">it may well mean just spending less</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">less less having your buttons pushed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">make you think you need</p>
