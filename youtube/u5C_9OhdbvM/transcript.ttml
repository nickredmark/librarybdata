<p begin="00:00:28.369" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">what should we talk about well I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.239" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">to broach a topic with you because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">trying to enter into a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">discussions around this topic and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:42.270" style="s2">thought you would be a really good</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:45.110" style="s2">person to talk to it&#39;s sort of the main</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:47.340" style="s2">theme that you know my serious is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.110" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">oriented towards and that my channels</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.340" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">building towards and of course i vouched</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">upon it in this series which you know is</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:56.930" style="s2">the relate the modern relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">the current relationship moderns now</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.930" end="00:01:04.519" style="s2">uh-huh yeah a question in terms so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">call it the current relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.519" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">science and spirituality and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">Heidegger has a lot to say about that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">think he does and I was wondering and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">know that you and guy have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">about that and I imagine that when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:23.670" style="s2">three of us talk not that long and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">looking for after that this will give</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.670" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">sort of maybe some preliminary work like</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to resolve anything or</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">anything pretentious like that today but</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">you know get the topic going and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">maybe the three of us could pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">how does that sound as a proposal to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:45.500" style="s2">yeah yeah um so one who I think sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">relatively easy way to start might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.500" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">with Heidegger&#39;s proposal two proposals</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">perhaps that are linked in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">around this question and one proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">that the history of Western metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">is basically the history of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">yeah and and then the other proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">that this is not just an epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">ontology but it&#39;s actually woven into</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">our environmental ontology in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">technology the idea of the way you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">technology has convert has basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:19.410" style="s2">in framed us in that ontology put the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">world in a standing reserve and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.410" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">to me those themes are very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:30.300" style="s2">this relationship between science and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">spirituality in the current time and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.300" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">you know i catched upon those at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">the first one a little bit the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">one but i touched upon the first one in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:42.240" style="s2">so I wanted to hear what your your</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">thoughts are if you think it&#39;s fair for</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.240" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">me to bring those two points together</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:46.980" style="s2">that they&#39;re relevant to this topic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">then what some of your initial thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">are on that yes I think very relevant as</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">you know Heidegger speaks of gish still</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">has the essence of technology which</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">often is translated as in framing or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">could translate also ask positionality</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">or precision ingore the concentration of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:11.070" style="s2">all forceful demanding positioning so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:13.020" style="s2">that everything is turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.070" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">standing reserve standing ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.020" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">exploited for the sake of something else</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:19.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the will to will that kicks in</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:22.050" style="s2">right a will that wills itself you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.380" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">kind of lemon addicts a positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.050" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">feedback loop like that kicks in here as</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:29.820" style="s2">well and that&#39;s I was capital functions</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">like etc well that always runs in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.820" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">parallels of people so Heidegger himself</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">says in an interview with we had mr.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:40.050" style="s2">Richard Wilson late 60s that he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">against technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.050" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t oppose it he if I&#39;m finished</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">getting the Technic I&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:49.800" style="s2">technology I he doesn&#39;t speak of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">demon in technology of the of something</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.800" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">evil that that&#39;s occurring there it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">simply just tries to understand its</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">meaning and he actually also says that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">he sees a preview in technology what he</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">calls a tightness to the event so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:03.660" style="s2">a very interesting quote that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">something we can pick up at some other</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.660" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">point too because that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:11.850" style="s2">but anything that I&#39;d ago when he sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:14.670" style="s2">publicly miss is also very important I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.850" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">think then hiding it becomes a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.670" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">public intellectual because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.060" end="00:04:21.959" style="s2">course of hiding as he sits in his Hut</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">he basically he didn&#39;t he lived there</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.959" end="00:04:24.169" style="s2">when they were younger and they had no</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:27.139" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.169" end="00:04:31.400" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t live there he lived in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.139" end="00:04:33.469" style="s2">Freiburg and with his family and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.400" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">later on back in mezquia in his hometown</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.469" end="00:04:40.520" style="s2">but he did spend time in in the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:43.879" style="s2">course throughout his life but he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.520" end="00:04:45.169" style="s2">also very so as he starts working or</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.879" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">thinking through the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.169" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">technology and its origin he begins to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">be very public so he gives the talk on</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:55.249" style="s2">the question concerning technology at</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">the Technical University of Munich to an</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.249" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">audience of engineers and he gives talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:06.169" style="s2">on traditional language and on original</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:09.259" style="s2">language and technical language to teach</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.169" end="00:05:10.939" style="s2">us to high school teachers so simply to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.259" end="00:05:12.349" style="s2">professionals who will then go out into</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.939" end="00:05:14.659" style="s2">the world and have to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.349" end="00:05:18.379" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but everything he writes</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.659" end="00:05:21.229" style="s2">on technology in framing gift etc is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.379" end="00:05:25.099" style="s2">always in parallel with his writings on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.229" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">the field which is a weird German word</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.099" end="00:05:32.330" style="s2">it means it&#39;s usually translated as</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:37.189" style="s2">fourfold or the four really mortals</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.330" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">awesome earth sky and gods which are or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.189" end="00:05:39.949" style="s2">remain unnamed</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:43.009" style="s2">but there&#39;s that you cannot have one</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.949" end="00:05:45.740" style="s2">without the other so in framing Gish</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.009" end="00:05:47.899" style="s2">there runs almost in parallel these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:49.610" style="s2">two different dimensions we can wear</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.899" end="00:05:50.930" style="s2">kind of in at the same times you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.610" end="00:05:52.779" style="s2">have one without the other and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.930" end="00:05:55.460" style="s2">what you and you would say the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.779" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">technological and the the spiritual are</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.460" end="00:06:02.870" style="s2">right right okay that&#39;s interesting so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:04.819" style="s2">I was taught to translate it as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.870" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">framing and that you said that&#39;s an OK</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.819" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">translation right right so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.449" end="00:06:18.830" style="s2">it you know the positioning you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:20.599" style="s2">understand this that this gets into both</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.830" end="00:06:23.029" style="s2">of these modes that you&#39;ve described the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.599" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">fourfold and the technological and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.029" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">framing like I want to try and translate</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:32.180" style="s2">that into more phenomenological terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:34.370" style="s2">for people what does that mean for</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.180" end="00:06:36.019" style="s2">people like to say that the like when</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.370" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">you say you know everything is put at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.019" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">standing reserve that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.020" end="00:06:40.110" style="s2">like a purely conceptual thing but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:42.539" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply not heidegger&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.110" end="00:06:45.419" style="s2">right yeah I think there&#39;s point is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.539" end="00:06:46.889" style="s2">mean I take it to be something along the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.419" end="00:06:49.020" style="s2">lines you know sort of woven into our</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.889" end="00:06:50.669" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar in a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">profound way so that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.669" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">transparent to us it&#39;s kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:57.030" style="s2">like the lens through which we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:06:59.370" style="s2">ourselves and seeing the world yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.030" end="00:07:01.530" style="s2">that an appropriate way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.370" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s good so transparent I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.530" end="00:07:05.580" style="s2">not thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:09.380" style="s2">term before but it&#39;s it&#39;s so transparent</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.580" end="00:07:11.430" style="s2">that we don&#39;t see it right right right</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">the trouble I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.430" end="00:07:14.610" style="s2">interesting way of putting it when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:17.340" style="s2">say it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s transparent it&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.610" end="00:07:19.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it is it has to do I think with</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.340" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">perspectives and it&#39;s not just so</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.080" end="00:07:23.069" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not about a concept so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.810" end="00:07:24.750" style="s2">Heidegger is not one to give as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.069" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">concept by which to understand he says</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.750" end="00:07:32.449" style="s2">the way that beings now appear to us as</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:34.740" style="s2">for example an airplane or a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.449" end="00:07:37.319" style="s2">there&#39;s almost no dude there is no</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.740" end="00:07:39.770" style="s2">difference because they both in some on</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.319" end="00:07:44.789" style="s2">some different level just stand ready to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.770" end="00:07:46.199" style="s2">serve some some means so it&#39;s all in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.789" end="00:07:49.020" style="s2">different terminology you could say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.199" end="00:07:51.270" style="s2">all yeah yeah and we do right you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:53.400" style="s2">of like human resource departments at</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.270" end="00:07:56.190" style="s2">the University right and your resources</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.400" end="00:07:58.139" style="s2">right and there&#39;s all this idea and from</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.190" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">talked in a similar manner about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.139" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">know the marketing character how we</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:09.750" style="s2">because we&#39;re sort of self promoting</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:11.750" style="s2">commodities under neoliberalism we reach</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.750" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">you know we have our own brand and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.750" end="00:08:18.630" style="s2">because we have to play with that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:21.479" style="s2">to get from within which is you can play</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.630" end="00:08:23.340" style="s2">with that matrix but only I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.479" end="00:08:25.469" style="s2">see it but if you purely think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.340" end="00:08:27.569" style="s2">yourself as a resource you will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.469" end="00:08:29.580" style="s2">exploiting yourself and that&#39;s violent</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.569" end="00:08:32.339" style="s2">language so there&#39;s a certain violence</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:35.520" style="s2">in that to ninety he says how else for</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.339" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">them so in opposition to and it this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.520" end="00:08:40.169" style="s2">a literal opposition to me because he</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:42.390" style="s2">wants us to come back to a primordial</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.169" end="00:08:45.180" style="s2">understanding of nature which is as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">know is fizz&#39;s yeah yeah ignorin so</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.180" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">required to says physics group to stifle</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:52.209" style="s2">a nature likes to hide himself</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:54.459" style="s2">we can&#39;t see nature but the way we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.209" end="00:08:57.069" style="s2">understand nature is that we try to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.459" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">it as a tool for our means and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.069" end="00:09:00.279" style="s2">to do to come at this from a totally</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:01.930" style="s2">different perspective from angle for</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.279" end="00:09:04.600" style="s2">example that has to do with human</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.930" end="00:09:07.899" style="s2">freedom so we are free to do so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.600" end="00:09:11.009" style="s2">kind of our emancipation the current</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.899" end="00:09:13.389" style="s2">discourse on an Deep Ecology</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.009" end="00:09:15.430" style="s2">environmentalism etc recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.389" end="00:09:20.500" style="s2">there&#39;s something profoundly at odds</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.430" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">between us and nature what I think we</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.500" end="00:09:25.750" style="s2">can read from out of Hegel and out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:28.300" style="s2">hiding it is that nature must have its</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.750" end="00:09:31.389" style="s2">own essence it must be allowed to be in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.300" end="00:09:34.569" style="s2">its own terms in its own right and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.389" end="00:09:38.259" style="s2">some degree this means that nature is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.569" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">not fully accessible to us and that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.259" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">is it that comes back to we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">about you know is that does that switch</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:47.410" style="s2">the accessibility of nature does that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:51.310" style="s2">correspond to a switch in us what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.410" end="00:09:53.230" style="s2">is we so we have in a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.310" end="00:09:54.759" style="s2">egocentric in which we are seeing where</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.230" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking of everything of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.759" end="00:10:00.819" style="s2">in service to us and rather you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:02.259" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean sort of at an everyday</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.819" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">level but at a deeper level in the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.259" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">in which we might be in service so let</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:09.189" style="s2">me explain what I mean like Oh previous</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:11.319" style="s2">cultures saw their you know their soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.189" end="00:10:13.480" style="s2">their who they are a person who was</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.319" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">there ultimately their being in service</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.480" end="00:10:18.819" style="s2">to God right in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:21.819" style="s2">ontology the direction of service was on</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.819" end="00:10:24.490" style="s2">toast centric rather than egocentric so</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.819" end="00:10:26.259" style="s2">is that switching in the accessibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.490" end="00:10:28.930" style="s2">of nature does it also bring with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.259" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">like an inversion or a reversal of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.930" end="00:10:34.779" style="s2">orientation of service yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.779" end="00:10:40.630" style="s2">modernity as a whole I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">all of modernity is on that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.630" end="00:10:47.529" style="s2">what so the you know people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">acceleration ISM capital whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.529" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">want to call it what what this is there</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.839" style="s2">is a certain explosion that takes place</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:56.829" style="s2">in just in knowledge knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.839" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">production yes and and also a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.829" end="00:11:04.030" style="s2">explosion in terms of human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">and also in power I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.030" end="00:11:09.790" style="s2">mystic power our ability to exert power</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">on the earth it&#39;s tremendous now yes but</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.790" end="00:11:15.460" style="s2">every time we exert power we we deny</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">that there is something that remains</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.460" end="00:11:20.980" style="s2">hidden and concealed and I at push back</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:22.540" style="s2">that that&#39;ll that&#39;ll come to haunt us</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.980" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">right it&#39;s like the outline is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.540" end="00:11:26.170" style="s2">underworld that all of a sudden will</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:27.300" style="s2">flip and the sheer horror will begin to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.170" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">show itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.300" end="00:11:31.870" style="s2">modernity begins and you can call</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:33.460" style="s2">whatever you call this it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.870" end="00:11:36.520" style="s2">power an explosion of power and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.460" end="00:11:40.330" style="s2">intelligence yes and that explosion</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.520" end="00:11:41.650" style="s2">kicks off I would say when when the key</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.330" end="00:11:46.270" style="s2">loss is abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.650" end="00:11:49.090" style="s2">so teleology they can explicitly gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.270" end="00:11:52.630" style="s2">rid of the Telos yeah yes it was an</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.090" end="00:11:55.000" style="s2">impediment to the sciences for 2,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.630" end="00:11:56.770" style="s2">years so he blames every soul I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.000" end="00:11:58.840" style="s2">come up with the and everything explodes</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.770" end="00:12:01.420" style="s2">right so the call there&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.840" end="00:12:04.030" style="s2">book by Alexander query which is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.420" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">much read today which is from the closed</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.030" end="00:12:09.130" style="s2">world or from the cosmos to the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.630" style="s2">universe right yeah and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.130" end="00:12:12.550" style="s2">multiverse so you can see these</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.630" end="00:12:15.370" style="s2">explosions in all directions were</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.550" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">exploding to war see you know infinite</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.370" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">multiverse is but we&#39;re also exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:24.490" style="s2">exploding further and further down into</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:26.290" style="s2">the subatomic level and whatever levels</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.490" end="00:12:28.690" style="s2">so that explosion goes in all directions</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.290" end="00:12:33.030" style="s2">we can mash up everything and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.690" end="00:12:36.130" style="s2">think there&#39;s the day cup kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.030" end="00:12:38.850" style="s2">articulated is that the ego is at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.130" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">center of this self referential ego that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.850" end="00:12:47.020" style="s2">it simply is is holding on to itself and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.510" end="00:12:49.180" style="s2">only in fact is only on itself right</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.020" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">that the contact with the world is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:53.890" style="s2">central in the Aristotelian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:55.750" style="s2">has withdrawn into the cogito right kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.890" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">of fat exactly so it goes it totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.750" end="00:13:01.780" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly this right it&#39;s just but</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:03.430" style="s2">when you read the meditations right not</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.780" end="00:13:05.590" style="s2">an ottoman from from a scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.430" end="00:13:06.850" style="s2">perspective but simply as from a common</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.590" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2">sense for even from a common sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.850" end="00:13:10.840" style="s2">perspective you read it it&#39;s quite some</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:13.750" style="s2">of it is really violent right quite cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.840" end="00:13:15.450" style="s2">as I&#39;m looking outside I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.750" end="00:13:16.960" style="s2">if these people are real they could just</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.450" end="00:13:19.660" style="s2">what do I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.960" end="00:13:22.900" style="s2">and then only way that he can come back</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.970" end="00:13:47.650" style="s2">part of this huge huge inversion yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.250" end="00:13:49.870" style="s2">rather God rather than God representing</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.650" end="00:13:54.250" style="s2">the inexhaustible nosov the sacred death</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.470" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">inversion it&#39;s yes yeah okay yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.760" end="00:14:09.580" style="s2">good yes yes because when you look the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:12.700" style="s2">way we can look at this now and coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.580" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">back to quorus book from the close world</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.700" end="00:14:17.010" style="s2">to the infinite universe is something</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.100" end="00:14:19.530" style="s2">the book ends with an anecdote from</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.010" end="00:14:23.770" style="s2">Napoleon and Laplace</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.530" end="00:14:25.210" style="s2">yes % to Napoleon his model of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.770" end="00:14:27.790" style="s2">universe which is a pure like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.210" end="00:14:31.570" style="s2">clockwork yeah yeah Napoleon asks the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:33.970" style="s2">Laplace but where is God and he says I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.570" end="00:14:39.880" style="s2">no longer need this hypothesis need that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.970" end="00:14:42.400" style="s2">I bother and in is a hypothesis the mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.880" end="00:14:44.530" style="s2">of the clockwork in Descartes and in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.400" end="00:14:46.660" style="s2">bacon it&#39;s already there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.530" end="00:14:48.190" style="s2">simply that&#39;s perhaps also an issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.660" end="00:14:49.990" style="s2">first when he speaks of the death of God</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.190" end="00:14:53.500" style="s2">how were we capable of doing this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.990" end="00:14:55.960" style="s2">precisely because the inexpressible or</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.500" end="00:14:57.070" style="s2">the inexhaustible at the exuberance of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.960" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">the divine</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.070" end="00:15:00.610" style="s2">that&#39;s totally gone hiding its nest</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:02.200" style="s2">somewhere the god of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.610" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">I mean you think you point this out as</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.200" end="00:15:07.150" style="s2">well in in some of the lectures the god</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:08.890" style="s2">of metaphysics is not a God you can sing</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.150" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">and dance for yeah it&#39;s not a god you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.890" end="00:15:12.100" style="s2">fall down on your knees and all its like</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:15.730" style="s2">how&#39;s our soui</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.100" end="00:15:19.660" style="s2">that means the self causing cause it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.730" end="00:15:21.250" style="s2">just a hypothesis it&#39;s nothing that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.660" end="00:15:23.470" style="s2">could inspire there&#39;s nothing dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.250" end="00:15:26.950" style="s2">about this card well there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.470" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">nothing that will give you an operatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.950" end="00:15:31.390" style="s2">challenge to cause you to aspire to some</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">transformation and I mean it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.390" end="00:15:33.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple points I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:34.840" style="s2">here and see what you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.460" end="00:15:37.390" style="s2">one that seems to me to be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.840" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">culmination right of the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.390" end="00:15:42.070" style="s2">can do theology talk about God without</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:45.010" style="s2">have without having done to go any kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.070" end="00:15:47.260" style="s2">of deep transformation then the next one</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.010" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">is well just list these and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.260" end="00:15:51.250" style="s2">respond to them at length um you talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:53.260" style="s2">about this explosion but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.250" end="00:15:55.150" style="s2">inherently bound up with this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.260" end="00:15:56.590" style="s2">exploitation that we&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.150" end="00:15:58.210" style="s2">talking about so while we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.590" end="00:16:01.450" style="s2">quantitative increase there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.210" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">shallowing going on I was I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.450" end="00:16:04.980" style="s2">thinking when he was talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:07.420" style="s2">I was thinking about Hans critique his</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.980" end="00:16:09.940" style="s2">Krukow is that you don&#39;t need huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.420" end="00:16:11.800" style="s2">oppressive systems because we have we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.940" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">have an framing in which self</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.800" end="00:16:15.640" style="s2">exploitation is our fundamental way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:17.170" style="s2">being you know he talks about that whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.640" end="00:16:19.330" style="s2">achievement we just we&#39;re just working</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.170" end="00:16:21.370" style="s2">to work because things work because</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.330" end="00:16:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s how they were because technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.370" end="00:16:25.150" style="s2">works and it&#39;s all that sort of spinning</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.200" end="00:16:26.530" style="s2">and I thought that way I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.150" end="00:16:30.010" style="s2">was something you might want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.530" end="00:16:32.380" style="s2">about and then maybe gather that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.010" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">together back towards because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.380" end="00:16:36.330" style="s2">it&#39;s now looming on the horizon of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:38.260" style="s2">discussion which is the history of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.330" end="00:16:40.450" style="s2">metaphysics is the history of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.260" end="00:16:41.950" style="s2">where that doesn&#39;t mean the coming to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.450" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">the fore of a particular ideological</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.950" end="00:16:46.960" style="s2">position it means something more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:48.730" style="s2">this you know this modal emptying of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.960" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">capacity to get to the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.730" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">ourselves and the world things like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:57.670" style="s2">so what does all this refer three points</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.589" style="s2">you can play with have fun points I love</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.670" end="00:17:01.750" style="s2">to play with it because meaning first</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.589" end="00:17:04.270" style="s2">point was so we can talk about theology</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.750" end="00:17:07.060" style="s2">yeah yeah actually that&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.270" end="00:17:10.390" style="s2">been doing right yes yes very much so</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.060" end="00:17:13.240" style="s2">what I mean by this is the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.390" end="00:17:15.310" style="s2">works on all levels yes notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:17.680" style="s2">knowledge and an explosion of historical</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.310" end="00:17:20.829" style="s2">data yeah we get access to everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.680" end="00:17:23.709" style="s2">that&#39;s extremely odd because except</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.829" end="00:17:25.329" style="s2">while while we have this extreme access</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.709" end="00:17:27.699" style="s2">to all kinds of data points and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.329" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">information at the same time we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.699" end="00:17:34.170" style="s2">be cut off from something rather crucial</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:37.720" style="s2">which is genuine experience of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.170" end="00:17:39.960" style="s2">divine religion so we can look at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.720" end="00:17:41.920" style="s2">the different religions across all</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.960" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">civilizations we&#39;ll okay we can find</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.920" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:49.570" style="s2">it seems like we can less and less</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:51.400" style="s2">access to the divine a short story I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.570" end="00:17:54.820" style="s2">sometimes like to mention by Ian Foster</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.400" end="00:18:00.670" style="s2">is the machine stops which describe mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.820" end="00:18:03.400" style="s2">I think yeah people live on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.670" end="00:18:07.180" style="s2">and all they do is they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.400" end="00:18:10.600" style="s2">like us now online and and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.180" end="00:18:12.430" style="s2">about ideas the word idea is all over</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.600" end="00:18:15.030" style="s2">the place it&#39;s so they talk about ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.430" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">of all the for example music and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.030" end="00:18:20.440" style="s2">Aborigine Aboriginal Australian culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:22.420" style="s2">now all of this can be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.440" end="00:18:24.940" style="s2">and enlightening on some level but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.420" end="00:18:26.380" style="s2">never a it doesn&#39;t get you and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.940" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">why I think why he makes you know gives</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.380" end="00:18:29.290" style="s2">the metaphor of some people living on</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:31.330" style="s2">the ground it&#39;s because they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.290" end="00:18:33.700" style="s2">longer even on the earth and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.330" end="00:18:34.809" style="s2">allusion to Plato right there&#39;s a I get</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.700" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">to be an allusion to Plato&#39;s allegory</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.809" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">there exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:40.780" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s okay you know if I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">just I think that we live basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.780" end="00:18:46.450" style="s2">through the cave right you need to show</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">itself right that there&#39;s truth to what</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.450" end="00:18:52.360" style="s2">philosophy is trying to tell us and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:56.020" style="s2">we and the same counts of course for</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.360" end="00:18:59.110" style="s2">philosophy itself but we&#39;ve never had so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.020" end="00:18:59.650" style="s2">philosophy is it&#39;s not dying actually in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.110" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.650" end="00:19:03.130" style="s2">so yes it&#39;s be getting defunded all over</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:04.450" style="s2">the place but there are more</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.130" end="00:19:07.660" style="s2">philosophers probably now than ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.450" end="00:19:09.730" style="s2">before and there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.660" end="00:19:11.230" style="s2">historical engagement with any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.730" end="00:19:13.540" style="s2">philosophical school ever that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.230" end="00:19:15.490" style="s2">ever was but the question is is there a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.540" end="00:19:17.080" style="s2">genuine access to these experience this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.490" end="00:19:18.670" style="s2">is something Heidegger says again and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.080" end="00:19:20.440" style="s2">again is you can read all of this but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.670" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">you have to have made the experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.440" end="00:19:25.390" style="s2">even the experience is lacking then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:27.190" style="s2">kind of a simulacrum of the of the real</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.390" end="00:19:29.890" style="s2">thing and this was part of how those</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.190" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">critique - right I mean I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.890" end="00:19:33.940" style="s2">one of his main ideas sorry for</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:35.950" style="s2">interacting but I thought that was a yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.940" end="00:19:37.540" style="s2">what it&#39;s so and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.950" end="00:19:39.670" style="s2">I think hide again meetcha meetcha</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.540" end="00:19:42.970" style="s2">himself just by the way he lived</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.670" end="00:19:44.679" style="s2">I showed us that it needs if without it</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.260" end="00:21:33.409" style="s2">guess there&#39;s a point here that I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:35.990" style="s2">that should be emphasized right this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.409" end="00:21:37.820" style="s2">this isn&#39;t because some time here this</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.920" end="00:24:22.130" style="s2">thought was kind of a really profound</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:37.390" style="s2">that was sort of I thought it was one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.250" end="00:24:39.880" style="s2">the most brilliant things I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.390" end="00:24:41.260" style="s2">like no no we did I mean we don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.880" end="00:24:42.790" style="s2">not so much we don&#39;t he basically says</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I mean about you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.560" end="00:25:04.300" style="s2">about ourselves yeah that&#39;s how profound</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">it is yes so it&#39;s not coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.300" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">outside that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:14.650" style="s2">so the panopticon is us yes watching</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:17.080" style="s2">ourselves we&#39;re objectifying ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.650" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">an experience becomes real when we put</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.690" end="00:25:50.740" style="s2">wasn&#39;t recorded and we&#39;ll have other</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.060" end="00:25:53.500" style="s2">conversations but there wasn&#39;t we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.740" end="00:25:55.330" style="s2">I didn&#39;t email you anything no nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.500" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing it&#39;s just happens or it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.330" end="00:26:01.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen yes yeah and but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:03.430" style="s2">something about so experience and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.020" end="00:26:06.370" style="s2">looking at Hana this kind of this you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.430" end="00:26:08.350" style="s2">know this is a positive but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.370" end="00:26:10.360" style="s2">something something the self</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.350" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">exploitation is the self doing it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.360" end="00:26:15.700" style="s2">itself there&#39;s nothing coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:18.040" style="s2">outside this is why you know and framing</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:22.290" style="s2">yes that this is us doing it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.040" end="00:26:25.000" style="s2">it&#39;s decision so what is being being is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.290" end="00:26:28.360" style="s2">very simply ends clients that&#39;s Latin</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.000" end="00:26:32.550" style="s2">beings as beings being is the ass being</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.360" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">is just in the ass so beings show up as</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.550" end="00:26:36.140" style="s2">standing reserve that speak meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:38.120" style="s2">not some magical</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.140" end="00:26:40.310" style="s2">entity that&#39;s odd like in floating</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.120" end="00:26:43.490" style="s2">around doing something it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.310" end="00:26:45.620" style="s2">a hermeneutics that is historical that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.490" end="00:26:47.660" style="s2">is larger than us that overcomes us</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.620" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">we&#39;re born in throne as Heidegger would</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.660" end="00:26:53.690" style="s2">say thrown into it and then have to make</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:55.670" style="s2">sense but and and as for you read so we</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.690" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">cannot you know as a not like a toolbox</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.670" end="00:27:00.410" style="s2">we can reconfigure beings being itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:03.820" style="s2">at will but we can see that there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.410" end="00:27:06.590" style="s2">other dimensions other areas within</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.820" end="00:27:08.810" style="s2">being right within this interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.590" end="00:27:10.490" style="s2">of beings and all of a sudden it no</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.810" end="00:27:11.750" style="s2">longer just is a standing reserve but</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.490" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">there&#39;s that has to do I think with</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.750" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">accepting death and finitude because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.430" style="s2">this logic of self exploitation for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">sake of self exploitation etc etc what</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:25.610" style="s2">that always blinds out is limitation</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:28.700" style="s2">finitude exactly flames that oh I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.610" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">wanted to just again because I&#39;m ready</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.700" end="00:27:33.050" style="s2">because I&#39;m I want to be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.460" end="00:27:34.400" style="s2">the uptake of certain these terms I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.050" end="00:27:36.500" style="s2">think it&#39;s completely right to use the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.400" end="00:27:38.120" style="s2">word hermeneutic and interpretation but</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.500" end="00:27:40.280" style="s2">again you&#39;re not describing something</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.120" end="00:27:42.800" style="s2">that is just just or even focally</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.280" end="00:27:44.510" style="s2">cognitive it&#39;s not that kind I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.800" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a cognitive dimension to it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.510" end="00:27:48.290" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about this like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:51.320" style="s2">foramen UNIX is in well you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.290" end="00:27:54.470" style="s2">the the your the grammar of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.320" end="00:27:57.320" style="s2">existential moding yeah it&#39;s not well</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:27:58.520" style="s2">you know what it will well you&#39;re why</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.320" end="00:27:59.870" style="s2">would he meant there when he talked</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.520" end="00:28:01.460" style="s2">about hermeneutics is you know I sit</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.870" end="00:28:03.020" style="s2">back and I reflect and I think and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.460" end="00:28:04.340" style="s2">come up with and when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.020" end="00:28:06.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.340" end="00:28:09.620" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about well something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.680" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me my language and I use</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.620" end="00:28:13.160" style="s2">Dreyfus as a bridge from Heidegger to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:14.540" style="s2">this language I think this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.160" end="00:28:16.670" style="s2">gets down into the guts of our relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.540" end="00:28:18.860" style="s2">realization machinery now fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.670" end="00:28:21.050" style="s2">process by which you know our agency in</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.860" end="00:28:22.550" style="s2">the world and salience landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.050" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">what stands out and how it stands out</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.550" end="00:28:27.350" style="s2">for us as you said the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:29.720" style="s2">you know beings coming to be as</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.350" end="00:28:31.610" style="s2">particular beings I think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.720" end="00:28:33.410" style="s2">talking about that level I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:35.060" style="s2">well that I think and I think you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.410" end="00:28:36.560" style="s2">too we&#39;re talking about that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.060" end="00:28:38.660" style="s2">funding there hermeneutics that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.560" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">constitutes our agency not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.660" end="00:28:42.500" style="s2">hermeneutics that is out but after our</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:44.750" style="s2">agency is sort of established and we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.500" end="00:28:46.820" style="s2">some reflective stuff because that her</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.750" end="00:28:48.920" style="s2">yes because this is what hiding already</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.820" end="00:28:49.970" style="s2">points out in being in time as as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.920" end="00:28:53.570" style="s2">know is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.970" end="00:28:54.740" style="s2">a hermeneutic circle isn&#39;t sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.570" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:28:57.560" style="s2">writing something and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">reinterpreting some texts no the dot</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.560" end="00:29:02.900" style="s2">design itself right the openness to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:06.020" style="s2">being to that beings appear as something</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.900" end="00:29:07.730" style="s2">right but the tree can be a source of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.020" end="00:29:10.520" style="s2">energy the tree can also be the Tree of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.730" end="00:29:12.410" style="s2">Life in the Bible these are totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.520" end="00:29:13.790" style="s2">different on ontology almost that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.410" end="00:29:15.430" style="s2">hermeneutic circle is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.790" end="00:29:18.860" style="s2">design is in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.430" end="00:29:20.360" style="s2">exactly exactly exists and exists has to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.860" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">do with time and all of this comes in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.360" end="00:29:26.360" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s not is it&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:28.850" style="s2">deeper than just the reflective right</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.360" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">good what modernity wants us to do right</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.850" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what Descartes wants us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:34.840" style="s2">exactly I everything and put everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.080" end="00:29:39.170" style="s2">into doubt methodologically</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.840" end="00:29:41.180" style="s2">life at some absolute certainty and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.170" end="00:29:42.560" style="s2">is what Heidegger pulls the rug under</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.180" end="00:29:45.470" style="s2">from from the beginning that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.560" end="00:29:47.750" style="s2">pulls that away and says the only</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.470" end="00:29:51.620" style="s2">certainty das eine can have his death</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.750" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a bit of a you know brutal</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.620" end="00:29:59.420" style="s2">maybe but he I think so the cogito ergo</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">film which takes takes modernity on its</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.420" end="00:30:03.920" style="s2">trajectory it&#39;s counted behind ago and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:06.680" style="s2">he says so Mori bundles I am because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.920" end="00:30:10.970" style="s2">am towards my death and this being</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.680" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">towards this ultimate horizon gifts is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.970" end="00:30:16.300" style="s2">what then grants meaning because when</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.740" style="s2">you begin to see the finitude of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.300" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">anything but that&#39;s the word I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.740" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">pick up on yeah yeah so when people hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:25.790" style="s2">this they hear just the finality of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">death they don&#39;t hear the finitude</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.790" end="00:30:30.590" style="s2">of mortality and those aren&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:32.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not disconnected from each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.590" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">but they&#39;re you shouldn&#39;t reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.600" end="00:30:36.650" style="s2">latter to the former right the the fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:39.110" style="s2">that we&#39;re in the finitary predicament</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.650" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">as Chania talks about it is really</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.110" end="00:30:43.610" style="s2">really fundamental to the I mean I in</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:45.860" style="s2">fact argue this extensively that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.610" end="00:30:47.960" style="s2">fundamental to our capacity of making</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.860" end="00:30:50.690" style="s2">meaning at least meaning in life kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.960" end="00:30:52.100" style="s2">meaning that we don&#39;t have that if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.690" end="00:30:54.680" style="s2">weren&#39;t in the finicky finitary</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">predicament we wouldn&#39;t be cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.680" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">agents at all it&#39;s it&#39;s right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:01.720" style="s2">it&#39;s in the very guts of our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:06.370" style="s2">make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.720" end="00:31:10.120" style="s2">yes we couldn&#39;t simply because there</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.370" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2">there would be nothing to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.120" end="00:31:15.330" style="s2">death establishes this ultimate horizon</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:19.899" style="s2">and against which</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.330" end="00:31:23.590" style="s2">rise ins just light up and begin to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.899" end="00:31:26.470" style="s2">sense and this there&#39;s this this there</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.590" end="00:31:28.809" style="s2">is something the weird thing is to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.470" end="00:31:30.730" style="s2">across that it&#39;s it&#39;s not morbid it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.809" end="00:31:34.090" style="s2">not not mystic or anything like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.730" end="00:31:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to say that look look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.090" end="00:31:38.529" style="s2">wonderful moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.620" end="00:31:42.299" style="s2">that&#39;s just so a curse a red LED today</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.529" end="00:31:45.399" style="s2">is the pretty say yeah that just occurs</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.299" end="00:31:48.309" style="s2">but it also occurs because bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.399" end="00:31:51.370" style="s2">it is already it&#39;s it&#39;s its limitation</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.309" end="00:31:52.899" style="s2">its ending its it it will end this day</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.370" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">will end and then it becomes a memory</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.899" end="00:31:59.860" style="s2">but it&#39;s it it isn&#39;t nothing that who</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">would just extend out forever</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a new stance of standing</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:05.460" style="s2">now could have this kind of exuberance</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:07.929" style="s2">Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.460" end="00:32:10.750" style="s2">I tried to get into that when I brought</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.929" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">I tried to bring in in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.750" end="00:32:17.559" style="s2">lectures that Buddhist notion of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:20.440" style="s2">know the horror of immortality oh I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.559" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">to know you don&#39;t like a real challenge</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:25.029" style="s2">because it would just it would just it</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">would like I tend to think you know of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.029" end="00:32:29.379" style="s2">salience landscape almost topographical</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:31.720" style="s2">right and then if you stretched it out</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.379" end="00:32:32.980" style="s2">right you would sort of lose all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.720" end="00:32:35.799" style="s2">topography and you would get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.980" end="00:32:37.629" style="s2">absolute flatness of kind of an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.799" end="00:32:40.570" style="s2">nihilism because why would anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.629" end="00:32:43.450" style="s2">matter more than anything else why would</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.570" end="00:32:44.110" style="s2">you do one thing all of this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.450" end="00:32:49.960" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.110" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">all of it all of it goes away and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.960" end="00:32:55.269" style="s2">mean I wonder if there&#39;s a because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:57.580" style="s2">know how to get it and pick this up but</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.269" end="00:33:00.009" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a there seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.580" end="00:33:02.409" style="s2">little bit of a I might be over reading</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.009" end="00:33:04.450" style="s2">so some allusions until it towards this</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.409" end="00:33:07.000" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep complicity</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.450" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">between sort of the you know the project</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.000" end="00:33:12.549" style="s2">of immortality and and and and and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:15.140" style="s2">kind of forgetfulness that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.549" end="00:33:17.960" style="s2">about right there the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.140" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">well you know well this project is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:23.390" style="s2">ultimate project is for me to live</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:24.920" style="s2">forever and that right and so you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.390" end="00:33:26.600" style="s2">what I&#39;m suggesting I this is not a well</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.920" end="00:33:28.220" style="s2">work there thesis but it&#39;s we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.600" end="00:33:29.750" style="s2">here there&#39;s an idea here that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.220" end="00:33:31.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.750" end="00:33:34.400" style="s2">complicity between the immortality</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.820" end="00:33:35.900" style="s2">project and nihilism emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.400" end="00:33:37.820" style="s2">nihilism that&#39;s what I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.900" end="00:33:42.490" style="s2">absolutely I think it&#39;s yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.820" end="00:33:46.390" style="s2">that that&#39;s that that&#39;s more work more</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.490" end="00:33:48.679" style="s2">brainpower needs to go into that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.390" end="00:33:50.570" style="s2">suggestion that idea that trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.679" end="00:33:54.530" style="s2">because that&#39;s absolutely the case</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.570" end="00:33:58.160" style="s2">I think I what we&#39;re trying to find out</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.530" end="00:34:00.049" style="s2">why immortality and and increasing</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.160" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">nihilism of the crisis of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.049" end="00:34:08.090" style="s2">collapsing is there now why is that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:09.619" style="s2">could come at it simply from from from</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.090" end="00:34:12.590" style="s2">Hegel for example we could say you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.619" end="00:34:15.800" style="s2">life that is that doesn&#39;t face up to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.590" end="00:34:17.659" style="s2">death is just sheer immediacy your</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.800" end="00:34:19.879" style="s2">immediacy is that&#39;s excessive in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.659" end="00:34:22.280" style="s2">phenomenology sheer immediacy is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.879" end="00:34:23.629" style="s2">sheer givenness and once you live in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.280" end="00:34:25.669" style="s2">sheer givenness and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.629" end="00:34:28.609" style="s2">resistance is there&#39;s no opposition to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.669" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">you then everything becomes again flat</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.609" end="00:34:33.590" style="s2">right and Nietzsche says something goes</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:35.720" style="s2">because we&#39;re riffing off for you but so</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.590" end="00:34:38.359" style="s2">Nietzsche says the last man lives</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.720" end="00:34:44.990" style="s2">longest he threatens the earth so this</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.359" end="00:34:47.720" style="s2">idea of flattening oh yeah and life</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.990" end="00:34:51.530" style="s2">Hegel says the full life life that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.720" end="00:34:53.990" style="s2">breathes itself subsumes death and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:56.659" style="s2">strides through death because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.990" end="00:34:59.060" style="s2">negativity so without negativity you</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.659" end="00:35:01.400" style="s2">don&#39;t even live in sheer immediacy but</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.060" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2">immediacy must be mediated and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.400" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">immediately through negativity it you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:08.840" style="s2">can also say that education something we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:12.950" style="s2">both care about deeply very much nation</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.840" end="00:35:15.500" style="s2">is not something you can consume there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.950" end="00:35:17.510" style="s2">a struggle and struggle means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.500" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">something that that&#39;s resisting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.510" end="00:35:20.210" style="s2">something that you don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">understand that you are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.210" end="00:35:24.590" style="s2">negativity so you have to strive through</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.100" end="00:35:26.450" style="s2">what you don&#39;t know and then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.590" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">a place where you begin to know but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.450" end="00:35:28.970" style="s2">that&#39;s not something you can just</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">download into your brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.970" end="00:35:33.710" style="s2">because you know the advocates of of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:36.200" style="s2">transhumanism for example who want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.710" end="00:35:37.820" style="s2">live forever have digital itseif or that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.200" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">everything is just a given is like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.820" end="00:35:40.670" style="s2">matrix Oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.349" style="s2">neo do you do you know how to fight no</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.670" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">will just upload it to your brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.349" end="00:35:48.619" style="s2">um you can like that&#39;s that if there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:51.050" style="s2">no struggle there&#39;s no push back you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.619" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">won&#39;t would you learn how to walk yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.050" end="00:35:55.010" style="s2">you need to learn how to walk by getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">up and falling back down and getting up</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.010" end="00:36:00.980" style="s2">again and until it&#39;s if you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:03.560" style="s2">walk okay so there&#39;s two there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.980" end="00:36:05.090" style="s2">riff points to come out for that one is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.560" end="00:36:07.160" style="s2">because you know I&#39;m doing the work on</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.090" end="00:36:09.320" style="s2">the after Socrates project and we lost</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.160" end="00:36:11.510" style="s2">the role of the operatic right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.320" end="00:36:13.250" style="s2">lost the importance of aporia right</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.510" end="00:36:15.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the importance of aporia</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.250" end="00:36:19.099" style="s2">so that I think is points direct and how</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.710" end="00:36:21.320" style="s2">central that is to dialogic reasoning as</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.099" end="00:36:22.790" style="s2">opposed to mana logic reasoning because</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.320" end="00:36:24.500" style="s2">you know we sort of we keep doing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.790" end="00:36:26.300" style="s2">we sort of get to them and like we even</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.500" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">have these little momentary aporia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.300" end="00:36:32.660" style="s2">that there and then they get folded back</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:35.450" style="s2">in yeah and then well sorry I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.660" end="00:36:38.170" style="s2">lost my other point what oh jeez it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:41.390" style="s2">a good one too there was the a pyretic</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.170" end="00:36:43.550" style="s2">the loss of that and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.390" end="00:36:45.290" style="s2">think about something you said oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.550" end="00:36:49.099" style="s2">and then the decades that now I remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.290" end="00:36:50.810" style="s2">thank you um dis dis brings because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.099" end="00:36:53.180" style="s2">alluded to Tillich until it has that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.810" end="00:36:55.400" style="s2">idea right it&#39;s it&#39;s a hey Gillian but</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.180" end="00:36:57.830" style="s2">it&#39;s also posed to Gillian you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.400" end="00:37:00.080" style="s2">the God beyond the god of theism is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.830" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">God that always is taking on being back</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.080" end="00:37:07.730" style="s2">into himself right and that and that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:10.460" style="s2">I thought which is like III don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.730" end="00:37:12.680" style="s2">that people get how radical I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.460" end="00:37:15.349" style="s2">think the kyoto school and not they saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.680" end="00:37:17.750" style="s2">they got oh wow he this is really this</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.349" end="00:37:19.849" style="s2">is a really radical thing he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.750" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">he&#39;s proposing a deep kind of non-theism</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.849" end="00:37:28.150" style="s2">right because he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s saying i</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:31.010" style="s2">think right that we should give up a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.150" end="00:37:34.099" style="s2">perfectionist model of god that god is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.010" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">finished completeness right and that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.099" end="00:37:38.589" style="s2">should we should stop trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:41.850" style="s2">you know you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.589" end="00:37:44.600" style="s2">everlasting completeness</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.850" end="00:37:47.970" style="s2">perfection that that is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.600" end="00:37:49.080" style="s2">inappropriate framing of the divine you</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.970" end="00:37:50.460" style="s2">noted because he was dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.080" end="00:37:52.350" style="s2">demeaning crisis I mean that&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.460" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">the case and the courage to be and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.350" end="00:37:57.210" style="s2">was saying like we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">fundamentally break out of that way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.210" end="00:38:01.170" style="s2">thinking in a deep deep way so I give</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:02.790" style="s2">you sort of two things to play with</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.170" end="00:38:04.350" style="s2">there on that one we still have to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.790" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">back to the history of metaphysics as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.350" end="00:38:08.070" style="s2">history of Allen which kind of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.220" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.070" end="00:38:12.630" style="s2">so a Portilla yeah gratz a key notion</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.220" end="00:38:14.550" style="s2">and this is I think it was important</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.630" end="00:38:16.950" style="s2">just as an aside on hiding it hiding it</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.550" end="00:38:18.390" style="s2">is not deep I think doesn&#39;t I think of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.950" end="00:38:20.520" style="s2">these does not deconstruct does not want</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.390" end="00:38:23.060" style="s2">to get rid of metaphysics or our any of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.520" end="00:38:25.620" style="s2">the texts no it&#39;s just reading and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.060" end="00:38:27.840" style="s2">picking up on something that&#39;s lost in</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.620" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">the tradition yeah we have to do with</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.739" end="00:40:29.430" style="s2">might not articulate it technically as</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.349" end="00:41:35.269" style="s2">I was trying to also I was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.589" end="00:41:37.159" style="s2">you know there&#39;s people out there that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.269" end="00:41:38.989" style="s2">are doing exactly what you say they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:45.499" style="s2">they&#39;re responding to it again not</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.729" end="00:41:47.539" style="s2">primarily propositional II but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.499" end="00:41:50.029" style="s2">much more existentially pervasive and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.539" end="00:41:52.909" style="s2">profound since I also wanted to know it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.029" end="00:41:55.399" style="s2">because I see that like like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.909" end="00:41:57.919" style="s2">wrapping up Sarajevo Robbie&#39;s book on</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.399" end="00:42:02.149" style="s2">you know Socratic wisdom and platonic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.919" end="00:42:04.399" style="s2">knowledge and the role of aporia for</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.149" end="00:42:07.309" style="s2">waking people up for bringing them from</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.399" end="00:42:09.529" style="s2">making them sort of remember the being</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.309" end="00:42:10.909" style="s2">mode remember that they are the beings</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.529" end="00:42:13.039" style="s2">who be who&#39;s being as impressed should</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.909" end="00:42:14.749" style="s2">remember that they in addition to all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.039" end="00:42:16.669" style="s2">their knowings they have this they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.749" end="00:42:20.089" style="s2">an awareness of themselves as no words</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.669" end="00:42:24.979" style="s2">and like and this sort of profound right</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.089" end="00:42:27.439" style="s2">that that are you still there yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.979" end="00:42:30.259" style="s2">you cut up for a sec that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.439" end="00:42:32.299" style="s2">profound realization that we write that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.259" end="00:42:33.409" style="s2">that we have a well you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.299" end="00:42:35.509" style="s2">there seems to talk about it that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.409" end="00:42:37.939" style="s2">have a kind of responsibility that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.509" end="00:42:39.649" style="s2">other things we encounter don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.939" end="00:42:42.049" style="s2">because we are the beings whose being is</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.649" end="00:42:43.339" style="s2">in question yeah so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.049" end="00:42:45.169" style="s2">say I guess clumsily is I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.339" end="00:42:47.209" style="s2">say that what aporia does is wake you up</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.169" end="00:42:49.369" style="s2">to the fact that you are the being whose</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.209" end="00:42:53.449" style="s2">being is in question and that puts me</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.369" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">that means to me that it that&#39;s I did I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.449" end="00:42:56.629" style="s2">think there&#39;s a deep connection it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:42:58.339" style="s2">just happenstance or it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.629" end="00:43:00.679" style="s2">historical there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.339" end="00:43:04.699" style="s2">between aporia and dialogue alright</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.679" end="00:43:07.729" style="s2">because we are dialogue is a much more</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.699" end="00:43:10.489" style="s2">powerful way for us to bring ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.729" end="00:43:12.619" style="s2">into questioned right because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.489" end="00:43:14.149" style="s2">we can question and quest we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.619" end="00:43:17.649" style="s2">question each other and quest together</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.149" end="00:43:19.579" style="s2">beyond you know our sort of stable</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.649" end="00:43:22.010" style="s2">conceptualizations so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.579" end="00:43:24.830" style="s2">deep there&#39;s a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.010" end="00:43:27.860" style="s2">in Emporia like they I think they sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.830" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">of really need each other because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.860" end="00:43:32.060" style="s2">you see that right you&#39;ve sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:33.860" style="s2">Socratic conduction of aporia of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.060" end="00:43:35.600" style="s2">people have all of these they have this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.860" end="00:43:37.040" style="s2">machinery that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.600" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">throughout our conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:43.010" style="s2">protects them from waking up in you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:46.580" style="s2">in kind of a pernicious manner right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.010" end="00:43:48.920" style="s2">you right yeah exactly right and and uni</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.580" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">and one of the things that dialogue does</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.920" end="00:43:53.030" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m sort of riffing on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:54.920" style="s2">opposite of idea that hell is other</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.030" end="00:43:58.490" style="s2">people but other people are openings</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.920" end="00:44:00.290" style="s2">right go ahead go ahead I&#39;ve gotta you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.490" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">can you said kissed because that was can</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.290" end="00:44:07.940" style="s2">you say a bit more on on what stopping</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:09.470" style="s2">people to wake up I want to like I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.940" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">I think well part of it what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.470" end="00:44:17.060" style="s2">talking about yeah no and I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:19.400" style="s2">this long argument and Awakening about</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.060" end="00:44:21.830" style="s2">this deep historical cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.400" end="00:44:23.930" style="s2">grammar that kind of in frames us and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.830" end="00:44:26.780" style="s2">and when I do that in my mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.930" end="00:44:28.310" style="s2">thinking of by analogy right you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.780" end="00:44:30.590" style="s2">things like the nine dot problem where</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.310" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">we have a framing of the problem and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.590" end="00:44:35.000" style="s2">fundamentally yet it prevents us from</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">seeing what needs to be seen I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.000" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">it in that sense and so we yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.130" end="00:44:40.670" style="s2">kind of profound cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.140" end="00:44:43.430" style="s2">grammar and our way of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.670" end="00:44:45.710" style="s2">world and we get its monologic it&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.430" end="00:44:47.210" style="s2">exploitation itself speaking and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.710" end="00:44:49.340" style="s2">ultimately talking to myself because all</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.210" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">that I touches myself hajikko it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.340" end="00:44:56.210" style="s2">this yeah what dialogue can do if if</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:59.990" style="s2">it&#39;s deal logos and not just discourse</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.210" end="00:45:01.670" style="s2">yes it can induce aporia because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.990" end="00:45:03.500" style="s2">what the Socratic encounter is in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.670" end="00:45:05.630" style="s2">mind you get this person who comes in</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.500" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">looks like they&#39;re gonna do this course</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.630" end="00:45:09.710" style="s2">with you and then he goes aha</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:12.200" style="s2">right he does this thing where and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.710" end="00:45:14.360" style="s2">suddenly there&#39;s a pouria yeah wake up</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.200" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">to who it like who you wake up to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.360" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">aspirational challenge you wake up to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:18.710" style="s2">the fact that you are the being who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:20.360" style="s2">being is in question</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.500" end="00:47:19.220" style="s2">then then they wake up to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.390" end="00:47:21.020" style="s2">possibility of poetry because if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.220" end="00:47:23.059" style="s2">just have them start reading text it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.020" end="00:47:25.039" style="s2">just oh well you know what did the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.059" end="00:47:26.990" style="s2">author thing write what they do and oh</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.990" end="00:47:34.670" style="s2">clearly representing yeah but you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.930" end="00:47:36.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that there&#39;s something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.670" end="00:47:38.180" style="s2">something very profound you mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.170" end="00:47:40.539" style="s2">kind of funny because we&#39;re talking on</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.180" end="00:47:43.160" style="s2">the same kind of on the same plane right</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.539" end="00:47:45.109" style="s2">because it makes us laugh I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.160" end="00:47:46.730" style="s2">because what we&#39;re seeing is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.109" end="00:47:48.829" style="s2">there&#39;s no thought that goes into this</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.730" end="00:47:52.099" style="s2">and we can very quickly say like</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.829" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">so this is 18th century German poetry</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.099" end="00:47:55.969" style="s2">this must therefore mean blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:57.289" style="s2">blah and this was written in 20th</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.969" end="00:47:57.829" style="s2">century America this must mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.289" end="00:47:59.989" style="s2">bah-bah-bah</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.550" end="00:51:02.360" style="s2">extend the conversation with with God</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.980" end="00:51:03.980" style="s2">because I think he would really like</p>
