<p begin="00:00:00.170" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">hello welcome to psychology 230</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.140" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">personality and its transformations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">called that because there are two things</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">that you have to take into account when</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about personality and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">one of those is how personality stays</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">the same across time and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">what gives you your identity and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:41.010" style="s2">allows you to identify other people and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">then also how personality changes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.010" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">going to discuss both those things from</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">a very large number of perspectives to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.270" style="s2">find out all the information that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">need for the course all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.270" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">is type my name into a browser and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">you&#39;ll get my home page which is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">page that you see here on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">there&#39;s a table of contents that says</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">current courses and then up here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">also a table of contents that lists the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">courses and this one&#39;s this one and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">this is the introductory page here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">then you can get to the course page like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">this I don&#39;t really like blackboard so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use this instead so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:29.000" style="s2">easy to get to and everything you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">to know about the course should be here</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.000" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">so we&#39;ll start with the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">straightforward things the first is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two sources for reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">in this course and one is a paperback</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:45.799" style="s2">book which is called introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">personality and its transformations</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.799" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">they&#39;re both their chapters that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">selected from a classic personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">textbook that does a very good job of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">covering classic personality theorists</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">although not such a good job of covering</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">more recent work the book was published</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:08.600" style="s2">in 1982 Freud hasn&#39;t changed much since</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:11.390" style="s2">night</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.600" end="00:02:14.420" style="s2">- but there has been an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.390" end="00:02:16.220" style="s2">personality research and so that brings</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.420" end="00:02:17.480" style="s2">us to the second source of readings and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.220" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">the second source of readings is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.480" end="00:02:22.490" style="s2">actually this web page so if you go down</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:24.950" style="s2">the web page to lecture topics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.490" end="00:02:28.580" style="s2">readings you&#39;ll see in the third column</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:31.220" style="s2">a whole sequence of papers now you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.580" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">to pay attention to this lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.220" end="00:02:35.060" style="s2">reading table more than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.080" end="00:02:37.310" style="s2">because it tells you what&#39;s going on for</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.060" end="00:02:39.830" style="s2">the for the duration of the course and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.310" end="00:02:42.320" style="s2">tell you what the lectures are so today</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.830" end="00:02:43.640" style="s2">for example it&#39;s January 7th and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.320" end="00:02:51.770" style="s2">we&#39;re doing an introduction and overview</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.640" end="00:02:59.720" style="s2">maybe I can make that little bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.770" end="00:03:01.550" style="s2">next week on Thursday we start with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.720" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">reading it&#39;s called free forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.550" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">meaning in the management of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:06.830" style="s2">and all you have to do is to get that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">reading is click on it and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.830" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">that reading which is a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:14.630" style="s2">straightforward process</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:18.460" style="s2">um you would probably like the lectures</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.630" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">better if you do the readings beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.460" end="00:03:23.660" style="s2">that&#39;s it isn&#39;t necessary you can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:25.400" style="s2">this any way you want but you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.660" end="00:03:30.290" style="s2">more out of the course I think if you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.400" end="00:03:35.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s two TAS for this course</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.290" end="00:03:37.550" style="s2">they&#39;re also listed here one is Vanessa</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.600" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">Ghosh and the other is Victor Swift</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.550" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2">their availability is listed here so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:48.380" style="s2">Vanessa is available from 4:45 to 5:45</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.620" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">on Thursdays and Victor his mate is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.380" end="00:03:54.380" style="s2">available from 315 to 450 Tuesdays their</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:56.180" style="s2">office offices are listed there as are</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.380" end="00:04:00.020" style="s2">their email addresses so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.180" end="00:04:04.190" style="s2">get in touch with them my office hours</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.020" end="00:04:06.320" style="s2">are Wednesday from 4:15 to 5:45 now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.190" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">way I handle that is outside my office</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.320" end="00:04:10.850" style="s2">which is office four zero four six which</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">is also listed there there are a number</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.850" end="00:04:14.360" style="s2">of sign-up sheets that I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:16.280" style="s2">post on the wall do that right after</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.360" end="00:04:18.140" style="s2">class as they&#39;re printed out there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.280" end="00:04:20.730" style="s2">number of sign-up sheets that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.140" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">listed on the wall and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.730" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">your best bet is just to take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">15-minute slot don&#39;t take a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:30.990" style="s2">of them because the student-to-teacher</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">ratio in this class is obviously quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.990" end="00:04:36.420" style="s2">high and so just take one for now if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:38.640" style="s2">would and maybe if you have a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.420" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">with me you can check back later to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.640" end="00:04:42.870" style="s2">if there&#39;s time for another one I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">like to have more time than that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.870" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">available but 90 minutes is what I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">spare this semester</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">so anyways they&#39;ll be up today now in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.330" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">terms of the mechanics of the course</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:02.190" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty straightforward there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:05.670" style="s2">tricks there&#39;s two midterms</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.190" end="00:05:11.010" style="s2">the first one is February 6th and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.670" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">second one is March 13th and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.010" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">also a final and the midterm in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">finals essentially make up 75% of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:22.140" style="s2">course it&#39;s actually seventy seven point</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.660" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">five percent of the course but and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.140" end="00:05:27.320" style="s2">there&#39;s two writing assignments the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">first writing assignment is an essay and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.320" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">the essay has a number of different due</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">dates so if you&#39;re on the website you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:38.670" style="s2">can go to writing assignments and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:40.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll see all these different topics</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.670" end="00:05:43.470" style="s2">that you could choose from now if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.350" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">click on one of these you get to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.470" end="00:05:47.460" style="s2">little signup sheet here and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">can put in your name and your email</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.460" end="00:05:54.600" style="s2">address and that signs you up for that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:56.430" style="s2">topic and as you can see 10 people can</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.600" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">sign up for each topic so if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.430" end="00:06:02.450" style="s2">love with a particular topic then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.830" end="00:06:02.450" style="s2">should sign up sooner rather than later</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.350" end="00:06:09.630" style="s2">the due dates fall a little after the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.530" end="00:06:12.270" style="s2">course content that&#39;s related to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.630" end="00:06:16.230" style="s2">topic so it&#39;ll be the next class after</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.270" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">the lectures on that topic and and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.230" end="00:06:21.270" style="s2">spread them out across the year so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:23.640" style="s2">the TAS don&#39;t die of frustration and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.270" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">that you guys can get your essays back</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.640" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">with a reasonable degree of promptness</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:32.729" style="s2">hopefully within a week although let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:42.539" style="s2">say two weeks which seems reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.729" end="00:06:47.699" style="s2">so the second writing exercise which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.539" end="00:06:51.150" style="s2">worth 7.5% the essays worth 15% is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.699" end="00:06:53.879" style="s2">personality self analysis it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.150" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">suite of programs that I designed called</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.879" end="00:07:08.430" style="s2">the self authoring suite and I can show</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">you those and it&#39;s at self authoring</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.430" end="00:07:17.490" style="s2">calm and I&#39;ll show you this video at</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:19.289" style="s2">some point but for now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.490" end="00:07:21.509" style="s2">information here on these programs but</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.289" end="00:07:23.789" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you code such a username and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.509" end="00:07:27.899" style="s2">password so that you can complete these</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.789" end="00:07:29.969" style="s2">and what you&#39;ll be asked to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.899" end="00:07:33.300" style="s2">complete an exercise that&#39;s based on a</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.910" end="00:09:04.079" style="s2">good in that it&#39;ll help you develop a</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.519" end="00:09:21.089" style="s2">conscientious that&#39;s a good predictor of</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:28.380" style="s2">do and they seem to suffer shame and</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">associated with great wing political</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.660" end="00:09:47.579" style="s2">views and when it&#39;s extreme it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">get repressive and so the point of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.579" end="00:09:52.200" style="s2">this is that there are five traits and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:54.450" style="s2">they have positive and negative aspects</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:57.240" style="s2">especially at the extremes and these</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.450" end="00:09:59.250" style="s2">programs are set up first of all so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.240" end="00:10:01.860" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a series of adjectives that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.250" end="00:10:03.870" style="s2">are universal descriptors so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.860" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">basically a small set of adjectives 100</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.870" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">to kind of cover each dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">personality with a reasonable degree of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:12.899" style="s2">comprehensiveness then you&#39;ll be asked</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:14.670" style="s2">to pick which ones you think are</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.899" end="00:10:17.790" style="s2">particularly relevant to you and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.670" end="00:10:20.700" style="s2">you&#39;ll be asked to narrow that final</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.790" end="00:10:22.620" style="s2">list in one half of the exercise a list</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.700" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">that represents your virtues and then in</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.620" end="00:10:27.480" style="s2">the other half of the exercise a list</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:30.270" style="s2">that represents your fault then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.480" end="00:10:33.300" style="s2">be asked to describe a time when that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.270" end="00:10:35.160" style="s2">virtue played a positive role for you or</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.300" end="00:10:39.149" style="s2">when that fault interferes with you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.160" end="00:10:41.070" style="s2">then you&#39;ll be asked to describe how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.149" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">might capitalize on that virtue in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.070" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">future or perhaps bring that fall under</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:50.540" style="s2">control in the future and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:54.690" style="s2">that writing exercises of this sort are</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:57.779" style="s2">very practically useful they have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.690" end="00:10:58.259" style="s2">variety of positive effects one of which</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.330" end="00:15:07.570" style="s2">syllabus you also have to do two</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.570" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">words by the way but don&#39;t let that fool</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.370" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">you because a 750 word essay can be very</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:17.200" style="s2">difficult to write the essay and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">this personality analysis now the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.200" end="00:15:22.780" style="s2">personality analysis all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">is show it to the TA to show them that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.780" end="00:15:25.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve completed</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.660" end="00:15:27.530" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want to know what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.250" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">wrote down and we want to encourage you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.530" end="00:15:31.280" style="s2">to write down things that you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:33.200" style="s2">like to write down that are likely</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.280" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">private unless you want to broadcast to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.200" end="00:15:38.090" style="s2">the faults on Facebook which I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:40.760" style="s2">you do after you complete exercise so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.090" end="00:15:43.310" style="s2">the reason I want you to do that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.760" end="00:15:45.350" style="s2">was three reasons right one is well it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.310" end="00:15:46.670" style="s2">will familiarize you more with standard</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.350" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">models of personality because you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.670" end="00:15:49.520" style="s2">have to apply them to yourself and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:52.400" style="s2">then you&#39;ll understand yourself better</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.520" end="00:15:55.310" style="s2">too so that&#39;s a good thing and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.400" end="00:15:56.810" style="s2">also a quasi clinical intervention and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.310" end="00:15:58.520" style="s2">some of you because you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.810" end="00:16:00.200" style="s2">course are no doubt interested in</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.520" end="00:16:02.060" style="s2">clinical psychology so this will give</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.200" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">you the flavor of the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.060" end="00:16:06.770" style="s2">that a clinical psychologist might do</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:08.930" style="s2">except a computer is doing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.770" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">which which turns out to be fine</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.930" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">people will actually often tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:20.450" style="s2">computers things that they wouldn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:22.760" style="s2">people yeah anyways and the third reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.450" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">is that well it should be good for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.760" end="00:16:26.780" style="s2">and you know the education should be</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">good for you that&#39;s actually the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.780" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">of Education right it&#39;s supposed to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:32.540" style="s2">you more healthy mentally and physically</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:35.030" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to make you more</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.540" end="00:16:37.370" style="s2">productive and so that&#39;s what education</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.030" end="00:16:41.270" style="s2">is for and that&#39;s what this class is for</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.370" end="00:16:44.300" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming at so then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.270" end="00:16:47.540" style="s2">there&#39;s two exams two midterms 25% each</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.300" end="00:16:50.570" style="s2">approximately there multiple-choice</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.540" end="00:16:52.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll post sample questions so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.570" end="00:16:55.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll know what they&#39;re like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.010" end="00:16:57.080" style="s2">not tricky people get worried about</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.400" end="00:16:59.390" style="s2">exams and rightfully so but these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.080" end="00:17:01.070" style="s2">tricky exams if you do the readings and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.390" end="00:17:02.960" style="s2">you come to the class the probability is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.070" end="00:17:06.320" style="s2">quite high that you&#39;ll do at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.960" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">reasonably well I don&#39;t ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.320" end="00:17:10.460" style="s2">memorize dates and that sort of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:11.840" style="s2">try to keep it at a conceptual level and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.460" end="00:17:14.810" style="s2">so the questions on the multiple-choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.840" end="00:17:16.520" style="s2">tests are usually conceptual questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.810" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">where I try to get you to take something</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.520" end="00:17:20.510" style="s2">that you&#39;ve learned it read and to apply</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:21.500" style="s2">it to the solving of a problem even</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.510" end="00:17:23.660" style="s2">though they&#39;re in standard</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.500" end="00:17:25.580" style="s2">multiple-choice format there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.660" end="00:17:27.200" style="s2">usually not a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.580" end="00:17:30.890" style="s2">questions so you&#39;ll be able to complete</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.200" end="00:17:35.480" style="s2">the exams in the time allows without any</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.890" end="00:17:38.060" style="s2">trouble so now let&#39;s see I should tell</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.480" end="00:17:40.340" style="s2">you guys who should take this course and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.060" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">who shouldn&#39;t take it because you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.340" end="00:17:46.370" style="s2">to know that since it&#39;s your first day</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">and so this course has two or three</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.370" end="00:17:52.370" style="s2">aspects one aspect is is scientific that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:55.430" style="s2">really occupies the last half of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.370" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">course I would say in the purely</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.430" end="00:18:01.670" style="s2">scientific part of the course with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">purely research oriented element of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.670" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">course so the first part of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.770" end="00:18:08.420" style="s2">to because science has morning science</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">is more than mere testing of hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.420" end="00:18:13.490" style="s2">anyways the second half of the course</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">deals essentially with trade theory and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.490" end="00:18:19.340" style="s2">with psycho biology so what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:22.580" style="s2">is to tell you about the the basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:24.910" style="s2">dimensions of human variability and also</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.580" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">how those are represented in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.910" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">so that you can make a connection and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">and the body so that you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:34.670" style="s2">connection between the theories and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:36.830" style="s2">biological and cognitive substrates and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:39.260" style="s2">that sort of a unifying account so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.830" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be interested not if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.260" end="00:18:44.420" style="s2">want to take this course and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.250" style="s2">and have it go well for you so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.420" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">some psycho metrics that&#39;s the science</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.250" end="00:18:49.580" style="s2">of measurement there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.750" end="00:18:52.730" style="s2">statistics there&#39;s a reasonable amount</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.580" end="00:18:56.780" style="s2">of neuropsychology and some of its</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">complex some of it isn&#39;t but I try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.780" end="00:19:03.380" style="s2">only pick things that I try to only pick</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">things to discuss with you that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.380" end="00:19:06.920" style="s2">relevant at three levels to the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve looked them to be personally</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.920" end="00:19:10.520" style="s2">relevant so that they tell you something</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:12.650" style="s2">about yourself I want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.520" end="00:19:14.930" style="s2">intellectually relevant but I also want</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.650" end="00:19:16.790" style="s2">them to be culturally relevant so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.930" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">not all when you walk away from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.790" end="00:19:20.060" style="s2">study not only do you know something</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">more about you and your friends but</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.060" end="00:19:25.210" style="s2">hopefully you&#39;re a better functioning</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">creature in the broader social milieu so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.210" end="00:19:30.560" style="s2">so everything is picked to that end</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">including the psychobiological there</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.560" end="00:19:35.960" style="s2">neuropsychological material in the trait</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.270" end="00:19:41.510" style="s2">material there&#39;s a fairly hemp heavy</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.960" end="00:19:44.120" style="s2">emphasis on clinical issues the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.510" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">half of the course deals with classic</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.120" end="00:19:47.960" style="s2">theorists of personality</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:50.150" style="s2">all the classic personality theorists</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.960" end="00:19:52.580" style="s2">were clinicians now the U of T not</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.150" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">present doesn&#39;t have a clinical program</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.580" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">although they&#39;re starting it up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:58.130" style="s2">Scarborough but down here it&#39;s a gorge</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.930" style="s2">there&#39;s not many clinicians I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.130" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">probably the only one I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.930" end="00:20:07.130" style="s2">they let me in and the the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:09.710" style="s2">clinician that the emphasis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.130" end="00:20:12.350" style="s2">clinicians is too full right one is well</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.710" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">who is the person or what is the person</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.350" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">but more importantly who could the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:19.670" style="s2">person be or what should they be and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:21.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange thing about people</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.670" end="00:20:23.810" style="s2">right I mean if you have a cat you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.860" end="00:20:26.660" style="s2">really sit around thinking what could</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.810" end="00:20:28.670" style="s2">this cat be because it&#39;s a cat and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.660" end="00:20:30.380" style="s2">know if it has an offspring they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.670" end="00:20:32.780" style="s2">gonna be cats and in a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.380" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">they&#39;re still gonna be just cats but</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.780" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">people well we&#39;re strange in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">are virtually overcome incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">and we&#39;re not only what we are but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:47.090" style="s2">also what we could be and in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.660" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">especially for people of your age you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.090" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">way more what you could be that what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:54.410" style="s2">are and so focusing on what you could be</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:55.910" style="s2">is an extremely important thing to do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.410" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.910" end="00:21:00.290" style="s2">research and some of its associated with</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">the writing exercises that I&#39;ve told you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.290" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">about earlier that if you make efforts</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">to define who you could be and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:09.140" style="s2">in a way that you find interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:11.450" style="s2">because you might as well shape yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">into something that you want to be that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.450" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">that increases the efficiency with which</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:20.120" style="s2">we work substantially it also makes you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">a better person by reasonable measures</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.120" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">of better which sort of needs happier</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:26.090" style="s2">than healthier you know more acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">or at least less repulsive to other</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.090" end="00:21:32.450" style="s2">people so the clinical material is very</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:35.510" style="s2">useful for that and the clinical</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.450" end="00:21:38.030" style="s2">material is grounded in observation so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.510" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like ethology ethology is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.030" end="00:21:42.260" style="s2">the study of animal behavior but not in</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:44.230" style="s2">the labs observational study one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.260" end="00:21:47.450" style="s2">clinical stuff has this observation</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.230" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">quality to it it&#39;s heavily influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.450" end="00:21:52.220" style="s2">philosophy if you&#39;re not interested</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">ideas this is a bad course for you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.220" end="00:21:57.410" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a course that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:21:59.090" style="s2">private early concentrates on ideas I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.410" end="00:22:01.160" style="s2">want them to have practical utility</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.090" end="00:22:03.680" style="s2">because why not you might as well put</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.160" end="00:22:07.190" style="s2">constraints on them but but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.680" end="00:22:09.950" style="s2">fundamental focuses ideas and so when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.190" end="00:22:11.960" style="s2">discussed the clinical material clinical</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.950" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">personality material will discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.960" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">philosophical background of that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.820" end="00:22:18.470" style="s2">do the same thing when we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:21.170" style="s2">cycle biological material so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.470" end="00:22:23.960" style="s2">decide if you&#39;re not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.170" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">philosophical ideas then this is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.960" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">course if you&#39;re going to be stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:33.080" style="s2">it with those sorts of things half the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:34.700" style="s2">time so and there&#39;s some old there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.080" end="00:22:36.770" style="s2">some elements of the course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.700" end="00:22:38.510" style="s2">almost straight philosophy because some</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.770" end="00:22:41.390" style="s2">of the clinical schools especially those</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.510" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">that were developed in the 1950s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.390" end="00:22:46.660" style="s2">existential psychology are very tightly</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.340" style="s2">associated with fields of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.660" end="00:22:52.250" style="s2">existentialism and phenomenology in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.340" end="00:22:54.920" style="s2">case and so I think that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.250" end="00:22:56.420" style="s2">is very much worth learning because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.920" end="00:22:58.430" style="s2">part of the history of ideas and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.420" end="00:23:00.860" style="s2">should know something about it it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.430" end="00:23:02.150" style="s2">very interesting it&#39;s very useful to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.860" end="00:23:03.470" style="s2">know something about if you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.150" end="00:23:04.940" style="s2">a clinical psychologist because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.470" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">should know a fair bit about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.940" end="00:23:07.550" style="s2">things if you&#39;re gonna be a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.230" end="00:23:10.940" style="s2">psychologist but even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.550" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">interested in researching Sciences half</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.940" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">pipe hypothesis testing but the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.900" style="s2">half is hypothesis generation that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:20.360" style="s2">most important out you got to think up</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.900" end="00:23:21.770" style="s2">an idea before you can test it and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.360" end="00:23:23.510" style="s2">know most of what you&#39;ll learn in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.770" end="00:23:25.700" style="s2">methods class has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.510" end="00:23:27.890" style="s2">generating research hypotheses they just</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.700" end="00:23:30.260" style="s2">tell you to do that first generate your</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.890" end="00:23:32.780" style="s2">research hypotheses it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.260" end="00:23:33.910" style="s2">that&#39;s the big problem right there the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.780" end="00:23:36.980" style="s2">resident is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.910" end="00:23:40.130" style="s2">just brined it through this process and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.980" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">the way you generate research hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.130" end="00:23:45.170" style="s2">is by knowing something and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:47.390" style="s2">to learn a lot in order to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.170" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">research hypothesis that well first that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.390" end="00:23:52.309" style="s2">someone hasn&#39;t already else hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">already thought of and disproved which</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.309" end="00:23:55.580" style="s2">is highly probable it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:57.260" style="s2">depressing too</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.580" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">yeah the more and more knowledge because</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.260" end="00:24:02.150" style="s2">what you find is that it everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:09.320" style="s2">already thought of everything and most</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.150" end="00:24:13.340" style="s2">your ideas are stupid so yeah so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.320" end="00:24:15.620" style="s2">now let&#39;s see oh yes here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.340" end="00:24:19.700" style="s2">reason not to take the course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.620" end="00:24:23.000" style="s2">lot of reading and there&#39;s less reading</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.700" end="00:24:24.710" style="s2">there was last year I took out one paper</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.000" end="00:24:26.150" style="s2">that was too hard I think it was too</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.710" end="00:24:29.300" style="s2">hard for people even though it was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.150" end="00:24:33.650" style="s2">great paper and but my right left the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.300" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">rest of the day and so if you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.650" end="00:24:38.690" style="s2">for a course with the light reading load</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2">this isn&#39;t that course because this has</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.690" end="00:24:43.280" style="s2">a heavy reading load now on the upside</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:45.410" style="s2">for your essays and don&#39;t require you to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.280" end="00:24:46.940" style="s2">read outside the course you couldn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.410" end="00:24:49.309" style="s2">the material that&#39;s in the course to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.940" end="00:24:51.559" style="s2">write the essay so it&#39;s self-contained</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.309" end="00:24:56.059" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of reading and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.559" end="00:24:57.950" style="s2">not easy reading and partly because a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.059" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">lot of it is original papers all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.950" end="00:25:03.620" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s listed on the web is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.920" end="00:25:06.250" style="s2">original papers and then the textbook -</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.620" end="00:25:08.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a tough textbook it&#39;s mostly text</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.250" end="00:25:10.010" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a lot of pictures in it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.630" end="00:25:12.230" style="s2">it has no stories at all about</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.010" end="00:25:13.910" style="s2">celebrities I think that&#39;s the only text</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.230" end="00:25:18.800" style="s2">left it doesn&#39;t have stories about</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.910" end="00:25:22.220" style="s2">celebrities in it so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.800" end="00:25:25.390" style="s2">taking a tough course semester and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.220" end="00:25:29.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of time to read then</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.390" end="00:25:30.770" style="s2">well this isn&#39;t of course like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.240" end="00:25:33.290" style="s2">of course where there&#39;s an awful lot to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.770" end="00:25:35.420" style="s2">read and the thing about the reading too</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.290" end="00:25:38.570" style="s2">is that you have to think about it you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.420" end="00:25:41.390" style="s2">know like how fast you can read</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.570" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">something seems to be a function of how</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.390" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">complicated the words are that would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:46.429" style="s2">function one</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">but the second function seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.429" end="00:25:51.409" style="s2">something like how many ideas there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:53.960" style="s2">per paragraph or maybe per page there</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.409" end="00:25:56.570" style="s2">are lots of ideas per paragraph in these</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.960" end="00:25:58.490" style="s2">readings that&#39;s why I picked them so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.570" end="00:26:00.350" style="s2">can&#39;t just zip through them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.490" end="00:26:02.330" style="s2">think about them well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.350" end="00:26:04.070" style="s2">thing if you do read them you&#39;ll know a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.330" end="00:26:05.270" style="s2">lot more at the end of the class then</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.070" end="00:26:07.100" style="s2">you did it at the beginning of the class</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.270" end="00:26:09.500" style="s2">and you&#39;ll find that that knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.100" end="00:26:12.110" style="s2">extremely useful I truly believe that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.500" end="00:26:13.700" style="s2">this knowledge can change your life well</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.110" end="00:26:15.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what it was generated for right</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.700" end="00:26:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s generated by clinicians and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.380" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">personality psychologists that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.510" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">they&#39;re out there to do and they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:26.419" style="s2">there to take unrevealed potential that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:29.110" style="s2">could be anything into hammer it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.419" end="00:26:33.950" style="s2">shape it into something that&#39;s hard and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.110" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">pure and solid and you have to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.950" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">of reading and writing but they need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:41.270" style="s2">get to a point like that but it really</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:44.779" style="s2">beats the hell of mucking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.270" end="00:26:46.490" style="s2">murk and unfortunately that&#39;s how many</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.779" end="00:26:49.399" style="s2">people live and I&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.490" end="00:26:51.169" style="s2">consequences of that and if you spend</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.399" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">the next 30 years like that you will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.169" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">oh by the time you&#39;re 50 and so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:27:01.549" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t recommend that so it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.770" end="00:27:04.279" style="s2">doing the work it&#39;s really worth so</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.549" end="00:27:10.680" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look now well first I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.279" end="00:27:15.030" style="s2">ask you if there are any questions yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.680" end="00:27:17.430" style="s2">oh yeah I&#39;ll get the username and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.030" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">passwords up to you pretty quick so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.430" end="00:27:22.770" style="s2">just have to make contact with the guy</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:30.470" style="s2">designed it with to get the code Seoul</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.770" end="00:27:32.820" style="s2">won&#39;t be long I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.470" end="00:27:35.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the plan some of you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.820" end="00:27:37.650" style="s2">purchased it perhaps okay so it appears</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.580" end="00:27:40.050" style="s2">that you can&#39;t there&#39;s also maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.650" end="00:27:42.030" style="s2">old texts from write slag floating about</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.050" end="00:27:43.770" style="s2">you can use those too so you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.030" end="00:27:45.780" style="s2">good deal on them you can often get them</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.770" end="00:27:49.230" style="s2">secondhand on Amazon for like 20 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.780" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">if you lure the old text is fine except</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.230" end="00:27:53.310" style="s2">that it has more chapters in it but if</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:54.840" style="s2">you pay attention careful attention to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.310" end="00:27:56.310" style="s2">the syllabus that won&#39;t be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.840" end="00:27:57.660" style="s2">because all the chapters are numbered</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.310" end="00:27:59.550" style="s2">and all you have to is match the number</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.660" end="00:28:04.460" style="s2">on the syllabus to the number in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.550" end="00:28:04.460" style="s2">book so other questions okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.990" end="00:28:18.750" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look at what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:21.560" style="s2">to learn about lecture 2 so you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.750" end="00:28:25.950" style="s2">think of human knowledge in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.560" end="00:28:27.540" style="s2">just branching into two components you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.950" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">can think of those two components as</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.540" end="00:28:31.410" style="s2">knowledge about the subjective world and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:33.530" style="s2">knowledge about the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.410" end="00:28:35.940" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.530" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">the other way you can think about it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.940" end="00:28:42.150" style="s2">knowledge about what things are and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">knowledge about what to do now most of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.150" end="00:28:45.900" style="s2">what you learn in the university is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.500" end="00:28:47.970" style="s2">knowledge about what things are but</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.900" end="00:28:49.470" style="s2">that&#39;s only half of what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.970" end="00:28:52.220" style="s2">know because you really need to know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.470" end="00:28:54.780" style="s2">what what you should go about and do</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.220" end="00:28:55.980" style="s2">this is a real problem for human beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.780" end="00:28:57.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re always trying to fit</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:28:59.070" style="s2">having to think up what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.240" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">doing next and like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.070" end="00:29:03.270" style="s2">fundamental question of life which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:04.680" style="s2">well what should I do next or what</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.270" end="00:29:06.780" style="s2">should i do tomorrow or what should I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.680" end="00:29:08.430" style="s2">next week or next month or next year</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.780" end="00:29:10.260" style="s2">because that&#39;s another problem about</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.430" end="00:29:12.390" style="s2">being human is that not only do we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.260" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">to figure out what to do next but we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.390" end="00:29:17.260" style="s2">also see the future or multiple futures</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:19.930" style="s2">even and then we have to determine</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.260" end="00:29:21.670" style="s2">those futures could be and how to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.930" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">others that we don&#39;t want to have come</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.670" end="00:29:25.630" style="s2">into existence at all and then how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:27.640" style="s2">configure our behavior so that as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.630" end="00:29:30.010" style="s2">navigate through the potential futures</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.640" end="00:29:31.750" style="s2">we land up more or less somewhere we</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.010" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">want and not somewhere we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:36.280" style="s2">want and so that&#39;s a real problem what</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s an existential problem in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.280" end="00:29:41.890" style="s2">what that means is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:45.730" style="s2">knowledge about the subjective and about</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.890" end="00:29:48.220" style="s2">the behavior it&#39;s part of potential how</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.730" end="00:29:50.110" style="s2">do you unravel yourself across time now</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.220" end="00:29:52.270" style="s2">it&#39;s proved very difficult for human</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.110" end="00:29:52.750" style="s2">beings to formalize that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.270" end="00:29:54.910" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.750" end="00:29:56.380" style="s2">now we formalize scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.910" end="00:29:58.810" style="s2">which is more knowledge about what</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.380" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">things are and about the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.810" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">the scientific method especially the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:05.080" style="s2">research method for analyzes our</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:07.720" style="s2">knowledge about the objective world and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.080" end="00:30:09.850" style="s2">about what it&#39;s made of but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.720" end="00:30:12.430" style="s2">give us much insight into what to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.850" end="00:30:14.800" style="s2">about that all it seems to do actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.430" end="00:30:17.410" style="s2">is increase our power to do things but</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.800" end="00:30:19.210" style="s2">not necessarily to inform us as to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.410" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">direction in which that power should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.210" end="00:30:23.860" style="s2">exerted and you don&#39;t really have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.570" style="s2">look any farther than the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.860" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">if you want historical proof of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.570" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">because as people got more and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.240" style="s2">powerful so that we could sit in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">lovely classroom it will be warm and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.240" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">cozy well it&#39;s terrible outside</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:40.680" style="s2">we also learned how to kill each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:44.140" style="s2">with unprecedented gusto and potency and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.680" end="00:30:49.090" style="s2">so science has enabled us on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.140" end="00:30:52.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it is good or bad about</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.090" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">the behavioral side there&#39;s a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.780" end="00:30:57.460" style="s2">of knowledge and it&#39;s an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:31:00.070" style="s2">tradition and it&#39;s grounded in forms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.460" end="00:31:01.780" style="s2">knowledge that are likely tens of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.070" end="00:31:03.700" style="s2">thousands of years old or maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.780" end="00:31:04.660" style="s2">older than that and those are forms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.700" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">knowledge that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.660" end="00:31:10.770" style="s2">mythological or religious and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:13.620" style="s2">that I start with those is first of all</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.770" end="00:31:17.410" style="s2">religious systems are in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.620" end="00:31:19.330" style="s2">theories of personality and there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.410" end="00:31:21.310" style="s2">tight associations between certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.330" end="00:31:24.070" style="s2">religions of certain fields of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.310" end="00:31:26.290" style="s2">psychology so Judaism has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.070" end="00:31:28.450" style="s2">identified fairly heavily with Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.290" end="00:31:29.410" style="s2">Christianity with Carl Jung&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.450" end="00:31:32.440" style="s2">also with Carl</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.410" end="00:31:35.260" style="s2">this was actually a seminarian and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.440" end="00:31:37.870" style="s2">of the ideas about what a person could</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.260" end="00:31:40.450" style="s2">be so these are ideas about the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.870" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">are derived from religious and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.450" end="00:31:44.160" style="s2">mythological substrates cuz you they</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:46.570" style="s2">have to be derived from somewhere right</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.160" end="00:31:48.520" style="s2">and so you think well how do people get</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.570" end="00:31:50.200" style="s2">their ideas about what&#39;s possible or</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.520" end="00:31:52.300" style="s2">what should be part of it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.200" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">storytelling that&#39;s why you go to movies</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.300" end="00:31:56.920" style="s2">right you go there to see what people</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:58.690" style="s2">could be and you enact all those people</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.920" end="00:32:00.370" style="s2">on the screen with your bodies well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.690" end="00:32:02.230" style="s2">happening and you have a little neural</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.370" end="00:32:05.040" style="s2">system that does that so it puts you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.230" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">rank the action it&#39;s an amazing ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.040" end="00:32:09.220" style="s2">amazing human ability and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:10.870" style="s2">we&#39;re so attracted to that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.220" end="00:32:12.910" style="s2">is because we want to know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.870" end="00:32:15.790" style="s2">with ourselves and there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:18.280" style="s2">body of very complex information that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.790" end="00:32:20.410" style="s2">pertains to that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.280" end="00:32:23.140" style="s2">Carl Jung said was that what were the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.410" end="00:32:24.730" style="s2">things he believed was that that form of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.140" end="00:32:27.280" style="s2">knowledge have developed quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.730" end="00:32:28.870" style="s2">explicitly up to about the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.280" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">Renaissance or rowboats at the time of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.870" end="00:32:33.220" style="s2">bacon and Descartes who founded and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:35.050" style="s2">Galileo who basically founded the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.220" end="00:32:36.940" style="s2">scientific method and then we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.050" end="00:32:38.800" style="s2">start developing that kind of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.940" end="00:32:40.770" style="s2">and the knowledge of the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.800" end="00:32:44.020" style="s2">just leapt ahead and in like</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.770" end="00:32:45.970" style="s2">exponentially and so that&#39;s left us with</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.020" end="00:32:48.160" style="s2">the same moral intelligence we have in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.970" end="00:32:51.130" style="s2">the 1700s but with 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.160" end="00:32:53.620" style="s2">technology not necessarily a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.130" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">so part of what we&#39;re doing in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.620" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">is rescuing the past you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:02.670" style="s2">other class sometimes I show Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">the movie how many of you seen Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.670" end="00:33:07.870" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s like the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:10.750" style="s2">animated movie ever made seconds I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.870" end="00:33:13.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a Lion King there&#39;s one scene in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.750" end="00:33:15.160" style="s2">Pinocchio and where Pinocchio rescues is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.480" end="00:33:17.800" style="s2">farther from a whale you may remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.160" end="00:33:19.690" style="s2">that you may notice that you watch that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.800" end="00:33:20.980" style="s2">and that was perfectly fine as far as</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.690" end="00:33:23.500" style="s2">you were concerned in fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">could watch a puppet swim with a cricket</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.500" end="00:33:29.950" style="s2">to the bottom of the ocean and rescue</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:31.480" style="s2">his father from a whale slain okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.950" end="00:33:33.640" style="s2">the first thing you might think about is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.480" end="00:33:35.530" style="s2">how in the world could you sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.640" end="00:33:37.150" style="s2">swallow that and not even know she</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.530" end="00:33:39.280" style="s2">noticed notice that you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.150" end="00:33:41.400" style="s2">something as absurd and bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.280" end="00:33:44.230" style="s2">any ritual you could possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.400" end="00:33:46.780" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s partly because we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.230" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">attracted to narrative and narratives</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.780" end="00:33:50.710" style="s2">have structured narratives or about</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.750" style="s2">behavior and they have a deep structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.710" end="00:33:55.630" style="s2">and they have a deep symbolic structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.750" end="00:33:57.370" style="s2">so for example the whale in Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.630" end="00:33:59.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just any ordinary way over</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.370" end="00:34:01.930" style="s2">because if you remember it also breathed</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.320" end="00:34:05.500" style="s2">smoke and fire it&#39;s a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.930" end="00:34:07.810" style="s2">behavior for a whale and not maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.500" end="00:34:10.659" style="s2">a whale that strange and that made it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.810" end="00:34:12.280" style="s2">dragon and so partly what that meant was</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.659" end="00:34:14.980" style="s2">that Pinocchio was rescuing his father</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.280" end="00:34:17.890" style="s2">from a dragon that&#39;s a very old story in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.980" end="00:34:20.169" style="s2">fact that story is the oldest story that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.890" end="00:34:21.400" style="s2">we have in written form it&#39;s a variant</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.169" end="00:34:25.740" style="s2">of a story that was told by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.400" end="00:34:28.360" style="s2">Mesopotamians about 5,000 years ago so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.740" end="00:34:31.090" style="s2">part of that story means when you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.360" end="00:34:33.070" style="s2">rescue your father well from what well</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:35.110" style="s2">from the murky chaos in which your</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.070" end="00:34:38.710" style="s2">culture is embedded you know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.110" end="00:34:41.980" style="s2">are all inheritors of rich cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.710" end="00:34:44.950" style="s2">traditions those are just words those</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.980" end="00:34:47.560" style="s2">cultural traditions orient you they keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.950" end="00:34:49.630" style="s2">you sane and if they&#39;re desiccated and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.560" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">broken up and dead in archaic and lying</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.630" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">in the bottom of the chaos then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:54.850" style="s2">better get them back out of there</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">because without of them you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.850" end="00:35:01.870" style="s2">live shallow and difficult lives and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:04.090" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad idea so starting with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.870" end="00:35:06.910" style="s2">historical perspectives we can situate</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.090" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">ourselves in maybe some hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.910" end="00:35:12.670" style="s2">thousands of years of history maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:17.260" style="s2">longer I can tell you in one manner when</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.670" end="00:35:20.260" style="s2">it&#39;d be longer it turns out that part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.260" end="00:35:22.030" style="s2">the reason that we can see so well with</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.260" end="00:35:24.580" style="s2">which we can human beings can really see</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.030" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">well way better than almost any other</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.580" end="00:35:28.600" style="s2">animal except hunting birds hunting</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:32.020" style="s2">birds can see better than us but other</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.600" end="00:35:34.750" style="s2">than that it&#39;s us and that&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.020" end="00:35:37.570" style="s2">rare among mammals and particularly rare</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.750" end="00:35:40.540" style="s2">among primates so you might ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.570" end="00:35:42.070" style="s2">well why can we see so well well it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.540" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">turns out that part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.070" end="00:35:47.320" style="s2">that we call evolved with predatory</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:49.270" style="s2">snakes so predatory snakes are newer</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.320" end="00:35:50.589" style="s2">than lizards by the way even though he</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.270" end="00:35:54.500" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.589" end="00:35:56.089" style="s2">dan there&#39;s a woman at UCLA Dean Glynn</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.500" end="00:35:57.859" style="s2">is Bell who was thinking why didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.089" end="00:35:59.450" style="s2">people see so well and so she wavered</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.859" end="00:36:01.220" style="s2">she had the snake detection theory</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.450" end="00:36:02.990" style="s2">because she worked with primates she</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.220" end="00:36:04.820" style="s2">knew they could really see the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.990" end="00:36:06.470" style="s2">camouflage patterns that snake hats</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.820" end="00:36:07.670" style="s2">things have an emotion that they make</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.470" end="00:36:09.470" style="s2">they&#39;re really good at detecting that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.670" end="00:36:12.020" style="s2">Plus human beings are very afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.470" end="00:36:14.180" style="s2">snakes innately plus if you take</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.020" end="00:36:15.890" style="s2">chimpanzees who&#39;ve never seen a snake</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.180" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">and you throw a rubber snake in their</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.890" end="00:36:19.670" style="s2">cage assuming they&#39;re in a cage then</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.260" style="s2">they jump to the top of the cage and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.670" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">because they&#39;re not happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.260" end="00:36:25.130" style="s2">snake but then they look at it and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:27.980" style="s2">if they&#39;re out in the jungle juggling</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.130" end="00:36:29.720" style="s2">around and they see a baby snake then</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.980" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2">they have a specific sort of pride they</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.720" end="00:36:34.820" style="s2">mate and they&#39;ll stand there for like</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:36.230" style="s2">nine hours watching a big snake making</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.820" end="00:36:37.579" style="s2">this noise and all the other chimps</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.230" end="00:36:40.780" style="s2">depending on how are afraid they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.579" end="00:36:42.859" style="s2">also come and look at the snake and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.780" end="00:36:44.660" style="s2">yeah because they want to know what that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.859" end="00:36:46.130" style="s2">snakes up to and that&#39;s what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.660" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2">know - we want to know what the snakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.130" end="00:36:51.109" style="s2">are up to that&#39;s for sure and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.200" end="00:36:53.329" style="s2">circuit that we developed to detect</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.109" end="00:36:55.099" style="s2">snakes the visual circuit is partly what</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.329" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">gives us such tremendous acuity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.099" end="00:36:59.109" style="s2">mission part of the way Isabel figured</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:01.700" style="s2">that out was by correlating primate</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.109" end="00:37:03.740" style="s2">visual acuity with the prick and its</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.700" end="00:37:06.260" style="s2">development over evolutionary time with</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.740" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">the prevalence of predatory snakes in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.260" end="00:37:09.079" style="s2">that geographical region and she found</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.690" style="s2">that there was a very high correlation</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.079" end="00:37:14.030" style="s2">so we can see sharply partly because</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.690" end="00:37:16.760" style="s2">we&#39;re always looking for snakes and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.030" end="00:37:19.970" style="s2">know that pile of undone homework in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.760" end="00:37:21.140" style="s2">your in your in your room that snakes as</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.970" end="00:37:23.150" style="s2">far as the part of your brain that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.140" end="00:37:26.359" style="s2">develop to deal with snakes is conserved</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.150" end="00:37:28.280" style="s2">and so you know if you leave a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.359" end="00:37:31.369" style="s2">things I&#39;m done around you then all</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.280" end="00:37:34.339" style="s2">you&#39;ve got is snakes and you&#39;re their</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.369" end="00:37:36.619" style="s2">target and so that&#39;s no way to live and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.339" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">so that whale down there at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.619" end="00:37:40.579" style="s2">the ocean that&#39;s kind of a variant of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">snake it&#39;s a dragon even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.579" end="00:37:45.050" style="s2">whale breathes fire right so let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:46.670" style="s2">it the Dragons and that&#39;s what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.050" end="00:37:48.710" style="s2">the idea that you have to rescue</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.670" end="00:37:51.109" style="s2">something from the dragon it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.710" end="00:37:52.520" style="s2">unbelievably old story and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.109" end="00:37:54.200" style="s2">partly what we&#39;re gonna be doing at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.520" end="00:37:57.260" style="s2">beginning of this course we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.200" end="00:37:58.069" style="s2">going way back into the murk and mark of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.260" end="00:38:00.890" style="s2">prehistory</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.069" end="00:38:03.830" style="s2">trying to understand what the hell we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.890" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">been up to for the last 60 million years</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.830" end="00:38:08.900" style="s2">is that&#39;s when our tree-dwelling</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:12.020" style="s2">ancestors first really started to deal</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:13.910" style="s2">with predatory snakes and my suspicions</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.020" end="00:38:16.040" style="s2">are that you&#39;re all evolved from one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:17.570" style="s2">those little tree dwelling rats the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.040" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">first one who figured out that if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.570" end="00:38:23.240" style="s2">drop the snake a stick on a snake it</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">would probably run away so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.240" end="00:38:30.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing for 60 million years</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:35.570" style="s2">throwing sticks at snakes so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.290" end="00:38:38.660" style="s2">first lecture and you&#39;ll see why when</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.570" end="00:38:41.720" style="s2">you do the reading white this is broadly</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.660" end="00:38:43.580" style="s2">relevant because it also accounts at</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.720" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">least in part for the human tendency to</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:50.710" style="s2">because it turns out that we use the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:54.140" style="s2">same circuit that we would use to handle</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.710" end="00:38:56.300" style="s2">predatory reptiles let&#39;s say we use that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.140" end="00:38:58.520" style="s2">circuit to first process people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.300" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">strange to us and it makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.520" end="00:39:01.700" style="s2">people who are strange to us who come</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.270" end="00:40:19.609" style="s2">and that brings us closer to the present</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">than say 60 million years ago it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.609" end="00:40:23.869" style="s2">like fifty thousand years ago there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:26.690" style="s2">shamanic traditions all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.869" end="00:40:30.890" style="s2">and the shaman has been a the precursor</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:39.859" style="s2">man of culture and he&#39;s sort of a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.589" end="00:40:42.109" style="s2">and a scientist and a priest all wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.859" end="00:40:44.060" style="s2">up into one thing and he&#39;s often the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.109" end="00:40:46.910" style="s2">person who&#39;s in charge of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.060" end="00:40:50.060" style="s2">many in many shamanic societies the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.910" end="00:40:52.700" style="s2">shaman has a vocabulary vocabulary that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.060" end="00:40:54.830" style="s2">vastly exceeds that of his peers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.700" end="00:40:57.140" style="s2">that&#39;s because he&#39;s been taught it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.830" end="00:40:59.990" style="s2">his initiatory process so that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.140" end="00:41:04.940" style="s2">culture within which that particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.990" end="00:41:06.589" style="s2">people survives can be transmitted down</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.940" end="00:41:08.300" style="s2">the generations with very little error</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.589" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">people can remember things that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.300" end="00:41:12.950" style="s2">transmitted verbally and preliterate</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:15.619" style="s2">cultures with unbelievable accuracy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.950" end="00:41:18.020" style="s2">then the shamanic initiation is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.619" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">intricate initiation as well are very</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.020" end="00:41:23.980" style="s2">interesting processes because they</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:26.930" style="s2">involve they involve death and rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.980" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">and death and rebirth is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.930" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">equivalent to change so here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:34.220" style="s2">to think about so if there&#39;s a mosquito</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:37.099" style="s2">and it wants to make another mosquito it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.220" end="00:41:40.700" style="s2">basically lays 10,000 eggs right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.099" end="00:41:43.670" style="s2">then all those eggs hatching 9999 of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.700" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">those little mosquitoes die and that one</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.670" end="00:41:48.050" style="s2">mosquito makes it in lays another 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:49.570" style="s2">days so it&#39;s pretty costly reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.050" end="00:41:52.520" style="s2">strategy right but so the way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.570" end="00:41:55.190" style="s2">mosquito works is that it knows that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.520" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">world is chaotic and dangerous and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.190" end="00:41:59.330" style="s2">has no idea how to survive in that so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:01.190" style="s2">just makes a whole pile of mosquitoes</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.330" end="00:42:02.900" style="s2">and it hopes that one of them will sneak</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.190" end="00:42:04.520" style="s2">through and each of those mosquitoes is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.900" end="00:42:07.160" style="s2">a tiny bit different from each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.520" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">mosquito in terms of time and place and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.160" end="00:42:12.020" style="s2">also genetic structure and maybe one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.570" style="s2">got some little advantage that allows it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.020" end="00:42:19.310" style="s2">to survive but it&#39;s costly right</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.570" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">it&#39;s 99999 to one otherwise we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.310" end="00:42:25.290" style="s2">covered with mosquitoes so so the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.660" end="00:42:26.580" style="s2">the mosquito deals with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.290" end="00:42:28.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.580" end="00:42:30.420" style="s2">it&#39;s by producing waters of mosquitoes</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.440" end="00:42:32.790" style="s2">but the way people figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.420" end="00:42:38.280" style="s2">going on is by producing lots of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.790" end="00:42:40.950" style="s2">and ideas are the relationship of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.280" end="00:42:44.460" style="s2">to you and the external world is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.950" end="00:42:46.410" style="s2">same as the relationship of animals to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.460" end="00:42:46.920" style="s2">the environment so there&#39;s a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.410" end="00:42:49.590" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.920" end="00:42:52.500" style="s2">Alfred North Whitehead who said human</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.590" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">beings evolved to let their ideas die</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.500" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">instead of them now that&#39;s a smart way</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">of thinking because it means that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:03.060" style="s2">can parse off a little some personality</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:05.220" style="s2">of yourself maybe it&#39;s angry sub</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.060" end="00:43:07.740" style="s2">personality or seven subpersonality or</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.220" end="00:43:09.840" style="s2">an entertainer is then forward you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.740" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">know the earth exactly ideas they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.840" end="00:43:13.620" style="s2">more like little spirits that are partly</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">you they&#39;re kind of stupid because</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.620" end="00:43:18.060" style="s2">they&#39;ve only got one direction but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s still variants of you and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.060" end="00:43:21.180" style="s2">you can present one of those to someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:22.950" style="s2">which you might do if you&#39;re dating</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.180" end="00:43:25.470" style="s2">someone who do you want to assuming you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.950" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">still do that if you&#39;re dating someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.470" end="00:43:28.920" style="s2">and you want to impress them maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:30.630" style="s2">spin off some little variant of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.920" end="00:43:33.660" style="s2">that you think is very attractive</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.630" end="00:43:35.190" style="s2">probably won&#39;t work I don&#39;t work and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.660" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work well then you can get</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.190" end="00:43:38.550" style="s2">all heartbroken and let it die and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.640" style="s2">maybe the next one you spin off will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.550" end="00:43:43.890" style="s2">a little more you know together and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.640" end="00:43:47.100" style="s2">that&#39;s how people progress they progress</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.890" end="00:43:48.930" style="s2">like dying and coming back to life at</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.100" end="00:43:50.700" style="s2">different levels say I mean maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.930" end="00:43:52.530" style="s2">just taking some little ratty mistake</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.700" end="00:43:54.750" style="s2">and so you can let it go and you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.530" end="00:43:57.090" style="s2">ashamed momentarily and it&#39;s only a</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.090" end="00:44:00.900" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s your whole damn personality</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.010" end="00:44:02.370" style="s2">that has to go you know when that</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.680" end="00:44:22.470" style="s2">you&#39;ll actually die but if you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.960" end="00:46:22.470" style="s2">changes and you know the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.470" end="00:46:25.260" style="s2">changes can live in a lot more places</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.470" end="00:46:28.290" style="s2">and so that&#39;s worth thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.260" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">but the cost is well when you change you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.290" end="00:46:32.550" style="s2">die a little bit and that&#39;s painful or</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:36.120" style="s2">maybe you die a lot and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.550" end="00:46:39.150" style="s2">painful so if you ever wonder why people</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.120" end="00:46:41.370" style="s2">don&#39;t change that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.150" end="00:46:44.190" style="s2">then we the next section is on</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.370" end="00:46:45.270" style="s2">constructivism we&#39;re gonna talk mostly</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.190" end="00:46:53.940" style="s2">about the essays</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.270" end="00:46:56.010" style="s2">developmental psychologist I like Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.940" end="00:46:58.470" style="s2">a lot because BJ had an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.010" end="00:47:00.710" style="s2">question is which is it&#39;s not a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.470" end="00:47:02.910" style="s2">question or an environmental question</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.710" end="00:47:04.140" style="s2">you know you might think those are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.910" end="00:47:06.150" style="s2">only two kinds of questions there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.140" end="00:47:11.670" style="s2">when you think about it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.150" end="00:47:15.420" style="s2">that here&#39;s why it&#39;s not clear to what</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.670" end="00:47:17.430" style="s2">degree you&#39;re specified by your genes so</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.420" end="00:47:19.860" style="s2">here&#39;s one possibility so let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.430" end="00:47:23.820" style="s2">it coated in your genetic structure our</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.860" end="00:47:27.000" style="s2">whole variety of potential use like who</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.820" end="00:47:29.070" style="s2">knows how many oh the potential used</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.000" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">that the entire history of mankind has</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.070" end="00:47:32.369" style="s2">been able to weave into their genetic</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">structure they&#39;re all sitting down there</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.369" end="00:47:38.220" style="s2">it coded in your genes and then that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:40.350" style="s2">very complex structure that&#39;s rife with</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.220" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">potential pops up into a particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.350" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">environment and then it interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:46.110" style="s2">that environment like a program</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:48.840" style="s2">interacts with the computer and gathers</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.110" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">information of one form or another that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.840" end="00:47:52.859" style="s2">takes that information and the material</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:55.260" style="s2">that it interprets and builds the real</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.859" end="00:47:57.240" style="s2">you out of them and that&#39;s what Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.260" end="00:48:01.050" style="s2">was stunned he was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.240" end="00:48:03.240" style="s2">how is a child go about taking itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.050" end="00:48:06.450" style="s2">from you know this thing that just lays</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.240" end="00:48:08.520" style="s2">there squats basically to something</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.450" end="00:48:10.230" style="s2">that&#39;s you know you go on YouTube but</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.520" end="00:48:12.090" style="s2">you see what people can do what human</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.230" end="00:48:16.380" style="s2">beings can do it&#39;s plenty unbelievable I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.090" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">mean we&#39;re so ridiculously versatile</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.380" end="00:48:21.109" style="s2">people can do things that are just</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:23.700" style="s2">impossible in every dimension</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.109" end="00:48:26.130" style="s2">intellectually physically spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:28.130" style="s2">they can even eat hot dogs that a rate</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.130" end="00:48:32.099" style="s2">that you can hardly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.130" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">we&#39;re very variable and Piaget was very</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.099" end="00:48:36.479" style="s2">interested in trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:38.609" style="s2">all of that embodied variability to come</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.479" end="00:48:40.349" style="s2">out of this little package of potential</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.609" end="00:48:41.099" style="s2">at the beginning of life it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.349" end="00:48:43.199" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.099" end="00:48:46.650" style="s2">so that&#39;s constructivism how does the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.199" end="00:48:49.829" style="s2">individual construct him or herself from</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.650" end="00:48:52.890" style="s2">nothing in some ways from birth forward</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.829" end="00:48:54.630" style="s2">and so Piaget especially his discussion</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.890" end="00:48:56.699" style="s2">of isn&#39;t developed it&#39;s sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:48:58.109" style="s2">analysis of the unfolding of a human</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.699" end="00:49:00.209" style="s2">being it because people were to do one</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.109" end="00:49:01.499" style="s2">full till you know because babies when</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.209" end="00:49:07.289" style="s2">they&#39;re born don&#39;t crunch it up like</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.499" end="00:49:10.859" style="s2">this you know get going and that was Phe</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.289" end="00:49:13.170" style="s2">is concerned so so that&#39;s that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.859" end="00:49:14.130" style="s2">and then we go from there to depth</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.170" end="00:49:15.779" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.130" end="00:49:23.369" style="s2">you might think about that Morris</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.779" end="00:49:25.049" style="s2">psychoanalysis now people have people</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.369" end="00:49:27.539" style="s2">aren&#39;t very happy generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.049" end="00:49:30.029" style="s2">about psychoanalytic theory especially</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.539" end="00:49:32.219" style="s2">if their research oriented but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.029" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">variety of reasons for that and one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.219" end="00:49:35.939" style="s2">them is they don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:39.479" style="s2">it that would be the first reason people</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.939" end="00:49:41.069" style="s2">are often tempted to denigrate anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.479" end="00:49:42.599" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.069" end="00:49:45.150" style="s2">quite hard to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.599" end="00:49:50.119" style="s2">psychoanalytic thinking it&#39;s in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.150" end="00:49:52.109" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard and the other thing about</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.119" end="00:49:54.269" style="s2">scientists and research scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.109" end="00:49:56.039" style="s2">engaged into psychological work is</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.269" end="00:49:58.109" style="s2">they&#39;re actually usually fairly mentally</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.039" end="00:49:59.999" style="s2">healthy you know at least they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.109" end="00:50:01.349" style="s2">healthy enough to be scientists which</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.999" end="00:50:02.429" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got to be pretty healthy</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.349" end="00:50:04.229" style="s2">to be a scientist to go to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.429" end="00:50:05.759" style="s2">disciplined what if you get up and go to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.229" end="00:50:07.679" style="s2">work every day you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.759" end="00:50:10.650" style="s2">think about complex things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.679" end="00:50:13.229" style="s2">be very orderly and persistent you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.650" end="00:50:16.410" style="s2">and so if there&#39;s a lot of demand on you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.229" end="00:50:18.089" style="s2">if you&#39;re a scientific researcher so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.410" end="00:50:19.559" style="s2">promis scientific researches they hang</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.089" end="00:50:21.509" style="s2">around with other scientific researches</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.559" end="00:50:23.699" style="s2">then they think that&#39;s what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.509" end="00:50:26.130" style="s2">are like and human beings are nothing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.699" end="00:50:28.709" style="s2">like scientific researchers there are a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.130" end="00:50:31.739" style="s2">tiny minority of the population there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.709" end="00:50:33.900" style="s2">bizarres like albino Buffalo and to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.739" end="00:50:36.359" style="s2">think of them as representative of human</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.900" end="00:50:39.059" style="s2">is insane first of all most people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.359" end="00:50:41.809" style="s2">IQs in the 99th percentile so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.059" end="00:50:44.490" style="s2">why bother even thinking about them</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.809" end="00:50:46.529" style="s2">normal human beings are very weird</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.490" end="00:50:49.500" style="s2">especially the ones that don&#39;t function</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.529" end="00:50:51.690" style="s2">well and not functioning well is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.500" end="00:50:53.819" style="s2">bottomless pit though that&#39;s what hell</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.690" end="00:50:55.559" style="s2">is important by the way it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.819" end="00:50:57.869" style="s2">functionally well it&#39;s a bottomless pit</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.559" end="00:50:59.549" style="s2">and if you&#39;re dealing with people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.869" end="00:51:01.380" style="s2">aren&#39;t functioning well one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.549" end="00:51:04.650" style="s2">mysterious things is how they can take a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.380" end="00:51:06.630" style="s2">situation is god-awful beyond your worst</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.650" end="00:51:09.480" style="s2">imaginings and then think up three or</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:11.220" style="s2">four creative ways to make it worse and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.480" end="00:51:13.529" style="s2">if you&#39;re dealing with someone like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.220" end="00:51:14.910" style="s2">and you do if you&#39;re a clinician if</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.529" end="00:51:17.270" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with someone like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.910" end="00:51:20.309" style="s2">good luck with your behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.270" end="00:51:22.589" style="s2">interventions man that&#39;s like throwing</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.309" end="00:51:25.319" style="s2">sticks at an elephant you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.589" end="00:51:26.670" style="s2">gonna get anywhere and one of the ways I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.319" end="00:51:29.240" style="s2">want to demonstrate this to you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.670" end="00:51:31.799" style="s2">gonna show you a film called crumb</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.240" end="00:51:34.260" style="s2">crumbs a harsh film but it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.799" end="00:51:36.210" style="s2">documentary by the way underground comic</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.260" end="00:51:39.809" style="s2">named Robert Crumb who&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.210" end="00:51:42.270" style="s2">a genius even though he&#39;s perverse in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.809" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">precisely the Freudian ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.270" end="00:51:47.670" style="s2">interesting and his brothers are even</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:49.289" style="s2">worse so I&#39;ll walk you through that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.670" end="00:51:51.150" style="s2">because I can&#39;t figure out any other way</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.289" end="00:51:53.970" style="s2">of giving you a taste of what Freud is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.150" end="00:51:56.099" style="s2">psychopathology is like it&#39;s not pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.970" end="00:51:58.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s the other reason that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.099" end="00:52:00.410" style="s2">clean minded research scientists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.020" end="00:52:03.660" style="s2">like psychoanalytic thinking because</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.410" end="00:52:06.150" style="s2">it&#39;s really in many ways it deals with</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.660" end="00:52:10.799" style="s2">the most disgusting elements of human</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.150" end="00:52:13.349" style="s2">behavior and so it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.799" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">pleasant to think about and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.349" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">you who we&#39;ll talk about after Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:23.789" style="s2">Jung is so strange that he makes Freud</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:26.010" style="s2">look normal and you believed that as I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.789" end="00:52:28.380" style="s2">mentioned earlier believed that there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.010" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">a universal grammar of ethics of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.380" end="00:52:33.000" style="s2">morality it&#39;s not arbitrary it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.890" style="s2">relative you know in the Universities</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.000" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">the theory has been at least since the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.890" end="00:52:40.619" style="s2">1960s that one person&#39;s ethics is as</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:41.910" style="s2">good as another person and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.619" end="00:52:45.360" style="s2">way of distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.910" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">reliably between them well I</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.900" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">they weren&#39;t messing around you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.150" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">to read people like Franco Viktor Frankl</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">and then tell examiner&#39;s Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:49.349" style="s2">and what those two people lived through</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:51.490" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s unimaginably horrible and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.349" end="01:00:53.349" style="s2">when they were wrestling with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.490" end="01:00:56.109" style="s2">questions that I just described</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.349" end="01:01:00.039" style="s2">they weren&#39;t academic they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.109" end="01:01:03.069" style="s2">academic issues they were embodied</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.039" end="01:01:09.339" style="s2">issues of life and culture and genocide</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.069" end="01:01:13.450" style="s2">and cruelty and so their examination of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.339" end="01:01:15.339" style="s2">that had to be deep enough to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.450" end="01:01:17.470" style="s2">contend with questions like that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.339" end="01:01:19.720" style="s2">answers that are deep enough to contend</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.470" end="01:01:24.700" style="s2">with questions like that are frightening</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.720" end="01:01:27.420" style="s2">answers when we have Reading Week it</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.700" end="01:01:27.420" style="s2">would be a relief</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.309" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">the last part of the course this is when</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.369" end="01:01:41.029" style="s2">we switch over to the more scientific</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:42.859" style="s2">domain and so we&#39;re gonna do two things</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.029" end="01:01:45.950" style="s2">as I said we&#39;re going to take a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.859" end="01:01:47.930" style="s2">deep look at how the brain functions as</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.950" end="01:01:51.349" style="s2">far as we know in our current state of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.930" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">unimaginable ignorance like we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.349" end="01:01:56.119" style="s2">really know so little</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:57.499" style="s2">maybe we know I&#39;ve been a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.119" end="01:01:59.240" style="s2">about the brain but we certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.499" end="01:02:01.220" style="s2">know anything yet about consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.240" end="01:02:03.559" style="s2">the consciousness seems to be a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.220" end="01:02:04.819" style="s2">well it&#39;s a relevant part of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.559" end="01:02:06.519" style="s2">right it&#39;s sort of the part that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.819" end="01:02:08.930" style="s2">everybody cares about this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.519" end="01:02:11.150" style="s2">consciousness in some sense seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.930" end="01:02:12.650" style="s2">you even more than your brain is you I</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.150" end="01:02:14.990" style="s2">mean your brain is just this thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.650" end="01:02:18.950" style="s2">inside your skull but your consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.990" end="01:02:22.369" style="s2">you know that&#39;s your being we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.950" end="01:02:24.829" style="s2">a clue about consciousness I are</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.369" end="01:02:28.789" style="s2">scientific we&#39;re not even needed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.829" end="01:02:30.470" style="s2">conceptualize it it&#39;s a real mystery so</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.789" end="01:02:32.210" style="s2">but having said that there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.470" end="01:02:34.069" style="s2">plenty of things that are interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.210" end="01:02:35.720" style="s2">do about the brain one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.069" end="01:02:37.460" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do and this is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.720" end="01:02:40.220" style="s2">associated with the Freud&#39;s idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.460" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">end you know the end for Freud was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.220" end="01:02:45.049" style="s2">natural self and so that was your</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:47.950" style="s2">primordial you could think about them as</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.049" end="01:02:51.109" style="s2">drives or dedications or or values</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.950" end="01:02:53.059" style="s2">values is probably the most doctor and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.109" end="01:02:55.430" style="s2">their sexuality those are the talk to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.059" end="01:02:57.710" style="s2">Freudian serves there&#39;s plenty others</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.430" end="01:02:59.660" style="s2">eating Freud didn&#39;t care about that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.710" end="01:03:03.289" style="s2">do now because everyone has an eating</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.660" end="01:03:05.239" style="s2">disorder or virtually everyone so for</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.289" end="01:03:07.369" style="s2">the Victorians it was sexuality for us</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.239" end="01:03:10.509" style="s2">it&#39;s food sex doesn&#39;t seem to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.369" end="01:03:12.849" style="s2">problem but we just can&#39;t eat anymore so</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.509" end="01:03:15.559" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.849" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">low-level biological systems in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.559" end="01:03:20.569" style="s2">brain and those are systems God some of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:23.509" style="s2">those systems are so old that even</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.569" end="01:03:26.809" style="s2">crustaceans have them so for example</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.509" end="01:03:28.759" style="s2">this is so cool so if you give a logs</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.809" end="01:03:30.549" style="s2">truths being defeated in a dominance</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.759" end="01:03:34.009" style="s2">fight because they fight for dominance</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.549" end="01:03:35.989" style="s2">and they might even know it if you mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.009" end="01:03:38.019" style="s2">the lobster if you take a lobster who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.989" end="01:03:39.859" style="s2">been defeated in the dominance dispute</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.019" end="01:03:42.170" style="s2">the bowl</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.859" end="01:03:43.999" style="s2">- his little lobster hole and poked and</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.170" end="01:03:45.950" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be when he&#39;s piloting he gets</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.999" end="01:03:47.329" style="s2">all collapse and you can&#39;t even really</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.950" end="01:03:49.309" style="s2">get him out of his hole with a stick</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.329" end="01:03:52.130" style="s2">because he&#39;s gonna sit in there you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.309" end="01:03:53.480" style="s2">be upset about his darlings defeat and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.130" end="01:03:55.759" style="s2">leave you go come on this is kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.480" end="01:03:58.730" style="s2">new lobster already go yeah and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.759" end="01:04:00.650" style="s2">not if you take that same monster and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.730" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">you give him antidepressants right after</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.650" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">he fights he won&#39;t go back into his cave</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:08.390" style="s2">and hide and you&#39;ll fight right away</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.839" end="01:04:11.329" style="s2">again and so you think that that means</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.390" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">that the circuitry that underlies our</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.329" end="01:04:19.180" style="s2">defeat related depression is 300 million</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:22.369" style="s2">years old and even crustaceans have it</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.180" end="01:04:24.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s way down in your brainstem man</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.369" end="01:04:27.349" style="s2">cuz lobsters hardly even have brains in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.410" end="01:04:29.299" style="s2">fact if the lobsters been talking he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.349" end="01:04:32.089" style="s2">being a dog lobster for a long time and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.299" end="01:04:34.099" style="s2">he gets defeated badly then when he goes</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.089" end="01:04:36.019" style="s2">off to pout he has to dissolve his whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.099" end="01:04:37.910" style="s2">brain it&#39;s all he does his dominance</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.019" end="01:04:42.319" style="s2">stop then he grows a new subordinate</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.910" end="01:04:44.029" style="s2">brain weasels around so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.319" end="01:04:45.499" style="s2">useful to think about the next time you</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.029" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">really get defeated because all that</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.499" end="01:04:49.940" style="s2">pain you&#39;re going through it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:51.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some circuit repairs to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.940" end="01:04:53.269" style="s2">and if you&#39;d be badly defeated well</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.950" end="01:04:55.700" style="s2">maybe you should just let yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.269" end="01:04:59.289" style="s2">collapse and all that stuff clear away</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.700" end="01:04:59.289" style="s2">so that you could come back</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.499" end="01:05:05.749" style="s2">so that&#39;s low level to stuff brain stem</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.950" end="01:05:08.059" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s way down at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.749" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">your being at home but we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.059" end="01:05:11.480" style="s2">about systems that are above that too</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:13.609" style="s2">but still low with a hypothalamus for</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.480" end="01:05:15.380" style="s2">example it&#39;s a very cool brain area it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.609" end="01:05:17.029" style="s2">sort of responsible for all the basics</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.349" end="01:05:25.009" style="s2">aggression looks like it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.670" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">different everyone has those systems you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.009" end="01:05:28.819" style="s2">know so they&#39;re like these sub beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:30.680" style="s2">that live inside us but there are also</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.519" end="01:05:40.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say well what do you mean angry</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.589" end="01:05:42.230" style="s2">he says well what happened to upset you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.220" end="01:05:43.430" style="s2">because he knows what anger meanings and</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.230" end="01:05:45.259" style="s2">the reason he knows that is cuz he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.430" end="01:05:48.350" style="s2">already got it in his head he&#39;s liked</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.259" end="01:05:51.020" style="s2">you he gets angry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.350" end="01:05:53.030" style="s2">it&#39;s afraid their basic emotions but not</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.020" end="01:05:54.650" style="s2">only the basic emotions but the basic</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.030" end="01:05:57.440" style="s2">motivations and so we&#39;re going to look</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.650" end="01:05:59.720" style="s2">at the brain systems that underlie the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.440" end="01:06:02.120" style="s2">basic motivations and the basic emotions</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.720" end="01:06:05.230" style="s2">and in some sense those systems are</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.120" end="01:06:07.490" style="s2">equivalent to the physiological</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.230" end="01:06:09.710" style="s2">incarnation of the in that Freud</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.490" end="01:06:11.420" style="s2">described at the end of the nineteenth</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.710" end="01:06:12.410" style="s2">century and so that&#39;s a nice way to look</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.420" end="01:06:15.380" style="s2">at it you&#39;ll go through the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.410" end="01:06:17.240" style="s2">psychoanalytic thinking which which kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.380" end="01:06:18.860" style="s2">of puts flesh on these systems because</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.240" end="01:06:20.360" style="s2">for the psychoanalyst and this is why</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.860" end="01:06:23.380" style="s2">they&#39;re still relevant those weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.360" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">just systems they were living</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.380" end="01:06:28.700" style="s2">personalities narrow one-eyed</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:31.370" style="s2">personalities then we want one thing but</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.700" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">personalities nonetheless ancient gods</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.370" end="01:06:35.900" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of looking at and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:40.940" style="s2">things you have to connect begin with</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.900" end="01:06:42.800" style="s2">whether you believe in them or not we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.940" end="01:06:45.710" style="s2">discuss all five traits as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.800" end="01:06:48.200" style="s2">extraversion as I said that&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.710" end="01:06:50.120" style="s2">emotion neuroticism that&#39;s negative</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.200" end="01:06:51.590" style="s2">emotion people vary on those dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.120" end="01:06:53.870" style="s2">agreeableness that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.590" end="01:06:56.030" style="s2">associated with the maternal behavior on</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.870" end="01:06:57.710" style="s2">one hand and predatory hunting on</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.030" end="01:07:00.020" style="s2">another to see what thieves are hunters</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.710" end="01:07:02.030" style="s2">and mammals it&#39;s a weird combination</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.020" end="01:07:03.860" style="s2">right because if you&#39;re a hunted animal</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.030" end="01:07:06.110" style="s2">you have to figure out how not to kill</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.860" end="01:07:07.760" style="s2">and eat your children right and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.110" end="01:07:09.500" style="s2">happens in lots of mammalian species</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.760" end="01:07:11.930" style="s2">especially among the males so they have</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.500" end="01:07:14.210" style="s2">to be moved away but he would beings</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.930" end="01:07:17.000" style="s2">have solved that more or less you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.210" end="01:07:18.920" style="s2">it gets complicated in mixed families</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.000" end="01:07:20.030" style="s2">because if you&#39;re the child of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.920" end="01:07:22.550" style="s2">stepparent</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.030" end="01:07:27.490" style="s2">you have 100 times the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.550" end="01:07:29.510" style="s2">being abused so we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.490" end="01:07:31.580" style="s2">conscientiousness which is a great</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.510" end="01:07:33.470" style="s2">predictor of long-term life success but</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.580" end="01:07:36.410" style="s2">also associated with fascist political</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.470" end="01:07:38.000" style="s2">priests predispositions because it turns</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.410" end="01:07:40.760" style="s2">out that the way you vote has very</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:43.240" style="s2">little to do with what you pay and very</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.760" end="01:07:48.050" style="s2">much to do with what your temperament is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.240" end="01:07:50.450" style="s2">so even for high level cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.050" end="01:07:54.440" style="s2">functions like political belief these</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.450" end="01:07:57.350" style="s2">underlying systems play a determining</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.440" end="01:07:59.840" style="s2">role last two things we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.350" end="01:08:01.869" style="s2">about performance prediction and by that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.840" end="01:08:06.069" style="s2">I mean well</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.869" end="01:08:07.900" style="s2">there&#39;s been accruing evidence you might</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.069" end="01:08:09.339" style="s2">say what what be what how do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.900" end="01:08:11.380" style="s2">happy life first of all I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.339" end="01:08:14.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a stupid question but we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.380" end="01:08:17.020" style="s2">because happiness isn&#39;t it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.109" end="01:08:20.380" style="s2">right name it&#39;s it&#39;s a way it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.020" end="01:08:22.420" style="s2">place to go it&#39;s a it&#39;s a manner of</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.380" end="01:08:24.540" style="s2">manifestation while your journey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.420" end="01:08:27.009" style="s2">something like that leaving that aside</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.540" end="01:08:29.440" style="s2">what do you need to live a high quality</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.009" end="01:08:32.529" style="s2">life well we kind of know that already</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.440" end="01:08:35.139" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s kind of obvious you need</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.529" end="01:08:38.199" style="s2">friends need intimate relationships you</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.139" end="01:08:39.790" style="s2">need meaningful work you know have any</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.199" end="01:08:41.079" style="s2">more money than will pay your bills</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.790" end="01:08:43.719" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help that much</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.079" end="01:08:45.670" style="s2">etc it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.719" end="01:08:46.449" style="s2">intelligent moderation of discipline</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.670" end="01:08:48.579" style="s2">it&#39;s very boring</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.449" end="01:08:51.719" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.579" end="01:08:53.409" style="s2">were pessimistic about excitement</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.719" end="01:08:55.329" style="s2">performance prediction we&#39;re going look</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.409" end="01:08:56.829" style="s2">very carefully at the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.329" end="01:08:58.089" style="s2">traits that make people successful in</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.829" end="01:09:00.099" style="s2">life and you know you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.089" end="01:09:02.559" style="s2">what do you mean by successful you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.099" end="01:09:04.779" style="s2">one of the things I mean is not in too</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.559" end="01:09:06.309" style="s2">much pain and anxiety does that turns</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.779" end="01:09:08.739" style="s2">out to actually be more important to</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.309" end="01:09:10.809" style="s2">people than being happy you know what</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.739" end="01:09:12.069" style="s2">you say to people what do you want they</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.809" end="01:09:14.380" style="s2">say they want to be happy but if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.069" end="01:09:17.349" style="s2">analyze what they mean by happy they</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.380" end="01:09:20.079" style="s2">mostly mean not suffering and not</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.349" end="01:09:21.940" style="s2">terrified you get those two things under</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.079" end="01:09:25.210" style="s2">control like the worst that can happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.940" end="01:09:27.759" style="s2">to you is that you&#39;ll be bored so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.210" end="01:09:34.389" style="s2">then we&#39;ll wrap it up at the end ok so</p>
