<p begin="00:00:01.839" end="00:00:04.400" style="s2">all right welcome to the solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:06.720" style="s2">raising on shelter</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.400" end="00:00:08.320" style="s2">so this is specifically shelter did i</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">call it shelter housing like not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.320" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">community aspect of it but the physical</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.000" style="s2">structure that keeps you safe from</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:16.480" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.000" end="00:00:18.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good enough definition so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.480" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">like all solution reasons let&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.080" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">talk for 50 or roughly 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">on what shelter currently looks like for</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">us for everybody else in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">and then switch over to what we would</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:30.560" style="s2">love it to look like</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">in our ideal vision of the future</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.560" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">however are the future you need that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.320" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">and then the last half we&#39;ll discuss</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">what we could do</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">to empower people in the area of shelter</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">if we had 10 000 people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">so who would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:58.719" style="s2">i can start no one else like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.079" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">um this is hard because shelter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">like like in order to have shelter</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">you need the physical thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">the roof and the walls and the doors and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">the windows hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">and the space to put it and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">a city those are very intimately tied</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">you need to buy the land and you build</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s supposed to last for</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.920" style="s2">50 100 years just which is no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">they build them to last you know 10</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">maybe 20 years i know in my neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">there&#39;s construction on both sides of me</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">right now because every time a house</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2">sells it&#39;s being torn down in a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">one&#39;s being built</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.280" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">because the property taxes are way too</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">high here to um</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">pay for your land pay your property</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">taxes and not have a million dollar home</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">like the house i live in is a million</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">dollar home it&#39;s not a million-dollar</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">home the property it&#39;s sitting on is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">so that is a bit of my shelter and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">looking to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">like rent is astronomically expensive</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">the newer like tiny houses if you buy</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">them and don&#39;t build them yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">are still in the price range of what a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">mortgage used to be a generation ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">like a mortgage with a house and a yard</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have the land to put it on</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">like that doesn&#39;t include the tiny house</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">it includes the tiny house not the rest</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">so um this is a topic that i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">tackled we haven&#39;t tackled yet because i</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">what a solution is and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why it excites me also talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">it because i don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna i</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">have no idea what&#39;s gonna come up in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">third section</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">sometimes i have an inkling how about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">you guys what is your shelter situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">or what how do you see shelter right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">well it&#39;s funny you mentioned cities</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">because i think i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s an important um</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">distinction to be drawing right because</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">i mean cities have a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">attract people to them right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s excitement and there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">know movies and theaters and sports</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">teams and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">lots of jobs and all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">thing but but</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">you know cities would grow forever given</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">all of those attractions but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">things that holds back the growth of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">city is limitation</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">on exactly that on space and thus</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">housing</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">um so yeah while a city is popular given</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">that there is a finite amount of land</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">you can build houses on while the city&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">popular is attracting people the only</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">way that that can be expressed is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">elevation of house prices right because</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">the demand for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">the people you know the demand for of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">for housing from people coming in cannot</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">be met by</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">new housing being produced so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">inevitable consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">is an increase in prices so but but that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">but that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">has knock-on effects right i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">what i&#39;ve done with my life is i sold up</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">in the uk and i bought in spain which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">much cheaper right and so i was able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">get a lot more for my money have a chunk</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">of cash aside and so i don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">but my point is if lots of people do</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">that then the prices of properties in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">rural spain start to go up which means</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">that the locals can no longer afford to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">buy property here anymore you know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">i mean and so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">the spill out effect of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">from cities who can&#39;t afford to buy in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">the cities and they move out to rural</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">areas because it&#39;s cheaper make the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">rural areas more expensive people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">live there can&#39;t live there anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">so on and so on and so on and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">so on right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a non-stop ripple effect um that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">goes on and it goes on you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">as i said it goes right across the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not contained by</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">national</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">borders so yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">a massive problem while people continue</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">to flow into cities</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">and the cities can&#39;t keep up with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">demand for housing and the prices in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">cities go up to the point where people</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">move out of the cities to find but there</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">but then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s well money is connected</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">to housing while you have to have money</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">in order to get housing there are always</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">going to be lots and lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">can&#39;t get housing it&#39;s as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">well for me shelter has been um a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">thing um jubilee and i think carrie</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">know that i i drove across canada my um</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t sure how far society was going</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">to degrade so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">i uh packed up everything i needed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">gave up my apartment here in regina and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">drove 32 hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">with one stop to ottawa</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">and so i lived with my</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">my eldest daughter to self to isolate</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">quarantine for 14 days</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">that was my youngest daughter for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">month and a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">and then with my uh siblings in montreal</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">and then my friends in trenton for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">and then friends here in regina</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">for another two weeks another friend for</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">another two weeks and finally an</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">apartment</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">so for me shelter personally is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">without it it&#39;s very unsettling</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">much more unsettling than i i would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">thought like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">disrupts my my thought pattern you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">so i i understand how it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">for somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">and and personally in the midst of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">i&#39;m downsizing i gave away my king-size</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">bed i loved it when i first</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">got a king-sized bed like 35 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">couldn&#39;t wait to get rid of it after</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">traipsing across the country and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">putting my stuff in storage</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">so now i&#39;m of the mindset i want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">to minimize as much as i can and have</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">something as small as possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s that&#39;s an unsettling thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">because a lot of my friends have big</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">sea-doos boats you know they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">hard workers</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:48.639" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to judge them i i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">just on a sea doo uh this weekend i</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">used to have one and i i loved it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">then i thought having that and the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">cottage on the lake</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">versus how it feels when i&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">there something</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">feeling not right versus when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;ve got what i need i feel safe i</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">settled and that feeling inside if i had</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">to compare the two</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">i would go towards a minimal i think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">going to end up in a tiny house that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">i was just going to mention tiny houses</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">too if you hadn&#39;t already heard them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">also there&#39;s a documentary on netflix</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s on netflix called</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">minimalism it might be on youtube as</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">well worth a look if you haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">you&#39;ll find it really interesting if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">yeah it feels it feels like that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">i&#39;m headed i&#39;m i&#39;m more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s less and less dissonance in me</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">the more i&#39;m headed that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">all right i can go um</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">okay so first i&#39;m just gonna uh name</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">drop</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">uh this book there so i&#39;m from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">so my shelter perceptions uh are</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">partially</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">uh you know covered in</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">what i notice here in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">um there is an awesome book</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">called building suburbia that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">uh goes into like a 200 year history of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">like how we&#39;ve built out suburbs and why</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">cities are the way that they are and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">things like that and like the problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">with them and some of the good things i</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">guess what i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">is just like list a couple problems that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">i notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">and then in the second half maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">just talk about one of them but i</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">noticed a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">our shelter is related to economics</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">i think that as long as we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">shelter as an investment rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">a place where people actually live</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">um we&#39;ve got a big problem um</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">because we&#39;re you know it it&#39;s entangled</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">uh making money off of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">off of property but human beings have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">live there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very complicated i do think we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">have a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">um like we&#39;ve got these problems yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">at the same time um with where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">in the last hundred years with building</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">materials and safety</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">like in some ways it&#39;s better than it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">ever been</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">but in other ways it&#39;s hurting people</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">economically so some other parts of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">i think we overuse some buildings as</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">shelter</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">that&#39;s like large homes empty nesters</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">with four bedroom houses and they just</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">live in the one and then they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">extra bedrooms that aren&#39;t being used so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">homes that aren&#39;t being utilized they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">not filled up and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">families like with large families that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">are in like a two-bedroom apartment</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an exchange that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">being made</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">i think that we misuse other properties</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">um i think about churches that like can</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">pack a whole bunch of people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">yet you know should part of the building</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">be used as a homeless shelter or</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">something like that we&#39;re misusing uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">property i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">big landowners the elite landowners are</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">not on the side</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">of the people um and i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">use shelter as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">for flourishing there&#39;s like cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">um these tiny houses were mentioned i</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">know someone that&#39;s doing van life</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of flourishing from</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">van life</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">like they get to move around the country</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">all the time this awesome sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">traveling and like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">that is happening it&#39;s like holding up</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">certain cultural perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">is not helpful for like the primates</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">that we are um and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s related to depression and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">things like that so there&#39;s like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">laundry list of stuff that&#39;s all i got</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">okay well aid and edinburgh are talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">about shelter and some of the big hotels</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">because they were lying empty</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">um all the homeless people were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">pulling there</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">i would be able to afford to live in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">vancouver and own it</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">at the same time if people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">buying um especially</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">you know people who don&#39;t have canadian</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">citizenship they&#39;re not living here</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re buying it as an investment</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">and no one&#39;s living in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">if that didn&#39;t exist maybe i could</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">afford to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">to rent would be cheaper for sure and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">i could afford like if the city owned it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">or we owned it collectively i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t i&#39;m glad i have my</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">landlord needs a fairly good landlord</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">and yet i agree like i agree that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">that there&#39;s not that they&#39;re parasites</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">because i think like anything in game a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">they&#39;re doing the best they can and some</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">of them you know like they have a home</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re figuring how to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">their ends meet they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">another home so they can rent it out and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">they see it as it like employing someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">they&#39;re getting and they are taking a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">risk however</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">we&#39;re about to see that risk come to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">fruition during cobit 19 when people</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">can&#39;t pay rent and then they can&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">rent and they can&#39;t pay their mortgages</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">if anyone has anything else to add</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">during this section before we switch to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">what it could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">i mean i think you&#39;re right let some</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">landlords do the best that or many</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:21.680" style="s2">landlords even i mean i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">the numbers are it&#39;s irrelevant but many</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">are doing the best they can i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">you but they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">trapped in this thing where they have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">loan on a property which they have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">repay and they have to feed their</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">families and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">the fact is with the best will in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">world they are they are they</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">they are required to make a profit on</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">the rent from the building right and if</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">just people needing somewhere to live</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s not like this is a luxury</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">thing right this is people need</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">somewhere to live</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">and that is being made profits from if</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">the demand for profit wasn&#39;t there you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">could as</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">as you started saying right you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">collectively own the building with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">other people living there pay the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">mortgage collectively and it would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">to cost you less than the rent that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">are currently paying right because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">rate you&#39;re paying has to include</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">a profit for the landlord right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a piece of it that&#39;s no longer</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">you know what i mean no</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">i mean for for like a decade when my</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">parents bought a house the one house</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">they owned we bought it because</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">mortgages were cheaper than rent</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">there is actually a risk because people</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">are like real estate goes up and up and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">up and up so because that&#39;s that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">in our head</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">you can like you can rent out your place</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">for 2 000 let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">the bank your mortgage might absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">be 2 500 3 000</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">and you are paying the difference and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re not getting that rent you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">to cover 3</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">000 not everyone is making that profit</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">because part of it is their</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the investment right they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">to sell it off eventually and get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">and so they&#39;re not necessarily making a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">profit off the rent itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">or they they own like this in vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of laneway houses</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s something you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">build on your property and rent out</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">and they&#39;re expensive like they&#39;re tiny</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">homes really that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">physically cemented to the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">they&#39;re just as expensive as</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">anything else in vancouver i i would add</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">that we can&#39;t talk about economics</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">without talking about scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">and the folks that own this property can</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">create scarcity by either making things</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">less available or increasing the price</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">i&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">one example i&#39;ll just keep this</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">but um someone has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">rental property and so far nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">moved in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">well they also have a full-time job the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">the person who owns the property</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">they can set the price say</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">x amount so far no one&#39;s moved in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">apparently no one can afford it but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">person also has a full-time job so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">say well i&#39;m just gonna wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">the house can sit empty until someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">comes along who can afford it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">or instead they could lower the price</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">where probably someone could move in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">but because they&#39;re not the person is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">not dependent on the income</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">to pay the taxes on the rental property</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">they can be like i&#39;ll just wait till</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">uh comes along who can afford it and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">the house</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">sits empty uh and there is a scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a fake scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">i guess i want to say a word in in favor</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">of the parasites</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">it feels to me like it&#39;s it&#39;s a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">like i know people who are struggling</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">uh in jamaica where i was born in other</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">places who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">just try to do better for their family</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">by renting out a room or something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">you know holding down two jobs and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">maybe buying a property</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">to move out of a neighborhood so i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a scale and it&#39;s and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the thing we are trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">and are all propagating to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">and if it may be in the purchases you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">make and the investments you make</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">you move from one area to another you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">you know you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">advantage of that same system but there</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">the mega predators not mega predator</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">calling them predators or parasites</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">again they&#39;re just very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">at the game and they take it to such an</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">obscene level</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t even recognize it as the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">and i think that we have to take some</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">kind of ownership of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">but if we change if we can change</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">what is seen as the benefit of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">so in the benefit what they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">trying to do is try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">to to live their optimal life if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">redefine what an optimal life</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">looks like then this no longer becomes</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">a thing to go after that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">that was a great segway mark into what</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">we would love it to look like what does</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">that look like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">500 years in the future however far in</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">the future you need it to be for it to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">be plausible</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">what does shelter look like for you for</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to start if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">want mark anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">well i i think i would like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">i would like to see will be for me if if</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">shelter were seen more as</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">a holistic thing so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">it brought those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">really valuable like the billionaire who</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">marries a young woman to try and feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.360" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">validated and try and feel something so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">he&#39;s given everything to earn those</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">billions and yet he marries this</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">young girl who he knows will take him</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">all his money why he&#39;s after that thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s really valuable that deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">connectedness that feeling wanted that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">that goes beyond pleasure i think so</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">if if that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">kind of extracted out and and shown as</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">this thing that you can get by living in</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">a shared tiny house and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">just a kind of a wonderful you take a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">if we could demonstrate that right in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">the middle of game a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">where there is all these people living</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">in these tiny houses</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">who are healthy who are just</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">extremely productive who are welcoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">or able to take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">who have some of those same game a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">skills you know like</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">fit able to defend themselves sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">that could become the thing of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">this is the thing to go after now not</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">this but</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">you you ended up saying not quite what i</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">thought you were gonna say when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">first started off</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">um i was i was thinking when you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">more of a holistic thing i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">where it&#39;s more of an access thing right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">and of course you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">moving house every week i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">mean that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">you know like everyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">and i know there&#39;s a lot of messiness</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">with this but just just stay with me</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">everyone has a house right and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">exchanges emerge</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">when you want to go on holiday you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">to go to the bahamas wherever and so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">get in touch with people who have houses</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">in bahamas and some of them will want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:35.200" style="s2">come to your country you figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">to exchange your houses and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">when you&#39;re bored of living in one place</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">i want to move to somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">and so you know you get on an exchange</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">in that area and you find someone who</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">wants to move to your area and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">so on and so on and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">the notion of ownership is is gone right</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">you no longer own your house in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">sense that it is an asset which you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">sell for money it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">is an asset which you can exchange with</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">other people right and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">so but the starting point of that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">that there is always enough for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not a game of musical chairs but</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">there&#39;s always people left out homeless</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">right there&#39;s not not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">but where there is a maybe a small</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">surplus right there&#39;s always a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">standing empties just to have spare</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">capacity kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">but basically there is one house per</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">unit of demand right be it a family</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">being a person being a couple whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">it is right there there is one</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">unit of accommodation and i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">to sound like everyone lives in the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">square block either</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">and i get that it&#39;s messy because</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">there&#39;s different houses in different</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">places and there&#39;s going to be people</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">who want the same thing and yeah well i</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">get it&#39;s messy but</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">broadly speaking that&#39;s my ideal vision</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">of the future right where there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">healthy moving around of people from</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">house to house to house with not any</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">real need to do anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">maintain</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">and update the existing stock you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">what i mean because the population i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">assuming is</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">relatively static globally as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s i think i think i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">it made</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">um i i can go i</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">i appreciate that it was said</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a messy conversation um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">think this</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">right now is uh the format it&#39;s not long</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">to get into the messiness of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">so like with that being said because</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">we&#39;ve got problems with</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">yeah i love this uh um</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">housing exchange sort of thing your</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">shelter exchange</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">um and and diminishing the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">ownership but we got problems with</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">who does the maintenance and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">um who responsibility like so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:48.200" style="s2">it&#39;s i want these rights but</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">rights have to come with</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.200" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">responsibilities and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s messy and that&#39;s it&#39;s an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">long it&#39;s a much longer conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">um i would like to have the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">about how many oh uh how many homes a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">can own um this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">uh a conversation that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">normally have</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">but should one person be able to own</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">more than one home</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">should one person be able to own more</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">than three homes</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">um this is uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">we could have laws about this um how</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">many homes</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">um an individual can own i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">problem so therefore what do i dream</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">i haven&#39;t fully had that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">but i could imagine having a law</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">about how many homes a person is allowed</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">to own</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">i think that would help things a lot um</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">and lastly i guess just</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">i think that shelter should be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">tool for human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">um if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">if you go to burning man it will change</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">your perception on like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">purpose of shelter</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">um it becomes less aesthetic and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">um more utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">well we need to block ourselves from</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">these elements</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">um and when you get down to that level</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">then i think you understand the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">of communal</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">spaces more like okay so i need a place</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">to rest my head and like a quiet place</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">to study</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">the library kind of thing but then these</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">other spaces are like</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">communal spaces um and we should have</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">more of that uh more communal spaces</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">uh that would be very good if you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">thanks daniel do you want to share yours</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">carrie i know yeah it&#39;s just um</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">i think um in my perfect beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">for shelter</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;d be able to buy your own but you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">be made to live in it you wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">allowed to buy one unless you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">in it right so no no rent it out for</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">money but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">there was also be places available for</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want to live on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">road</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">or who aren&#39;t capable of living on their</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">own so there&#39;d be like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">kind of like communal family set up</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">where you know people who didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">live on their own could live in a place</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">and there&#39;d be sort of a block there but</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">also the the the be socializing</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">um affordable prices not like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">so-called affordable prices</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">that then people can actually rent now</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">um because you know they saved the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">social housing yet to get thrown up and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">they&#39;re like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">you can buy it for 600 000 pounds and i</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s in and that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">know what i mean but even just so they</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">um to pay that out there&#39;s mortgage and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">that but i think you you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">options you need to have options whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">to rent</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">or to or to buy and if you&#39;re gonna buy</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">you need to live in it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">right and i think that that would be</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">um normal circumstances with normal</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">decent rents that people can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">then they take it off them</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">take it off them and develop social more</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">social stuff and then that&#39;ll like</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">what we could do what would be the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">powerful thing we could do to empower</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">people to get shelter now right like</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily live in that ideal</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">world yet um with ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">and a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">i&#39;ll go if i had ten thousand people and</p>

<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">i&#39;d invest and i&#39;d actually buy a place</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">and start that off so anybody who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">have anywhere to stay could actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">come so it&#39;d be a bit like a hostel</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">a bit like a bed and breakfast but it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">be up to you know i mean it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">just be about</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">oh you just come and stay here and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve got no network of people but if</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">you&#39;re about open them but</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">then from that i would probably end up</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">buying</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">more of them so they&#39;ll be so once</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">people got used to source like on their</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">feet and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">used to live in in place and that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:23.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">so they hopefully invest in another one</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">and give that and fight because you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">find out whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">they want to live on their own or that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">you know happy living with so like so</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">once that house got full i&#39;d get another</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">and just you know leave the people with</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">if they would happy there then they</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">wanted to stay</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">leave them there and then buy another</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">one and do the same again</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">so you&#39;d you&#39;d have people who were</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">actually living in the properties</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">um in a way that they wanted to and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">a rent and help getting the help that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">they could so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">that would be all tied in with that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">then so yeah so there would be a string</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">of them but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">but give them the option to buy so like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">once say once you&#39;ve bought a place and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">people want to stay there</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">and live there and if they get on their</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:09.279" style="s2">feet and get jobs and stuff and if they</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:11.200" style="s2">wanted the option to buy it i&#39;d write</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.279" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">that in so they could buy a plate for</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.200" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">um and maybe so they&#39;d get them to leave</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">back to a pot so i don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">you&#39;d have to set it up as a trust so</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">to make sure that nobody could come in</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">and change the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">and saying well you know you can sell</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">this and make all the money and run off</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">with the money so i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what i&#39;d do if i had that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">yeah thanks carrie</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">i mean ten thousand people a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">thousand dollars that&#39;s ten dollars each</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">right so either putting it in</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">um you&#39;re not going to get ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">people shelter for ten dollars each</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">but if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">website i could go to and get help</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">building a tiny house</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">get help um buying the materials in bulk</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to cost 40 60 000 to just</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">even build it myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">that we can share in the labor like barn</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">raisings um</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">possibly have a plot of and then find</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">plots of land right that people can</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">rent or kind of like trailer parks but</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">you know guppified</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">finding uh just comparing comparing</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">building materials or cobb houses the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">best or yurts or like</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">being able to buy and sell used ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">so that people know that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">resource is available would be something</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">that i could see as a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">solution for for me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">i think the best thing you could do i</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">like a lot of what carrie said</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">i&#39;m this is a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">uh problem for me to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">solutions about</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">but i think if you went very practical</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">like like you&#39;re saying ten dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">i think you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">you could buy maybe some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">could buy a house and run it as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">like 10 000 people together could buy a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">house and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">and run it as a non-profit to rent</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">out to people where maybe you have some</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">kind of model where you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">trying to cover taxes um</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">what would that be a affordable housing</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s the best i can come up</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">so the 10 000 people are essentially</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">but i don&#39;t see it as altruistic here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">a way to tilt the world in a better</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">place to get the world you want</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">borrow some money to do a small scale</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">group of tiny homes you know that are</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">a look or</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">danielle mentioned this to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">involved you&#39;re personally invested in</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">and hopefully it it catches on you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s again i&#39;m much more in favor</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">here&#39;s what works and it&#39;s i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">want to send the the stormtroopers to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">your house to take that house away from</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">i think government is just really really</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">bad at that kind of stuff it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">it goes like who where do you draw the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">who&#39;s who says that somebody&#39;s too rich</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">and if if if i go and enable those</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">enable those those those forces to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">this is the line</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">who&#39;s to say somebody will come after me</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">and say no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">that line won&#39;t work this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">lie and you now have too much</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to take that from you i</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger in that and if we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">if we could say</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">that this is really a good way to live</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">and look look at look at this community</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:05.280" style="s2">and look at how it&#39;s flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">you know don&#39;t you want to become part</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">of that and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">10 000 people could kind of get that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">going in my mind anyways</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">i have a solution that&#39;s coming up um</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">you guys familiar with habitat for</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">and how their business model or what</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">we&#39;ll call the business model works</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">they what it is i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">model like the people who get the house</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">they put in enough time</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">they are putting in sweat equity and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">think when they get the house they</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">either don&#39;t have a mortgage on it or</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a low enough mortgage that they can</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">cover it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">um because the community builds it with</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">them right and so you have to put in</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">doing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">like that but not for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">necessarily low income</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:50.079" style="s2">um of all income levels and saying right</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">with 10 000 people we want to house 10</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.079" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">000 people eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">but you don&#39;t necessarily know where on</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna fall um and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">putting</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">in ten dollars for the material my guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">is you could build it two or three tiny</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">houses for a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">and um and then the people living in</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">there are paying</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">rent to the you know like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">effectively paying a mortgage back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">the pool</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">in order to be able to buy the material</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">to build the nest but the labor and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">ingenuity and like the information&#39;s fed</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">back into the system so that every like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">if you get a house in the beginning yay</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:22.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s not going to be as good as</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.839" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">yeah all the 10</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.400" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">000 people that signed up for this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;d be putting like a lottery</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">like you kind of just be waiting until</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">your number came up like oh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">we&#39;re moving into the tiny house village</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">and the people that were there at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">are paying for the next three houses and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">then the next three houses</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">and it would it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">exponentially growing thing right</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">because the more houses you have people</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">paying rent the faster the next lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">houses can be built right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very slow to get going as you say</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">you&#39;re only doing three or four at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">time to start with</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">but once you&#39;ve got 20 or 30 now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">doing a dozen at a time and then when</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve got 50 you&#39;re doing 30 at a time</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">when you&#39;ve got 100 you&#39;re doing 50 at a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">and so on and so on right it it all</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">expands very rapidly but</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good idea it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">good idea and with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">clever finance</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know a great deal about</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">this a little bit of clever finance once</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">a solid guaranteed monthly</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">amount of money going into a pool that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">can provide a guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">for a loan which could then accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">the process further right you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">actually get upfront capital</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">to build houses before you&#39;d accumulated</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">enough from contributions if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">to get into all of that i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">risk obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">and this is one of those projects it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">really cool idea i love it it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s really good and it also very</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">quickly expands beyond the 10</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">000 right i mean once this has got a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">hundred people it now becomes a thing an</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">actual substantial thing generating</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">a substantial amount of monthly revenue</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">and it becomes an attractor now right it</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s a that&#39;s a fucking awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">like housing which i was going to say in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">the beginning is resources</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">labor and land right so if we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">buying resources and doing it ethically</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">you know i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">however that looks that the land can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">done on an</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">if a farmer wants can offer a spot for</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">five places to park right or somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">with rural lands</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t work out and you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">find so you can find land pretty easy</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">you can use resources and we&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">in labor</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">right for things like electricians and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">plumbers i guarantee you in that ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">thousand you have someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">that has that but even if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">those are the ones you&#39;re paying for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">and everyone else is like that&#39;s habitat</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">for humanity you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">a skilled laborer you can just go and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">volunteer and in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">you know like you maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">volunteering two weeks out of the year</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">and live in a tiny house and build more</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">tiny houses or whatever this looks like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">i mean i would love to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">kind of reminds me of uh and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">like a housing exchange</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">um there i&#39;ve never stayed at one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">these but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">group of campsites in the us i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">know if they&#39;re international called</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">koa and like you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">go camping like if you&#39;re not a member</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">you can still roll up and say like hey i</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">need a campsite for the night</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">but you can become a member of koa camp</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">sites and they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">campsites all over the u.s and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">kind of part of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">koa campsite network um</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know much about it beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">that but i could see</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">okay so land is scarce and so if this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">were to multiply and build you&#39;d the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:38.720" style="s2">or whatever organization was running</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">this they&#39;d be like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:43.599" style="s2">we have you know some land over here</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">some land in this country some land in</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:48.720" style="s2">this country and like</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">maybe you have some fluidity where</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.720" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">once you were in one of the houses you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">almost have like a six month or twelve</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">like a time share sort of similar to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">timeshare sort of community right where</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">you&#39;re all moving around within each</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">property pool yeah so yeah all of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">coming back it&#39;s a really cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s got real potential</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">so what you have to do is like look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">what are the ways this could fail</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">i guess what are the downsides well i i</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">straight away can see a couple right</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">logistically it&#39;s very tricky you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">10</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">000 people in the early stages anyway</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got 10 000 people contributing</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">their manpower and expertise and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s the building of three</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">houses right you can&#39;t have all 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">clustering around three houses right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">fair distribution of you know making</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">sure that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">does their bit in the whole process of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">getting 10 000 homes built right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">very very tricky to keep track of and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that everyone must</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">expend exactly the same number of jewels</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">of energy in their contribution i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">mean that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">but just that some</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">some method of anti-defect because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">would be quite easy i think in a pool of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">10 000 people it would be quite easy to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">sit there and be invisible and not do</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">anything and end up getting your house</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">built for you the only one you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">contributed to was your one you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">what i mean i think it&#39;d be quite easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">for people to disappear into that kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">of thing if</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing so</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">habitat for humanity and i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">people you put in sweat equity right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">you don&#39;t get your house until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">built four right like you don&#39;t get your</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">house until you&#39;ve equivalently built</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">four or something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">right like there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">and so and or did you make a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">to build to be involved in four other</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">builds afterwards even though you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">yeah right and most people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">habitat for humanity are never getting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">house right they&#39;re there because they</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">want to give someone else a house</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">they&#39;re there because they want to give</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">that labor</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">and that might be the point right and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">you&#39;re giving 10 a month and you never</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">build a house and you never get a house</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">you&#39;re still helping other people get</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">houses and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">enough of an incentive and then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">never have to go and build it if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">enjoyable to go build it like if i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">about abundance farm</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">which is a farm here that you can it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a community owned actually no sir</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not community owned but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">kind of kind of community owned and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">go and participate in the labor and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">get food out of it right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">instead of going and paying people</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">minimum wage to pick food they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">collectively using their labor and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">fun to go there it&#39;s a community event</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">did you how many strawberries per hour</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">did you pick right and they&#39;re eating</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">together and singing together</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it like building together</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">is fun if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">you know like for profit gotta get</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">enough out like you wanna get them out</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">you wanna be efficient you also wanna</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:30.079" style="s2">make the next ones better and buy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">in bulk so it&#39;s cheaper and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">it&#39;s efficient and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s so many places to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">they&#39;re even like with the pareto</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">eighty percent will do twenty twenty</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">percent will do eighty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">hopefully they get their houses first</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">we need to have to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">some spectrum of merit</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">based on participation uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">one to one um because then you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">then it gets competitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">also in the game b space</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">how do you make it omni win how do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">make it win win</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">um and not rival risk if it was a one to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">whoever puts in the most hours gets the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">house first</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">i mean then you have what you have like</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:26.559" style="s2">this rush of people putting in hours</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">some people then you know we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.559" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">to combat</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">bad luck so some folks</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">you need of some mix of lottery</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">and participation maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">i like what jubilee said cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">that feeling of we&#39;re doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">fun right we&#39;re doing it because we want</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">other people to get houses right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">not doing it for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it primarily to make houses</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">for other people that need them right</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">and if at some point along the road i</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">get one myself then so much the best but</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s so cut some finding ways to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">cultivate that spirit</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">feels feels like the right feels like</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">ratio or you say you know for the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">10 houses are only for other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">and then after that then we build one</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">for one of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">uh or you have a ratio that&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.079" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">to one</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">for every two houses we make for other</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">then there&#39;s one for us i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">just throwing</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">ideas out there yeah i mean i some some</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">i do think some kind of merit</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">recognition of contribution kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">thing i thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">without getting all gestapo about it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">you know encouraging lots of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">signaling and all that i do think some</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">kind of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">of level of contribution i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very it becomes very tricky very</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">quickly i want to let mark speak because</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">he was just about to and i know he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">his he&#39;s not as big as interrupting</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">people as the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">so and then yeah not as big an</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">interruption</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t interrupt people we do well i</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">like to listen to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">uh it&#39;s i i think it&#39;s a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">what jubilee said and what daniel said</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">happens organically but there</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">there is a big plus to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">doing something to tilt the world in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">right direction and if that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">was the biggest piece like providing</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">homes for people who can&#39;t afford them</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">it gives people hope</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">and takes them off the street you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s something that is a win-win</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">for everyone to provide homes and maybe</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">better direction absolutely the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">thing that was coming up was the exact</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:24.559" style="s2">that the first people let&#39;s say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">10 people who have the skills to build</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.559" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">their own house</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">and they do it in a way where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">offering that knowledge to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">else and so they get</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">like 100 000 goes to their material</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">showcasing it in like a youtube video</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">type way so that people</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">can can follow along but they&#39;re also so</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">now they have their little tiny village</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to pay rent and they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">focus on using these skills to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">to um have teams to build more and more</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">the people who have the highest skills</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">to give</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">in this area get their houses so they</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.440" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about that stress</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">and then they get to build because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">going to be something that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">passionate about if it&#39;s something they</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">like to do right and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">continually build the houses um and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">also like what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">said about yes building them for people</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">who like the homeless and people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">don&#39;t who aren&#39;t necessarily gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">it and then figuring out how to build</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">them for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">within that yeah it&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">between building</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">different houses for people that already</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">have houses and building houses people</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">that don&#39;t have houses that are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">yeah there is a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">those two things</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">but just even having a community of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">like if i i&#39;m not one of those 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t have again the skill but if i</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">was one of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">you know like then i don&#39;t have to i</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">just have to work the buzz saw i just</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">pound the nails in like it isn&#39;t i just</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">have to follow a direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t necessarily have to have all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">that information and that i love that i</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">want to be the sous chef not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">person in charge in things like manual</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what i enjoy i would think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:06.319" style="s2">it&#39;s important to recognize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">value think of the people volunteering</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.319" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">for habitat for humanity</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">even if they never get a house they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">gaining valuable skills and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">learning valuable things</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">so emphasizing that hey if you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">done plumbing before there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">to learn this and you just gain the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">uh and you can take that with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">there you go there&#39;s your omni win</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">scenario right everybody definitely wins</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve made it i&#39;ve rent i rented my</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">whole life</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t do things on the house they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">interesting perceptions about um</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">insurance or what would happen if</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:53.359" style="s2">something goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t do upgrades i can&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">how to do plumbing on this house if</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">something breaks</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">they have to do it where do i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:02.079" style="s2">sure i guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">places to go to learn it but i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.079" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">saying that&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">um so we&#39;re getting down to the hour i</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">would like to go around and share what</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">we think is the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">thing that we could do with ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">people and a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">that we discussed or comes up in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">and then we will stop the recording and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">you all can continue the conversation if</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">you would like well</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">i go prepare for my next conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">for the day</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">i said exasperate i&#39;m super excited</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">about my next conversation for the day</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">well i&#39;ll i&#39;ll go um i just have two</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">one i think that it&#39;s normal i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">in organizations</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">that count volunteer hours um</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">and so for events yeah if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">volunteered you count the volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">hours and you get a discount</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">uh on your ticket or if you do enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">you could get a free ticket to the next</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">event so i think it&#39;s normal to count</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">volunteer hours that could be applicable</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">to this idea and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">i love the second thing is i love the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">idea of like keeping a mission in mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">you know what if the overall mission was</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">like do this project and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">for every 10 houses the group built for</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">itself it also built</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">a house for outside the group</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">for homeless or something and so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">keep this ratio</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">um and i think that keeping like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">in mind would keep things</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">right there with silence for a few</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">seconds so i will share mine i do think</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">um having</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">the habitat for humanity people putting</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">in 10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:41.119" style="s2">and then we start building them and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">showcase that in a transparent</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:44.319" style="s2">fun way so that people can feel like</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">they&#39;re participating in it</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.319" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">and make sure it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">doing this out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">that same habitat for humanity feeling</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">and if you get a house out of it awesome</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">and that was the other that the people</p>
