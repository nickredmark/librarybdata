<p begin="00:00:02.429" end="00:00:10.869" style="s2">So, welcome to Maps of Meaning. So the first<br />question I guess I might have is, what, why</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.869" end="00:00:19.930" style="s2">are you here? Anybody got an interesting reason?<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Uh, I want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.930" end="00:00:24.410" style="s2">to manipulate reality to my best interests.]<br />&gt;&gt;That&#39;s a good plan.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.410" end="00:00:24.980" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Yeah.]</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.980" end="00:00:26.850" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Except for the manipulate part.<br />[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.850" end="00:00:31.210" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Maybe my wording is off?]<br />&gt;&gt;It&#39;s okay.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.210" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">&gt;&gt;It&#39;s better to work with reality, generally,<br />than to manipulate it cause it tends to hit</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:40.240" style="s2">back. Anyone else? Yeah.<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Uhh, my friend took this</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.400" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">class a couple years ago and he kind of threatened<br />me to take it.]</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.540" end="00:00:44.680" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Oh yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.680" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Cause apparently he said<br />that the course actually changes likeï¿½]</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:49.060" style="s2">&gt;&gt;For the, for the better?<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Yeah.]</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.060" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">[Students&#39; laughter]<br />&gt;&gt;That&#39;s good.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:53.480" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: You made him write a short<br />story or something, and made him want to become</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.580" end="00:00:55.460" style="s2">an author. Now he&#39;s a published author.]<br />&gt;&gt;Really?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.660" end="00:00:56.900" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student: Yeah]<br />&gt;&gt;Is he any good?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.900" end="00:00:58.580" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: I never read his book<br />actually.]</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.580" end="00:00:59.200" style="s2">[Students&#39; laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.200" end="00:01:02.540" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Ooh. Some friend you are. No wonder he threatens<br />you. Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.540" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: I audited this course<br />six years ago, and the course changed the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.850" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">way I see the world. So I want to see after<br />six years what happens now.]</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.869" end="00:01:13.669" style="s2">&gt;&gt;You want to see if it&#39;ll change back?<br />[Students&#39; laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.669" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">Well that&#39;s good.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:19.260" style="s2">So why did you decide, why, uh, why after<br />all this time did you decide to come back?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.260" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Well I thought about the<br />things you discussed in the class over those</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:25.580" style="s2">six years, but now, um, it&#39;s been awhile and<br />I want to refresh myself and see, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:32.600" style="s2">with the new experience I&#39;ve had, and the<br />new things I&#39;ve learned, how and what I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.600" end="00:01:35.240" style="s2">take from it now.]<br />&gt;&gt;Hmm, hmm. Well that&#39;s very, um, dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.240" end="00:01:36.229" style="s2">and hopefully useful.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.229" end="00:01:40.250" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: My friend said that he<br />had a spiritual awakening from taking this</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.250" end="00:01:44.439" style="s2">course.]<br />&gt;&gt;God, I hope I didn&#39;t see that. He did, eh?</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.439" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student: Yeah]<br />&gt;&gt;Did he give you any, any, like, any, description</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:53.259" style="s2">or? Was it associated with an epileptic seizure?<br />[Students&#39; laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.259" end="00:01:57.379" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student: It was associated with a lot of<br />like, visions]</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.380" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Oh really, eh? Oh that&#39;s interesting. Yeah<br />that can get out of hand, that sort of thing,</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:04.579" style="s2">you know. No, that&#39;s, that&#39;s interesting.<br />I mean, one of the things that I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.579" end="00:02:07.990" style="s2">when I started to learn some of the things<br />that I&#39;m going to talk to you guys about is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.990" end="00:02:14.059" style="s2">a very radical increase in the intensity and<br />clarity of my dreams. It wasn&#39;t pleasant,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.059" end="00:02:21.719" style="s2">by the way. But, it was useful. Most useful<br />things aren&#39;t that pleasant. So you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.719" end="00:02:25.349" style="s2">for some of the same punishment, I guess that&#39;s<br />the plan, is it?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.349" end="00:02:26.029" style="s2">[Student answers]</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.029" end="00:02:33.549" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Alright, alright, anybody else?<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: I sort of have an independent</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.560" end="00:02:40.460" style="s2">interest in Existential Psychology. Nietzsche,<br />Jung, etc. This seemed like a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.460" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">discuss it, and I took your previous class,<br />personality.]</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.069" end="00:02:44.909" style="s2">Personality?<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: I liked it a lot.]</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.909" end="00:02:47.609" style="s2">&gt;&gt;When did you take that?<br />&gt;&gt;[Student answers: Couple years ago.]</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.609" end="00:02:52.849" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Yeah? Yeah, well it&#39;s a good preparation<br />for this class. Now, is there anybody here</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.849" end="00:02:56.870" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t have any idea what this class<br />is about, and more or less showed up because</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.870" end="00:03:01.439" style="s2">the time is right or anything like that? So<br />you don&#39;t really have any idea what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.439" end="00:03:04.039" style="s2">in for?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.320" style="s2">[Student answers]</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.329" end="00:03:15.809" style="s2">Alright, well I&#39;m gonna jump right into it<br />because why not? So I&#39;m gonna talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.809" end="00:03:19.189" style="s2">for about two hours, and then you can have<br />a break, and then I&#39;m gonna tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.189" end="00:03:24.049" style="s2">you have to do in the class. But, by that<br />time you&#39;ll know if you wanna take the class</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.049" end="00:03:27.620" style="s2">because you&#39;ll know whether or not you were<br />interested in what I told you about. So I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:32.829" style="s2">going to video the class - I always do that.<br />So the videos will be online, ones from previous</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.829" end="00:03:38.749" style="s2">years are online as well. So hopefully that&#39;ll<br />be a useful resource. It shouldn&#39;t take me</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.749" end="00:03:44.689" style="s2">as much setup time the next time as it did<br />me today. I&#39;m still getting used to this equipment.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.689" end="00:03:53.769" style="s2">So, I wanna tell you why I&#39;m telling you the<br />things that I&#39;m going to tell you. When I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:04:01.540" style="s2">was approximately the same age that you people<br />are, probably a little bit older as I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.540" end="00:04:06.579" style="s2">you guys are around 21 or something like that.<br />I was probably about your age and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.579" end="00:04:10.749" style="s2">years older. First year I was in graduate<br />school, in particular, which I guess was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.749" end="00:04:14.900" style="s2">1985, so I was 23 then.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.900" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">That was in 1985, and there are a couple of<br />times in the late 20th century where the Cold</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">War really came to a peak. And one time, I<br />guess, was probably in about 1957 when, I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:34.360" style="s2">think it was 57. I hope I have my dates right.<br />Whenever Stalin announced that he had developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.360" end="00:04:39.949" style="s2">a hydrogen bomb, and I don&#39;t know how much<br />you guys know about hydrogen bombs, but all</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.949" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">you really need to know about a hydrogen bomb<br />is that they use atom bombs as a trigger.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:55.909" style="s2">So they&#39;re quite the weapon, and the USSR<br />and the US made some very, very big ones.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.909" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">They&#39;re big enough to make the thing that<br />was dropped on Hiroshima look like dynamite.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:06.719" style="s2">So, hundreds and hundreds of times bigger<br />- maybe thousands of times. It&#39;s been awhile</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.719" end="00:05:08.509" style="s2">since I looked into it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.509" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">And then in 1962, there was the Cuban Missile<br />Crisis - I have a good story about that. So,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:22.979" style="s2">about ten years ago, I went down to Tucson,<br />Arizona to a conference on consciousness there.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.979" end="00:05:28.930" style="s2">And they have that conference fairly frequently<br />in Tucson. It&#39;s become quite a popular conference</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:31.810" style="s2">even though it isn&#39;t clear to me that we know<br />anything more about consciousness than we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.810" end="00:05:37.860" style="s2">did before the conference started. And, Tucson&#39;s<br />kind of an interesting town. It&#39;s in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.860" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">of the desert, the cool desert, with the big<br />sort of Saguaro road runner cactuses. But</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">it&#39;s also extremely dry there which is, of<br />course, what you&#39;d expect given that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:54.139" style="s2">a desert. So one of the things that Americans<br />do with Tucson is store old fighter planes</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.139" end="00:05:59.800" style="s2">there. And so there is an airplane museum,<br />which is an amazing place. It has maybe 500</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:04.879" style="s2">planes including John F Kennedy&#39;s Air Force<br />One, which is the jet that he used to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.879" end="00:06:07.610" style="s2">around the world - it didn&#39;t have a shower<br />by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.610" end="00:06:11.030" style="s2">It&#39;s funny because on the outside it looked<br />like a modern jet, but on the inside, it looked</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.030" end="00:06:17.370" style="s2">pretty much like it was from World War Two<br />because 1962 is a lot closer to World War</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.370" end="00:06:22.169" style="s2">Two than it is it now, in all sorts of ways.<br />Even the rockets that went to the moon looked</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.169" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">like they were built by people who were using<br />World War Two technology - they were full</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.340" end="00:06:35.539" style="s2">switches, mechanical switches, and it&#39;s pretty<br />basic. Anyways, as well as the airport museum,</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.539" end="00:06:39.099" style="s2">which is a very interesting place - there&#39;s<br />B-52 bombers there and all sorts of things.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.099" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">Those things are huge. There&#39;s also an airport<br />graveyard where they store old fighter jets</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.326" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of old fighter jets so there&#39;s<br />acres, and acres, and acres, and thousands</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:53.740" style="s2">and thousands of old mothballed fighter jets<br />lined up in the desert. So that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.740" end="00:06:59.219" style="s2">cool in a strange way, but there was one other<br />thing down there that I went and saw which</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.219" end="00:07:05.849" style="s2">was a decommissioned nuclear missile site<br />and it was an intercontinental ballistic missile</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.849" end="00:07:11.610" style="s2">site and those were built in the fifties and<br />early sixties, and they were major league</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.610" end="00:07:19.020" style="s2">rockets, those things. I think the silo, cause<br />we could go into the silo, and it was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.020" end="00:07:22.389" style="s2">farther across in diameter than this room.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.599" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">I would think probably twice as large as this<br />room, so you can imagine how big a missile</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:32.439" style="s2">that would be - it&#39;s not your grandmother&#39;s<br />missile. It&#39;s a major league piece of armament,</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.439" end="00:07:36.999" style="s2">and out on the grounds - these things were<br />underground, deep underground, because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.999" end="00:07:42.289" style="s2">didn&#39;t want them to get blown up if they were<br />bombed, so they buried them quite a long ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.289" end="00:07:46.900" style="s2">down and to get into it, you had to go through<br />this massive steel door that was like a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.900" end="00:07:53.949" style="s2">safe door except, you know ten times as big,<br />and ten times as thick. Out in the yard of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.949" end="00:07:59.080" style="s2">the nuclear missile site, there were fences<br />with barbed wire on them of course, and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.080" end="00:08:04.919" style="s2">was a missile cap. It&#39;d be the nose cone of<br />the missile. Some of these missiles had single</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.919" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">warheads, which were more than sufficient<br />to demolish a city and some of them had multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:15.189" style="s2">warheads, so they would shoot out into space<br />and then come back into Earth and then they</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.189" end="00:08:19.349" style="s2">essentialy break apart or disperse into multiple<br />missiles and then you can really bomb the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.349" end="00:08:23.800" style="s2">hell out of whatever you were going to bomb<br />instead of just destroying one city.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.800" end="00:08:27.289" style="s2">And so, the nose cone was sitting out there<br />and that was a pretty freaky looking thing,</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.289" end="00:08:33.029" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you. Like it was big. It was about<br />seven feet high I would think, and maybe about</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.029" end="00:08:38.120" style="s2">the same amount across. It was made of this<br />plastic, kind of variegated plastic material</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.120" end="00:08:42.849" style="s2">that was about three-quarters of an inch thick<br />and then it would melt off, of course, on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.849" end="00:08:48.709" style="s2">re-entry because as I said these things shot<br />out into space, and so that was kind of unnerving</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.709" end="00:08:54.699" style="s2">really, in a serious way. So we&#39;re at the<br />missile site and you know, I mentioned your</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.699" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s missile. There was actually<br />a reason for that. It was a bit of foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:03.420" style="s2">because it was a very funny place because<br />at the front of the missile site there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:08.990" style="s2">sort of this museum set up, you know, and<br />it had pictures of Reagan and Gorbachev on</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.990" end="00:09:13.916" style="s2">it because they decommissioned the missile<br />sites when detente occurred and then when</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.250" end="00:09:18.190" style="s2">Perestroika hit, and the Soviet Union started<br />to collapse, and so there were all these pictures</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.190" end="00:09:23.940" style="s2">of Reagan and Gorbachev from 1984 and so the<br />museum was kind of like a time capsule of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.940" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">1984, and the people who were running it were,<br />like, retired Arizonans. And they were like</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">your grandparents, assuming you have retired<br />Arizonans for your grandparents.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:39.389" style="s2">But they&#39;re real friendly and they&#39;re pretty<br />happy to show you their nuclear missile museum</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.389" end="00:09:42.820" style="s2">and it was sort of like being in their rec<br />room, except that it was a nuclear missile</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.820" end="00:09:49.079" style="s2">site and they were hospitable and it was weird,<br />you know. It&#39;s like welcome to - you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.079" end="00:09:54.459" style="s2">welcome people to a nuclear missile site.<br />It&#39;s just not reasonable and so it was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.459" end="00:09:59.089" style="s2">disconcerting and it was disconcerting that<br />it was locked in the 1980&#39;s and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.089" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">disconcerting that it was friendly and hospitable<br />and, you know they were kind of proud to show</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:09.459" style="s2">it off and happy to be there, and then when<br />you went down into the nuclear missile silo</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.459" end="00:10:15.970" style="s2">proper - the control center, it&#39;s sort of<br />like Star Trek, you know, from 1966 or 1967</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.970" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">except more primitive. I don&#39;t remember if<br />the Star Trek control command area was modeled</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:29.790" style="s2">after the nuclear missile site control systems<br />or if it was the other way around but I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.790" end="00:10:35.759" style="s2">it was that they were modeled after the nuclear<br />controls but that was really 1950&#39;s - like</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.759" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">the whole place was painted in that pastel<br />green that, you know, late fifties and early</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">sixties people really liked.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:47.790" style="s2">And it had this 1950&#39;s - what would you call<br />it - aesthetic. And you wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.790" end="00:10:51.540" style="s2">think that a nuclear missile site would have<br />an aesthetic but it does, and it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.540" end="00:10:59.630" style="s2">high tech 1957 technology. So they brought<br />you into the control room and the control</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.630" end="00:11:03.769" style="s2">desk was probably - or the module or whatever you might<br />call it - was about three times as long as</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.769" end="00:11:09.009" style="s2">this - maybe four times. It was a pretty impressive<br />piece of machinery and the way you launch</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.009" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">the missiles was not too secure in my humble<br />opinion. What happened was, one guy wore the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.220" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">key around his neck. And then another guy wore the key around his neck.</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:23.009" style="s2">In order to launch the sites, you had to put<br />the keys in the same time, and they were far</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.009" end="00:11:27.480" style="s2">enough apart so nobody could stretch their<br />arms, you know, which was kind of the high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.480" end="00:11:33.550" style="s2">part of it. So, and, he had to put a key in,<br />and you both had to turn the key for 10 seconds.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.550" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">Okay, so, and one thing you may know about<br />ballistic missiles or you may not, is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">not cruise missiles. Once you set those things<br />off, they&#39;re not coming back. They&#39;re bullets.</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">That&#39;s what makes them ballistic. You know,<br />if you aim a gun at someone and you shoot,</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">and you decide halfway, when the bullet&#39;s halfway<br />there, maybe that wasn&#39;t a good thing to do,</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:56.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a little late because you&#39;re not telling<br />that bullet to come back.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.839" end="00:12:00.699" style="s2">And it&#39;s the same with ballistic missiles,<br />and those things are going a lot faster than</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.699" end="00:12:07.930" style="s2">bullets, you know, like a 22 bullet goes about<br />the speed of sound, but a ballistic missile,</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.930" end="00:12:11.810" style="s2">that thing has to go around 7 miles a second<br />to get out of the gravity o f the earth. Now</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.810" end="00:12:16.149" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure they go quite that fast because<br />that&#39;s escape velocity right, You need to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.149" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">that to get out of the gravitational well.<br />But to get out there into space, you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">to be damn close to 7 miles a second. So it&#39;s<br />a bullet, a very large bullet with a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:31.173" style="s2">explosive head on it going 7 miles a second.<br />And once you turn those two keys man, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.529" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">it. There&#39;s no turning back. That&#39;s that.<br />And so they took us through a simulated launch</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:43.430" style="s2">which still kind of, it&#39;s still an uncanny<br />feeling remembering that, you know, because</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.430" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a hell of a thing to apprehend. And then<br />they told us that the keys were in once. Right.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">So we were ten seconds away. Now they wouldn&#39;t<br />tell us when, but we know when. It was during</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:12:57.180" style="s2">the cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.180" end="00:13:03.100" style="s2">So, you know, there are a couple of times<br />in the latter part of the 20th century, where</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.100" end="00:13:10.579" style="s2">we made it through the eye of a needle, we<br />barely bloody well made it. And, the cuban</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.579" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">missile crisis was one of those points. But<br />in the early 80&#39;s, things were heating up</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:20.139" style="s2">pretty badly too. In about 1984, there was<br />a movie that came out, called The Day After.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.139" end="00:13:24.339" style="s2">You guys probably don&#39;t know about The Day<br />After. But it was the most watched movie that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.339" end="00:13:30.019" style="s2">had ever been broadcast on TV at that point.<br />And basically what it showed was, what a city</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.019" end="00:13:36.970" style="s2">would be like, the day after the United States<br />had been bombed into total desolation by a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.970" end="00:13:41.930" style="s2">Soviet missile attack. And you know, it was<br />a pretty hair raising movie. And one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.930" end="00:13:45.449" style="s2">things that was quite interesting about it<br />was that Ronald Reagan later said that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.449" end="00:13:49.389" style="s2">watched that movie and that was actually part<br />of the reason that he entered into Detente</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.389" end="00:13:52.089" style="s2">talks with the Soviets.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.089" end="00:13:57.389" style="s2">Now you know, Reagan had been basically been<br />scaring the hell out of the Soviets. He had</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.389" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">called them an evil empire, which the liberals<br />weren&#39;t very happy about, but the Soviets</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:06.250" style="s2">man, they were an evil empire. There&#39;s absolutely<br />no doubt about it. It&#39;s not obvious how many</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.250" end="00:14:11.879" style="s2">people the soviets killed, during their Communist<br />Revolution and years following that. But the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.879" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">estimates range from twenty to sixty million.<br />Now that&#39;s a lot of people. Like even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:22.129" style="s2">twenty million, that&#39;s three times as many<br />people as were killed in the holocaust. You</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.129" end="00:14:27.690" style="s2">know, the Soviets starved six million Ukrainians<br />in the 1930s and that was just to get warmed</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.690" end="00:14:34.100" style="s2">up. So the idea that the Soviets were an evil<br />empire, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s a strong word, but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.100" end="00:14:37.740" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no doubt that it was true<br />and the more we learn about what happened,</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.740" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">especially during the Stalinist period, although<br />Lenin was no picnic. He pretty much created</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:46.339" style="s2">the Stalinist monster that followed him.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.339" end="00:14:53.139" style="s2">The more we learn about it, the more horrible<br />it becomes. And the Soviet system was operated,</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.139" end="00:14:58.690" style="s2">the economy fundamentally ran on slave labor,<br />for what economy there was. What happened</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.690" end="00:15:02.970" style="s2">with Reagan in part was, first of all the<br />soviet union was falling apart because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.970" end="00:15:08.310" style="s2">just so long you can keep a sinking ship afloat.<br />And something that big can die twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.310" end="00:15:16.339" style="s2">before it falls over. A system like that can<br />stumble along half-gutted and still manage.</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.339" end="00:15:19.425" style="s2">And so, by the time Reagan had come along,<br />the thing had probably pretty much burned</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.649" end="00:15:24.579" style="s2">itself out as a consequence of internal contradictions.<br />But he ramped up american military spending</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.579" end="00:15:29.579" style="s2">to a staggering degree. And part of the idea<br />behind that, at least that&#39;s what the Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.579" end="00:15:32.779" style="s2">would have everyone believe, and that might<br />be true, is that they&#39;re just going to spend</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.779" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">the Russians right into bankruptcy - and they<br />basically did, and so that was that for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:42.519" style="s2">Soviet Union and it fell over in 1989 which<br />was like, that was a good day. That was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.519" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">really good day, and the weird thing is that<br />no one saw it coming. And that was shocking.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.209" end="00:15:53.632" style="s2">One day the Soviet Union was there and the<br />next day, the SU was gone. And there was gone</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.860" end="00:15:57.779" style="s2">CIA analysts that said hey yea, they&#39;re about<br />ready to crumble, you just have to blow on</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.779" end="00:16:00.509" style="s2">them and they&#39;ll fall over. It was a shock<br />to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.509" end="00:16:04.899" style="s2">You know, and then, it was very iffy in the<br />aftermath whether or not it would hold. Yeltsin,</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.899" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">who was a terrible drunkard, but actually<br />a pretty courageous, well he was russian,</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:16.189" style="s2">you know. He was a pretty courageous guy and<br />he faced down reestablishment by the totalitarians</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.189" end="00:16:21.740" style="s2">on a tank. You know, that was good for him<br />because that was pretty frightening too. Anyways</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.740" end="00:16:29.034" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you all this because when I grew<br />up, most of the people I knew were convinced</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.300" end="00:16:34.300" style="s2">that there was no bloody way we were going<br />to make it to the 20th century. You know,</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.300" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">and I think, I remember discussing this with<br />all of my friends frequently, and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:43.819" style="s2">some people kind of use that as an excuse,<br />you know like what the hell&#39;s the point, you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.819" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">know, we&#39;re gonna blow ourselves up anyway<br />so i might as well drink vodka until i fall</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:52.540" style="s2">over. And you know, that&#39;s not really a particularly<br />moral way of looking at it, but I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.540" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">you that there was no shortage of thinking<br />that this was so insane that this would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:01.860" style="s2">end in absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:07.180" style="s2">And it damn near did, like it wasn&#39;t some<br />kind of collective delusion. You know, there</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.180" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">were times, in fact, there was a story recently<br />published, about a russian general who was</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">given the order to launch the missiles. There<br />was a mistake in reading on their display,</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2">showing that missiles were coming from north<br />america across the poles towards russia, and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:30.730" style="s2">he was told to launch, but he didn&#39;t. Well,<br />good for him, but, that&#39;s a little too close.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.730" end="00:17:34.930" style="s2">Really. And you know, there&#39;s all sorts of<br />other crazy things that had happened during</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.930" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">that period of time.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:42.540" style="s2">So for example, I read this book by an ex-KGB<br />guy who said he worked in a biological warfare</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:48.060" style="s2">lab in the soviet union. They killed a number<br />of people by accident when some of their bugs</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.060" end="00:17:53.350" style="s2">got out, on the order of 500 people, which<br />is a lot of people, but it&#39;s not like 250,000</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.350" end="00:17:58.180" style="s2">people. But it&#39;s a lot of people. But what<br />those geniuses were trying to do was cross</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.180" end="00:18:08.150" style="s2">ebola with smallpox. So small pox is unbelieveably<br />- the combination of smallpox and ebola is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.150" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">extraordinarily easy to transmit and very<br />very very fatal. And so, they were trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.200" end="00:18:19.103" style="s2">to cross it and then aerosolize it so you<br />could distribute it in canisters and blow</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:25.910" style="s2">it over cities. Nice bit of scientific investigation.<br />Perfectly reasonable scientific question - can</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.910" end="00:18:27.300" style="s2">it be done?</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.300" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">So, you know, it was a pretty crazy period<br />of time. And all human history - what did</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">Dostoevsky say about human history? The one<br />thing you can say about it is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:44.910" style="s2">rational. The very word sticks in your throat,<br />so it&#39;s always been crazy, and it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.910" end="00:18:50.100" style="s2">now, but it was really crazy then. And so,<br />we got through that, and thank god, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.100" end="00:18:54.390" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned, the world is a lot<br />better place now than it was, well it is,</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.390" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">thirty years ago, forty years ago, fifty years<br />ago. Things are way better now, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:05.390" style="s2">you hear a lot of doom and gloom about how<br />we&#39;re gonna destroy the planet, but we probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.390" end="00:19:13.310" style="s2">aren&#39;t. The population is gonna stabilize<br />out at around 9 billion. We already have 7,</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.310" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">we can handle another 2.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:21.680" style="s2">There&#39;s gonna be some extinctions - we&#39;re<br />eating up the ocean like insane piranha - that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.680" end="00:19:26.060" style="s2">mostly a fault of public policy, but it looks<br />like we&#39;re probably gonna squeak through the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.060" end="00:19:30.360" style="s2">century with a bit of damage and then things<br />are gonna settle down. It&#39;s highly probable</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.360" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">if theres anything vaguely human left in a<br />hundred years, that the big problem will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:38.910" style="s2">population is rapidly decreasing. And that&#39;s<br />already happening in european countries, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.910" end="00:19:43.990" style="s2">happening in japan, it&#39;s going to happen in<br />china. And so you know, by the year 2100,</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.990" end="00:19:48.680" style="s2">the most populous country in the world is<br />going to be nigeria, not china. China is going</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.680" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">to lose people like mad, because they have<br />a one child policy. And everybody in china</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:59.260" style="s2">is getting old, so it&#39;s not going to be hyper<br />populated. Anyways, so I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.260" end="00:20:04.360" style="s2">all this because i had felt I&#39;d grown up - I<br />didn&#39;t feel like I&#39;d grown up under its shadow</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.360" end="00:20:06.440" style="s2">- I had grown up under its shadow.</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.440" end="00:20:10.120" style="s2">It was something in the back of our minds<br />all the time. And there was a question underneath</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.120" end="00:20:19.040" style="s2">that, a couple of them, and one was - how<br />is this possible? How could it be that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.040" end="00:20:24.700" style="s2">world could divide itself up into two armed<br />camps - hyper armed camps - tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.700" end="00:20:29.550" style="s2">of nuclear missiles, more than enough to wipe<br />out the enemy many times over. I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.550" end="00:20:33.260" style="s2">what the american arsenal peaked out, but<br />i think it was more than fifty thousand nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.260" end="00:20:38.330" style="s2">weapons. I dont know if theres fifty thousand<br />towns in the Soviet Union. Maybe they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.330" end="00:20:43.250" style="s2">gonna bomb Moscow fifty times or something,<br />but after the first two or three, it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.250" end="00:20:49.910" style="s2">more or less irrelevant. So it was really,<br />it was really crazy. And I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.910" end="00:20:55.350" style="s2">know this, but - and I believe this was during<br />the Kennedy era, I hope I got this right.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.350" end="00:21:00.160" style="s2">One of kennedy&#39;s genius boys came up with<br />the - because kennedy&#39;s administration was</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.160" end="00:21:04.130" style="s2">run by a lot of harvard graduates and a lot<br />of ivy league graduates so they were supposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.130" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">to be pretty intelligent, but intelligence<br />and wisdom are not the same thing. Anyways,</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:14.490" style="s2">they established a policy which was called<br />Mutual Assured Destruction, which means if</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.490" end="00:21:19.990" style="s2">you hit me, I kill you, and then you kill<br />me so it would be better if we didn&#39;t bother.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.990" end="00:21:27.790" style="s2">And the acronym was MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction.<br />It&#39;s like, you know just thinking about that,</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.790" end="00:21:34.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a chilling thought - it&#39;s like what horrible<br />entity thought that up as a joke. You know</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.790" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">you think well is that some politicians idea<br />as wit? Where&#39;d that come from? So thats a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:46.210" style="s2">hell of a thing to make a joke about. MAD.<br />Well that was right, it was definitely mad.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.210" end="00:21:51.190" style="s2">And you know the odd thing is that we didnt<br />blow ourselves up and we didnt have a third</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:58.220" style="s2">world war, and you can&#39;t make a solid claim<br />the invention of nuclear weapons was necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.220" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">the worst thing that could&#39;ve happened because<br />even the soviets who were completely insane,</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">and of course the Maoists who were probably<br />even worse, they weren&#39;t insane enough to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">start a nuclear war.</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:16.040" style="s2">Now Stalin, there&#39;s evidence - there&#39;s debate<br />about it - but there&#39;s evidence that stalin</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.040" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">was basically murdered, partly by Khrushchev,<br />who was his successor. When Stalin died, Khrushchev</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:27.720" style="s2">and three other people were in his house and<br />what happened the night stalin had died is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.720" end="00:22:33.011" style="s2">not clear. But i read a book recently called<br />Stalin, interestingly enough, that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.230" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">written by a guy who had access to the full<br />Communist party archives, which was a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:43.907" style="s2">new thing, and that was his conclusion. He<br />also believed Stalin was gearing up to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.907" end="00:22:47.141" style="s2">an invasion of Europe, and that he didn&#39;t<br />give a damn about how many cities would have</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.430" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">to be bombed in order for the soviets to roll<br />through. And Stalin, he was like that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:57.750" style="s2">Stalin was perfectly capable of taking entire<br />nations of people out in Eastern Europe by</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.750" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">train and shipping them out to Siberia in<br />the middle of winter with nothing to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:07.759" style="s2">no tools and letting them live, which of course<br />they didnt - and that meant women, and children,</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.110" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">and men shorn of all their belongings and<br />thrust out into the middle of nowhere to perish</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.150" end="00:23:19.780" style="s2">or live as they saw fit. And if they perished,<br />so much the better, as far as Stalin was concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.780" end="00:23:25.530" style="s2">He wasn&#39;t exactly the sort of person the idea<br />of nuclear war would necessarily stop, and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.530" end="00:23:30.670" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly possible that&#39;s what he was<br />hoping for because when we look at people</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.670" end="00:23:36.620" style="s2">like Stalin and Hitler, we think they&#39;re after<br />world domination. You think in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.620" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a positive motivation - not<br />really - but it&#39;s like if you have a Corvette</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:46.570" style="s2">and someone steals it, you can think well<br />I know why they stole it, they wanted to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.570" end="00:23:53.700" style="s2">the Corvette! It&#39;s an understandable motivation<br />to want power, it&#39;s not necessarily an admirable</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.700" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">one, but sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable<br />thing to pursue. But, I don&#39;t have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:03.160" style="s2">why we ever assumed that those guys were after<br />victory.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.160" end="00:24:07.950" style="s2">You should never make the presupposition that<br />everyone is out to win - some people are out</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.950" end="00:24:13.130" style="s2">to lose, and the more people they take with<br />them, the better. When Hitler died, he committed</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.130" end="00:24:18.110" style="s2">suicide in a bunker way down below in Berlin,<br />when Berlin was on fire and Europe was burning.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.110" end="00:24:23.260" style="s2">And as far as I can tell, that was what Hitler<br />was after from the very beginning. He was</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.260" end="00:24:26.550" style="s2">interested in fire as a purifying agent.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.550" end="00:24:31.170" style="s2">He&#39;s a fire worshipper in some sense, because<br />if you look at the Nuremberg gatherings of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.170" end="00:24:37.870" style="s2">the Nazis, they were spectacular, spectacular<br />celebrations - unbelievably dramatic and impressive,</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.870" end="00:24:43.370" style="s2">and they frequently featured fire. And fire<br />is a purifying agent, and Hitler, by the end</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.370" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">of WW2, he was pretty contemptuous of the<br />Germans because they really hadn&#39;t served</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">him well. Now, it wasn&#39;t like he thought maybe<br />it wasn&#39;t such a good idea to start a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.730" style="s2">second world war, because he was a little<br />on the narcissistic side you might say.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.730" end="00:25:03.460" style="s2">But by the time the Russians came marching<br />in and Germany was in ruins, Hitler was perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.460" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">happy to have the allies tromp all over the<br />citizens, because that&#39;s what they deserved</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:12.260" style="s2">anyways. And so, that&#39;s the sort of guy he<br />was, and so, why we would assume he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.260" end="00:25:17.320" style="s2">to win just because that&#39;s what he said is<br />something I&#39;ve never been able to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.320" end="00:25:21.550" style="s2">The kids who shot up Columbine didnt want<br />to win, they wanted to kill as many people</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.550" end="00:25:25.250" style="s2">as possible to make a point, and then they<br />wanted to kill themselves - just in case you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.250" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">didnt exactly get the point. And the point<br />was: the more destruction, the better, and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:34.970" style="s2">if i have to go along with it, hey no problem,<br />that just makes me a little more serious than</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.970" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">i&#39;d otherwise been. Those sort of motivations<br />are not pleasant to understand. We have enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.990" style="s2">documentation about events like that, especially<br />the mass killings. Those guys have written</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.990" end="00:25:54.600" style="s2">down exactly why they do it. I have some excellent<br />books on extraordinarily vengeful serial killers</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.600" end="00:25:59.530" style="s2">and mass murderers. I know exactly how they<br />think.There&#39;s a great book on this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.530" end="00:26:04.020" style="s2">thing, if you&#39;re interested in this sort of<br />thing called Panzram.</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.020" end="00:26:10.020" style="s2">And Carl Panzram was a serial killer and rapist<br />who lived pretty much early in the 20th century.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.020" end="00:26:16.050" style="s2">He was a tough, delinquency sort of kid, from<br />a large family. When he was 13, 14, they sent</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.050" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">him off to some reform school. It was run<br />by the same sort of people that had run Canada&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.990" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">residential schools. So you know, they were<br />basically predators on children. And of course,</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:33.670" style="s2">he was raped, and brutalized, and tormented<br />in all sorts of horrible ways, but he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.670" end="00:26:38.610" style="s2">a tough guy. When he came out, he decided<br />the human race wasn&#39;t really worth that much</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.610" end="00:26:43.310" style="s2">and that he was going to wreak as much mayhem<br />as he possibly could for the rest of his life.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.310" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">He raped a thousand men. He killed dozens<br />of people. He kept track of the dollar value</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.470" end="00:26:57.450" style="s2">of the buildings he burned down. Like, this<br />was a serious guy. He was bent on destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.450" end="00:26:59.130" style="s2">And that&#39;s that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.130" end="00:27:04.600" style="s2">What were his dying words? First of all, there<br />was a committee, I believe of women, that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.600" end="00:27:11.220" style="s2">intervened on behalf of him, cause they were<br />anti-capital punishment, and he said to them,</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.220" end="00:27:15.040" style="s2">if I remember correctly, that he wished the<br />human race had one neck so he could put his</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.040" end="00:27:20.820" style="s2">hands around it and squeeze. So that was his<br />way of pointing out to the people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.820" end="00:27:25.330" style="s2">think that capital punishment was justified<br />in his case, that they maybe weren&#39;t thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.330" end="00:27:30.130" style="s2">clearly. Then to the hangman, he said hurry<br />up, you hoosier bastard. I could kill ten</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.130" end="00:27:35.490" style="s2">men in the time it takes you to kill me.<br />You don&#39;t get a statement like that from someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.490" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">who isn&#39;t thoroughly committed to what he&#39;s<br />doing. So, the situation in the world found</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:47.740" style="s2">itself involved in really had me thinking.<br />Part of it was well, what the hell&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:27:52.100" style="s2">on with all these weapons, and how can it<br />possibly be anyone thinks that&#39;s a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.100" end="00:27:57.240" style="s2">solution. How did it come about that this<br />could even occur, and what are we thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.240" end="00:28:02.730" style="s2">There&#39;s that, and there was also the why are<br />people so damn convinced on either side of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.730" end="00:28:07.890" style="s2">this argument that they&#39;re right enough to<br />risk everything for - which is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.890" end="00:28:10.600" style="s2">good question.<br />And then there was the malevolence issue,</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.600" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">with how much of this was wanting to see your<br />side win and everything to do with wanting</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.700" end="00:28:18.850" style="s2">to see everything lose. And then</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.850" end="00:28:34.400" style="s2">And then <br />there was another issue which was, well are<br />both sides wrong? Are both sides right? Because</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.400" end="00:28:37.830" style="s2">that&#39;s more of a cultural relativist approach<br />because yeah, yeah, the Communists believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.830" end="00:28:42.290" style="s2">one thing and the bloody capitalists believe<br />another and they&#39;re just as bad. Who believes</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.290" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">what is completely arbitrary because belief<br />systems are arbitrary, and so maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:50.650" style="s2">both right or they&#39;re both wrong. I thought<br />well, either of those conclusions were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.650" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">damn dismal because well, if they&#39;re both<br />right, what are you gonna do? Have them talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">it out? I don&#39;t think so. And if they&#39;re both<br />wrong, that&#39;s not much better. And then if</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:05.380" style="s2">one&#39;s right and the other&#39;s wrong - well does<br />that mean anything? Like is it possible for</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.380" end="00:29:10.090" style="s2">one belief system to be more right than another<br />belief system because of course, that&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.090" end="00:29:15.650" style="s2">not a tenet of moral relativism, and you might<br />think of that as the standard intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.650" end="00:29:20.200" style="s2">approach to morality, and has been for the<br />past hundred years. I think, by the way, that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.200" end="00:29:22.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a reprehensible morality.</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.460" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you why, as we move through the<br />course because one of the things I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">find out was was what we were fighting for<br />- assuming you give the West a bit of a benefit</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">of the doubt and assume that some of the things<br />we stand for, we actually stand for and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:48.730" style="s2">aren&#39;t just posturing, parading - grounded<br />in anything? Or was it just arbitrary opinion?</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.730" end="00:29:54.520" style="s2">So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to talk about.<br />We&#39;re going to talk about why people believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.520" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">the things they believe. What psychological<br />function does belief perform. We&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:09.110" style="s2">to talk about malevolence. As far as I can<br />tell, malevolence is the willingness to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.110" end="00:30:14.580" style="s2">evil, and I think the best definition of evil<br />- and I&#39;ve thought about this for a long time,</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.580" end="00:30:20.830" style="s2">like what constitutes evil, and it&#39;s complicated<br />- but I think if you want a one line summary,</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.830" end="00:30:25.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the desire to do harm for the sake of<br />the harm. So you have to think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.950" end="00:30:27.860" style="s2">a kind of art form.</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.860" end="00:30:32.350" style="s2">Look. If you have a terrorist and you think<br />he&#39;s hidden an atom bomb in the stadium, and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.350" end="00:30:35.490" style="s2">you think well, he&#39;s not gonna tell me - you<br />have good evidence - he&#39;s not gonna tell me</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.490" end="00:30:39.753" style="s2">unless I torture him. I don&#39;t think you should<br />torture him because torture is wrong. But you</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:44.450" style="s2">know, if you do that and you really believe<br />he&#39;s hidden an atom bomb in a stadium, at</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.450" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">least you have some justification for what<br />you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:52.750" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is evil - it might be wrong.<br />It might be misguided. But who&#39;s to say in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.750" end="00:30:59.100" style="s2">such a situation as that. It certainly should<br />be illegal. But at least you can say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.100" end="00:31:04.140" style="s2">a plausible explanation for it, but lots of<br />situations where there&#39;s absolute horror, there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.140" end="00:31:09.660" style="s2">no plausible explanation for whatsoever.<br />I can give you an example. One of the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.660" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">that used to happen in Auschwitz, if i remember<br />correctly - Auschwitz, I don&#39;t know what you guys envision</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:22.020" style="s2">when you guys envision concentration camps.<br />Concentration camp, it&#39;s a funny name first</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.020" end="00:31:26.800" style="s2">of all because it&#39;s not really a camp. You<br />know what i mean, but a concentration camp</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.800" end="00:31:33.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t like a prison. Thats easy to envision<br />them like a prison. Those bloody things were</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.350" end="00:31:38.520" style="s2">cities. They had tens of thousands of people<br />in them. They were massive. At least, they</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.520" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">were large towns. So these were very big places.</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">Anyways, at the typical concentration camp,<br />the trains would come rolling in and of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:50.760" style="s2">people had been packed into the damn trains,<br />well, worse than animals. They&#39;d be packed</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.760" end="00:31:56.270" style="s2">standing, and lots of people just died in<br />the cars, especially if they were old or little</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.270" end="00:31:59.560" style="s2">or had some respiratory problems or something<br />like that because they would overheat if they</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.560" end="00:32:03.100" style="s2">were cramped in the middle of people or they<br />would freeze to death along the outside because</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.100" end="00:32:07.270" style="s2">they would freeze against the wood. But that<br />was okay, it just made the job easier when</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.270" end="00:32:13.470" style="s2">they finally landed at Auschwitz. And then,<br />once they were in Auschwitz, the guards would</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.470" end="00:32:17.410" style="s2">play tricks on them. One trick would be to<br />get some poor son of a bitch, who&#39;d you know,</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:22.070" style="s2">been torn away from his country, who had his<br />family destroyed, who knew where he was going,</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.070" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">who was half dead for six different reasons.<br />Maybe he didn&#39;t even speak, or she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:34.970" style="s2">even speak that was most common there, guarded<br />by absolutely ruthless barbarians who wanted</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:40.560" style="s2">to do nothing else but make people as miserable<br />as possible in the most creative possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.560" end="00:32:41.740" style="s2">ways.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.740" end="00:32:45.080" style="s2">And so, what they would do was, some of the<br />prisoners, they would give them wet sacks</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.080" end="00:32:49.850" style="s2">of salt - and so those weighed about a hundred<br />pounds - and they&#39;d have them carry from one</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.850" end="00:32:57.330" style="s2">side of the compound to the other. Well, that&#39;s<br />not so bad, when you&#39;re really, really innovative</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.330" end="00:33:00.860" style="s2">in your capacity to perpetrate evil, and the<br />next thing they made them did was carry them</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.860" end="00:33:05.490" style="s2">back. You think about that, you know, and<br />this is something you have to understand if</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.490" end="00:33:12.120" style="s2">you really want to understand evil is that<br />it&#39;s an aesthetic, it&#39;s an art form. The reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.120" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">that was such a terrible torture was, well<br />partly because these people were already ruined,</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:19.920" style="s2">and a hundred pounds is a lot of salt, and<br />maybe it was winter and they didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.920" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">shoes, and - you know, like it was just brutal<br />labor.</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.510" style="s2">But Solzhenitsyn, when he wrote about the<br />Gulag Archipelago, he said, you know even</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.510" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">if you were a prisoner and they were having<br />you build a wall, you could at least take</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:34.430" style="s2">some damn pride in building the wall. You<br />could lay some bricks out, and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.430" end="00:33:38.510" style="s2">well this suck and it&#39;s really horrible and<br />everything but you know, I built a straight</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.510" end="00:33:43.350" style="s2">wall. That&#39;s something. But if you have to<br />take a sack of wet salt from one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.350" end="00:33:51.080" style="s2">compound and then carry it back, the net consequence<br />of that is zero. It&#39;s zero. And of course,</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.080" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">the famous sign on the outside of the concentration<br />camps were Work will set you free.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:05.180" style="s2">Right? Now that&#39;s another joke. It&#39;s like<br />mutual assured Destruction, and the only way</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.180" end="00:34:13.099" style="s2">you could - a joke like that is satanic. There&#39;s<br />no other way to think about it. A joke like</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.099" end="00:34:19.309" style="s2">that comes out of the deepest depths of human<br />malevolence. Then the work that sets you free,</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.309" end="00:34:25.819" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t even work. It was a parody of work.<br />And the purpose of the work was to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.819" end="00:34:33.039" style="s2">you, but not quickly because that&#39;s not as<br />terrible as destroying you slowly. So these</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.039" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">are very very terrible things. Part of what<br />I thought about in relation to people&#39;s belief</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:44.869" style="s2">systems was people are territorial. Chimps<br />- I don&#39;t know if you know this or not - chimps</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.869" end="00:34:50.119" style="s2">basically go to war.<br />Jane Goodall discovered that a couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.119" end="00:34:54.740" style="s2">ago and it really, really was hard on her<br />because she was kind of a Rousseauian. For</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.740" end="00:35:00.509" style="s2">those of you who don&#39;t know, Jean Jacques<br />Rousseau was a French philosopher and French</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.509" end="00:35:04.089" style="s2">philosophers have an awful lot of sins on<br />their conscience and Rousseau was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.089" end="00:35:10.619" style="s2">one of them because Rousseau was the first<br />fully articulate promoter of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.619" end="00:35:15.660" style="s2">human beings were basically good. So we had<br />a good soul in a moral sense, but we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.660" end="00:35:25.259" style="s2">corrupted by our social institutions. So,<br />as far as Rousseau is concerned, it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.259" end="00:35:27.349" style="s2">of a noble savage idea.</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.349" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">Like the human being in their raw form has<br />a pure soul and then you give them to parents,</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:36.359" style="s2">and you give them to teachers, and they get<br />into politics, then there&#39;s group disputes</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.359" end="00:35:42.109" style="s2">and they get all corrupted. Well that&#39;s it.<br />I don&#39;t even know what else to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.109" end="00:35:47.089" style="s2">except that it&#39;s absolutely moronic, but it&#39;s<br />an appealing proposition if you&#39;re a naive</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.089" end="00:35:51.160" style="s2">optimist. I mean, first of all, it doesn&#39;t<br />explain where malevolence comes from because</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.160" end="00:35:56.259" style="s2">the people created the institutions, so it<br />just puts you into an infinite regress. Chicken</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.259" end="00:36:00.990" style="s2">and egg. If the institutions are reprehensible<br />but the people who built them aren&#39;t, then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.990" end="00:36:04.329" style="s2">where did the reprehensible elements of the<br />institution come from?</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.329" end="00:36:08.509" style="s2">He might think thats its an auto generating<br />consequence of organizing people, but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.509" end="00:36:14.839" style="s2">know it&#39;s a pretty specious theory. Of course<br />he had a counterpart, a philosophical counterpart,</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.839" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">Thomas Hobbes and Hobbes said basically exactly<br />the opposite, that people were vicious and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:26.109" style="s2">cruel, and unless you put them in straitjackets<br />- fundamentally - and made them obey, everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.109" end="00:36:28.920" style="s2">was going to go immediately to hell.</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.920" end="00:36:34.099" style="s2">And when you saw what happened in Iran when<br />the Americans waltzed in, and then the power</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.099" end="00:36:38.059" style="s2">structure disintegrated, it was a hell of<br />a lot more like Hobbes than Rousseau. You</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.059" end="00:36:43.609" style="s2">took out the tyrant at the top and it wasn&#39;t<br />like everyone got all peaceful and loving</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.609" end="00:36:49.579" style="s2">all of a sudden. It was like absolute chaos<br />reigned. Of course, you can rationalize that.</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.579" end="00:36:56.220" style="s2">Anyways, Rousseau had five children by a maid<br />- an illiteral maid - that was his mistress,</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.220" end="00:37:00.809" style="s2">and he put every single one of them in orphanages,<br />and of course they perished because orphanages</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.809" end="00:37:06.890" style="s2">at Rousseau&#39;s time were not exactly a luxury<br />resort. Even up until the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.890" end="00:37:13.890" style="s2">20th century, who were under one years of<br />age, who were in care institutions die, partly</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.890" end="00:37:18.759" style="s2">disease and that sort of thing. But partly<br />because they weren&#39;t touched, cared for physical,</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.759" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">even if they were fed. And 200 years ago,<br />they weren&#39;t even fed. Anyways, nonetheless,</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:34.680" style="s2">people maintained the optimistic idea that<br />human beings were basically good and were</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.680" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">corrupted by institution. It&#39;s a very common<br />idea in universities.</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:44.390" style="s2">University people are always complaining about<br />the corrupt nature about this institution,</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.390" end="00:37:51.750" style="s2">and that institution, while they sit here<br />in the warmth with the electricity on. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.750" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">surrounded by wealth that characterizes maybe<br />one tenth of one percent of the entire world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">population, and they complained about how<br />oppressed they are and how nasty the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:07.220" style="s2">are. Well, you know you actually haven&#39;t been<br />to a nasty institution because they get pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.220" end="00:38:12.990" style="s2">damn bad. Most of the institutions in the<br />world are like that. So, it isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.990" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">clear that people are pristine in their heart<br />and corrupted by institutions, although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:21.069" style="s2">sure that happened. It happened with Panzram<br />for example.</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.069" end="00:38:28.990" style="s2">Anyways, this has been a line of philosophical<br />speculation that&#39;s - I would say, constituted</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.990" end="00:38:35.130" style="s2">one of the unspoken fundamental assumptions<br />of Western intellectuals in particular. Jane</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.130" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">Goodall thought, in many ways, the same way.<br />She thought chimps were basically animals,</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">they&#39;re okay. They co-exist relatively peacefully<br />with one another. Even Carl Rogers - who I</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.769" style="s2">talk about a bit in my Personality class - he<br />thought that people were basically fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.769" end="00:39:01.720" style="s2">good and that institutions made them bad.<br />But the problem is, you look at chimps and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.720" end="00:39:03.079" style="s2">they&#39;re a fair bit like us.</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.079" end="00:39:09.809" style="s2">Bonobos - you can look at them too, they&#39;re<br />genetically quite related to us, so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.809" end="00:39:16.029" style="s2">a weird mixture of the two. But chimps, like<br />those things, there is no evidence that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.029" end="00:39:21.880" style="s2">really have any internal control over their<br />aggression at all. There was a horrible case</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.880" end="00:39:26.519" style="s2">about two years ago, where a woman was interacting<br />with a chimp and it tore her to pieces, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.519" end="00:39:32.569" style="s2">they can do that. It took her face right off,<br />and they have about the strength of six men.</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.569" end="00:39:38.210" style="s2">An adult male chimp can break a three hundred<br />pound test cable. Those things are really,</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.210" end="00:39:42.150" style="s2">really strong, and they&#39;re not friendly.</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:50.740" style="s2">So in Arnhem zoo for example, there has been<br />a troop of chimps there that have been followed</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.740" end="00:39:55.549" style="s2">by an extremely brilliant primatologist named<br />Frans de Waal, whose work I would very highly</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.549" end="00:39:59.769" style="s2">recommend. De Waal is a very smart guy, and<br />he&#39;s looked at the origins of morality in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.769" end="00:40:04.380" style="s2">chimpanzees, from you know, a biological perspective.<br />It&#39;s very, very nice work - very, very clear-headed.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.380" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">But you know, he&#39;s recounted absolutely horrific<br />stories about chimpanzee behavior. One of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:15.279" style="s2">the stories he talked about, for example,<br />was you kind of have this idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.279" end="00:40:19.099" style="s2">a male chimp hierarchy. It&#39;s roughly true<br />- there&#39;s a female hierarchy too, but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.099" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">males in the chimp world anyways, tend to<br />be the dominant ones.</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">You know, you kind of think of a dominant<br />primate as a prize fighter. He&#39;s ruling because</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:34.069" style="s2">of his physical prowess. Now that turns out<br />not to exactly be true. In this particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.069" end="00:40:37.970" style="s2">case, the guy who was running the chimp troop<br />was a bit of a bully, and he wasn&#39;t making</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.970" end="00:40:43.210" style="s2">any friends. That&#39;s not such a good idea because<br />no matter how tough you are by yourself, two</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.210" end="00:40:47.309" style="s2">weaker guys can probably take you out, and<br />that&#39;s what happened during Frans de Waal&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.309" end="00:40:47.559" style="s2">observations.</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.559" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">Two chimps attacked the leader. They had a<br />coalition, they were grooming each other,</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:57.930" style="s2">they were pals. And chimps are pretty good<br />at remembering reciprocal relationships, and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.930" end="00:41:02.019" style="s2">having friendships. They have a very highly<br />social structure. They just tore him apart.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.019" end="00:41:05.970" style="s2">The things they did to him, like you don&#39;t<br />even want to know about. So chimps really</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.970" end="00:41:10.589" style="s2">have no upper limit on their capacity for<br />aggression. And when they hunt, because chimps</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.589" end="00:41:15.309" style="s2">hunt, they like meat - they often hunt Colobus<br />monkeys, and they weight about 35 pounds.</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.309" end="00:41:18.990" style="s2">A Colobus monkey is a major league animal,<br />and they eat those things alive. And they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.990" end="00:41:22.999" style="s2">scream while they&#39;re being killed, and that<br />does not slow the chimps down one bit. So</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.999" end="00:41:28.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious the chimp is really a creature<br />of a lot of empathy - especially the males.</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.200" end="00:41:31.960" style="s2">The females are likely more empathetic because<br />they have to deal with infants for long periods</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.960" end="00:41:38.650" style="s2">of time. What seems to inhibit the aggression<br />of male chimps isn&#39;t anything they hold internally.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.650" end="00:41:42.499" style="s2">It seems that when they get hyper aggressive<br />in the troop, the troop gets more and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.499" end="00:41:46.740" style="s2">agitated and basically shuts them down. So<br />you can imagine maybe you&#39;re in a rough bar,</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.740" end="00:41:51.559" style="s2">and some dingbat who&#39;s half-psychopathic and<br />has had two pints of alcohol, is starting</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.559" end="00:41:55.740" style="s2">to cause a tremendous amount of trouble. He&#39;s<br />not going to shut himself down, but the rest</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.740" end="00:42:00.849" style="s2">of the troop might. And that kind of means<br />the control over the aggression is externalized.</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.849" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">It&#39;s not a consequence of superego control.<br />We like to think that we control our own aggression,</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:11.980" style="s2">but I&#39;m not so sure about that.<br />If you read things like - there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.980" end="00:42:16.609" style="s2">book, a horrifying book published about twenty<br />years ago called the Rape of Nanking,</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.609" end="00:42:21.349" style="s2">which is - the woman who wrote it committed<br />suicide and that suffices to tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.349" end="00:42:26.289" style="s2">the Rape of Nanking was all about. It&#39;s a<br />story about the Japanese in WW2 going into</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.289" end="00:42:31.799" style="s2">a Chinese city called Nanking where, I believe,<br />about 350,000 people were killed.</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.799" end="00:42:36.210" style="s2">The Nazis in that story were the good guys,<br />so you can imagine the kind of brutality that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.210" end="00:42:42.499" style="s2">was going on there. But, there&#39;s absolutely,<br />perfectly well documented evidence that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.499" end="00:42:49.170" style="s2">Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive brutality.<br />So really what happened was the Japanese had</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.170" end="00:42:54.210" style="s2">been pretty militarized by World War II, and<br />they adopted a Prussian education system.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.210" end="00:43:01.579" style="s2">The Prussians and Germans, pre 20th century<br />Germans, were basically interested in educating</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.579" end="00:43:07.099" style="s2">obedient soldiers because it was a militaristic<br />culture. The Japanese kind of adopted that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.099" end="00:43:10.769" style="s2">because they were pretty sick of being kicked<br />around by the Europeans - pretty successfully</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.769" end="00:43:15.130" style="s2">because they defeated the Russians in the<br />early stages of the 20th century.</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.130" end="00:43:19.720" style="s2">It was quite a shock to everyone in Europe,<br />and a cause for great celebration in Japan.</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.720" end="00:43:24.059" style="s2">Anyways, they militarized the hell out of<br />their young men, and taught them basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.059" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">that the Japanese were a master race, and<br />that other people were subhuman. It&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:34.440" style="s2">common human way of thinking, by the way.<br />I would say it&#39;s really the default way human</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.440" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">tribes think about other tribes. I mean, it&#39;s<br />a little more complicated than that because</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:43.450" style="s2">human tribes tend to trade with other tribes.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.450" end="00:43:47.789" style="s2">So it&#39;s not all demonization, but a lot of<br />it is. If you look around the world in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.789" end="00:43:53.269" style="s2">anthropological literature, what you see is<br />that the names that most tribes have for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.269" end="00:43:58.680" style="s2">is something like The Human Beings, or The<br />People, indicating that the rest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.680" end="00:44:03.029" style="s2">aren&#39;t really people. They&#39;re barbarians,<br />or you know. They live out where the sun is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.029" end="00:44:09.660" style="s2">being eaten by the dragon of the night. The<br />word barbarian is a word that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.660" end="00:44:14.650" style="s2">Greeks making fun of how non-Greeks spoke.<br />They thought they went bar bar bar bar</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.650" end="00:44:20.539" style="s2">bar, something like that. So anyways, what<br />Goodall found was that the chimps - the chimp</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.539" end="00:44:26.019" style="s2">adolescents in particular, particularly the<br />males - would patrol the borders of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.019" end="00:44:31.999" style="s2">territory in groups of three or four, often<br />with a female or two. But the females didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.999" end="00:44:38.829" style="s2">seem to be really the - they were more part<br />of the group rather than the initiators. But</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.829" end="00:44:42.759" style="s2">what the chimps would do is if they found<br />a chimp from another troop, even if that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.759" end="00:44:47.809" style="s2">a chimp that had moved from their troop in<br />the not too distant past and joined another,</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.809" end="00:44:51.660" style="s2">cause sometimes the males leave and they go<br />to other troops. If they outnumbered them,</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.660" end="00:44:53.940" style="s2">they would tear them to pieces.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.940" end="00:44:58.809" style="s2">It looked like that was why they were doing<br />the border patrol. They&#39;re out looking for</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.809" end="00:45:01.930" style="s2">trouble. They&#39;re gangs, roughly speaking,<br />and they were looking for trouble. But the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.930" end="00:45:06.619" style="s2">point of it is that - and they would only<br />attack if they outnumbered because chimps</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.619" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">can, I wouldn&#39;t say they can count, but they<br />have a rudimentary notion of group size.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.789" end="00:45:18.269" style="s2">i don&#39;t think you can count without being able<br />to verbalize, but you can estimate at a glance.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.269" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">So when I say tear apart, that&#39;s exactly what<br />I mean. There&#39;s no upper limit on the brutality.</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">So Goodall discovered that first, and she<br />didn&#39;t tell anybody about it. Now she had</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.249" end="00:45:35.658" style="s2">a reason. Some of them might think we&#39;re ideological<br />- oh the lovely chimps, and fair enough. But</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.999" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">some of it was also that she thought that<br />maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">of their contact with human beings and their<br />natural behavior had been somehow transformed.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">And that&#39;s not - it&#39;s reasonable to be cautious<br />as a scientist before you go out and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:57.249" style="s2">chimps go to war. Isn&#39;t that revolutionary,<br />because it is. It just ends the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.249" end="00:46:01.019" style="s2">our war-like, malevolent nature is just a<br />function of culture.</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.019" end="00:46:06.279" style="s2">Like if chimps do it, well what are they perverted<br />by their own culture? I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.279" end="00:46:11.099" style="s2">I mean there are more and less violent chimp<br />cultures, and there&#39;s more and less violent</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.099" end="00:46:16.650" style="s2">baboon cultures. There&#39;s some culture variance,<br />but since Goodall&#39;s time, this sort of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.650" end="00:46:23.109" style="s2">has been documented on many, many chimp troops.<br />So that&#39;s us, in a nutshell. It&#39;s not self</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.109" end="00:46:29.819" style="s2">evident if you put the typical adolescent<br />male, who&#39;s not a very well formulated personality,</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.819" end="00:46:34.769" style="s2">and you know - because he&#39;s not that individual<br />and he hasn&#39;t seen much of the world. The</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.769" end="00:46:39.890" style="s2">typical guy who goes into the army is kind<br />of on the margins of society. Maybe he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.890" end="00:46:45.490" style="s2">particularly bright. I&#39;m not trying to be<br />insulting by that, but it&#39;s not exactly a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.490" end="00:46:47.390" style="s2">high end job.</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:53.190" style="s2">You put someone like that in a place where<br />there&#39;s no rules. It&#39;s like who leads where</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.190" end="00:46:57.490" style="s2">there are no rules? Well the probability that<br />it&#39;s the friendliest and nicest people is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">very, very low. So what seemed to happen in<br />Nanking was the Japanese soldiers took their</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:07.309" style="s2">cues from the people with the most brutal<br />imaginations</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.309" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">People can have pretty brutal imaginations,<br />especially when they start to compete. So,</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:19.960" style="s2">I was interested in that. What exactly was<br />at the core of that malevolence. I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.960" end="00:47:23.910" style="s2">uniquely human. The chimps would go and tear<br />apart, but basically they&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.910" end="00:47:27.890" style="s2">kill them. That&#39;s their goal, and maybe it<br />might take awhile, but it&#39;s not going to take</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:32.950" style="s2">four weeks whereas if you&#39;re a human being,<br />you can draw out your enemy&#39;s death for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.950" end="00:47:38.900" style="s2">very, very long. Part of that is the desire to produce<br />the misery and suffering that&#39;s attended on</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.900" end="00:47:45.640" style="s2">the death. Only human beings have the imagination<br />to do that. That&#39;s why I think in the book</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.640" end="00:47:51.890" style="s2">of Genesis where people&#39;s eyes are open and<br />they become self conscious, they also learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.890" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">the difference between good and evil. Once<br />your eyes are open and you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:00.749" style="s2">like, once you know you&#39;re naked and vulnerable,<br />you can exploit that in other people.</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.749" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">Only human beings have that kind of knowledge.<br />So the fact that we know we can be hurt makes</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:10.440" style="s2">us particularly dangerous because if I know<br />how I can be hurt, I sure know how you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.440" end="00:48:17.749" style="s2">be hurt. So it&#39;s a nasty situation. I&#39;m kind<br />of interested in the motivation for that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.749" end="00:48:23.180" style="s2">You look at the Columbine kids, for example,<br />and the mayhem they produced was trivial to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.180" end="00:48:27.329" style="s2">the mayhem they were planning. If it was up<br />to those two guys, they would have bombed</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.329" end="00:48:33.140" style="s2">Detroit flat. They had visions of exactly<br />that. And it was a media spectacular, and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.140" end="00:48:39.650" style="s2">they didnt do it because they were poor kids<br />in some sense who were bullied. That is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.650" end="00:48:45.009" style="s2">idiotic explanation. It&#39;s not true. Everybody<br />is a bloody outsider. I&#39;m sure there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.009" end="00:48:49.089" style="s2">a single one of you who doesn&#39;t have a memory<br />from junior high where you were an outcast</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.089" end="00:48:52.859" style="s2">in one way or another. Maybe some of you weren&#39;t,<br />but it&#39;s very, very common.</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.859" end="00:48:57.910" style="s2">To think of that as sufficient motivation<br />to shoot people cold bloodedly in a high school</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.910" end="00:49:03.239" style="s2">- sorry, that&#39;s a little on the naive side.<br />So I&#39;m very, very interested in what makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.239" end="00:49:10.380" style="s2">up that motivation because malevolence plus<br />nuclear weapons isn&#39;t a very good combination.</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.380" end="00:49:15.319" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t look to me that we can afford that<br />unconscious malevolence anymore because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.319" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">just too powerful, and if the wrong person<br />ends up being like that with the wrong weapons,</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like game over. I&#39;ve also become convinced<br />while I&#39;d been looking through this that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:32.410" style="s2">problem that we&#39;re discussing is not a sociological<br />problem, or a political problem, or an economic</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.410" end="00:49:35.940" style="s2">problem because a lot of what you read - and<br />a lot of political scientists will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.940" end="00:49:39.319" style="s2">this sort of thing because they&#39;re basically<br />closet Marxists - is that they&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.319" end="00:49:45.130" style="s2">the reason for struggle between nations is<br />economic.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.130" end="00:49:50.390" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absurd, not because it isn&#39;t<br />true, but because it doesn&#39;t actually address</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.390" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">a more fundamental issue which is okay, economic<br />struggle is a struggle about who has access</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:03.079" style="s2">to what&#39;s valued. But, there&#39;s nothing self<br />evident about what&#39;s value. That&#39;s the problem.</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.079" end="00:50:11.962" style="s2">It&#39;s like you have the idea of natural resource.<br />Oil is not a natural resource until you have an automobile.</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.249" end="00:50:18.039" style="s2">The interplay between cultural value structures<br />and what constitutes a natural resource is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.039" end="00:50:24.180" style="s2">so tightly put together - except for maybe<br />air and water - that saying there are natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.180" end="00:50:28.859" style="s2">resources which means things of intrinsic<br />value, and that&#39;s what people fight over.</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.859" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">Well, you&#39;ve made the mystery disappear inside<br />the word natural resource. You haven&#39;t solved</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:41.309" style="s2">anything. Well the question is why would people<br />fight over things that they value? Well because</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.309" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things you can value,<br />like peace. So, it&#39;s not a sufficient explanation</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:54.289" style="s2">and it&#39;s also not clear to me people&#39;s primary<br />motivations are economic.</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.289" end="00:50:59.369" style="s2">Well it&#39;s not trivial, but I would say the<br />motivation isn&#39;t really economic. It&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.369" end="00:51:04.509" style="s2">related to dominance hierarchy position, and<br />that&#39;s fundamentally a sexual motivation especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.509" end="00:51:08.999" style="s2">for men because if men are higher up the<br />dominance hierarchy, women are more attracted</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.999" end="00:51:16.289" style="s2">to them. So you could say that&#39;s economic.<br />I don&#39;t think it is. Economic is just a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.289" end="00:51:21.039" style="s2">consequence of that. I don&#39;t believe, by the<br />way, that&#39;s a theory because there&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.039" end="00:51:26.369" style="s2">documentation on hyper aggression in adolescent<br />males, and the best evidence suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.369" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">adolescent males become hyper aggressive when<br />you put them in situations where they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:34.430" style="s2">win. Then they become hyper aggressive and<br />attempt to formulate a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.430" end="00:51:38.420" style="s2">so that some of them can rise to the top and<br />basically be attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.420" end="00:51:43.489" style="s2">So you can call that economic if you want,<br />but I think you&#39;re pushing your luck with</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.489" end="00:51:56.910" style="s2">that sort of explanation. Well, so that&#39;s<br />basically the background. So, when I was investigating</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.910" end="00:52:01.140" style="s2">this, I first started studying political science<br />and I actually liked that quite a bit in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.140" end="00:52:04.999" style="s2">first couple years because I was basically<br />reading political philosophy. It&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.999" end="00:52:11.239" style="s2">worthwhile reading great political philosophers<br />because A - they could think - and B - you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.239" end="00:52:16.089" style="s2">think like they think even if you don&#39;t know<br />it because one of the hallmarks of a great</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.089" end="00:52:23.539" style="s2">philosopher is that his ideas or her ideas<br />sink into the culture so deeply that a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.539" end="00:52:27.789" style="s2">years after they were written, they think<br />they&#39;ve always thought that way.</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.789" end="00:52:31.210" style="s2">That&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s happened to<br />Freud. One of the things people understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.210" end="00:52:39.099" style="s2">is that theres an unconscious and that&#39;s its<br />motivated by sexual drive. It&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.099" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">so brilliant about that? Yeah, well it&#39;s obvious<br />once Freud points it out. So anyways, I started</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">- I took political science and literature<br />which I also found was extremely useful because</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:09.640" style="s2">great literary people have great things to<br />say. Like Dostoevsky&#39;s novels absolutely flatten</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.640" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">me. He&#39;s so brilliant and I&#39;ve never read<br />anyone who takes moral question so seriously.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:20.440" style="s2">For example, if you look at Crime and Punishment,<br />which is a book I would highly recommend,</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.440" end="00:53:27.160" style="s2">Dostoevsky is an absolute model of a true<br />intellectual. I say that because in Crime</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.160" end="00:53:33.529" style="s2">and Punishment, for example, Dostoevsky had<br />this character named Raskolnikov, and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.529" end="00:53:38.230" style="s2">guys can identify with Raskolnikov because<br />he&#39;s a university student and he&#39;s your age.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.230" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">Now he&#39;s having a rough time because he&#39;s<br />in St. Petersburg and he doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:46.460" style="s2">money and he lives in this tiny little room<br />which basically has a bunch of clothes on</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.460" end="00:53:48.920" style="s2">the bed which he sleeps in, and he&#39;s basically<br />starving to death.</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.920" end="00:53:53.670" style="s2">He only has bread to eat, and he&#39;s a law student.<br />So he&#39;s having a rough time. St. Petersburg</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.670" end="00:53:58.809" style="s2">at the end of the 19th century is kind of<br />a rough place. Some of you guys probably have</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.809" end="00:54:03.269" style="s2">it pretty bad, but Raskolnikov kind of had<br />it pretty bad. And so, he&#39;s half starved and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.269" end="00:54:10.170" style="s2">half delirious. Also, his ideas are very addled<br />because he&#39;s one of the first Russians who</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.170" end="00:54:18.349" style="s2">really considered himself an Atheist. Russia<br />was a medieval society until the late 1900&#39;s.</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.349" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">It was sort of like Quebec before 1960.</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:22.759" style="s2">[Students&#39; laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.759" end="00:54:27.140" style="s2">I&#39;m serious about that, because Quebec was<br />basically the last European country, so to</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.140" end="00:54:32.539" style="s2">speak, that underwent a secularization, and<br />that happened in about 1960. Quebec families</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.539" end="00:54:37.739" style="s2">went from an average size of about 12 to 13<br />to about 1.2. Lowest birth rate in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.739" end="00:54:41.309" style="s2">And all the Quebecois were married, and none<br />of them are now, and they were all Catholic,</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.309" end="00:54:46.239" style="s2">hardly any of them are now. It was an overnight<br />transformation. That&#39;s partly what fed Quebec</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.239" end="00:54:52.890" style="s2">nationalism. There was actually a study that<br />was released by the Gallup organization. I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.890" end="00:54:58.430" style="s2">only heard it referred to in one meeting where<br />they indicated if you were a lapsed Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.430" end="00:55:03.970" style="s2">in Quebec, you were ten times more likely<br />to be a separatist. That&#39;s really worth thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.970" end="00:55:09.009" style="s2">about right, because religion just collapses<br />and nationalism just rises up to take its</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.009" end="00:55:13.109" style="s2">place because you need a bloody belief structure<br />because, what are you gonna do? Wander around</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.109" end="00:55:14.380" style="s2">aimlessly?</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.380" end="00:55:22.210" style="s2">That&#39;s not fun. It&#39;s not useful. So, you just<br />jump from one structure of belief to another,</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.210" end="00:55:28.650" style="s2">or you fall apart. So that&#39;s also something<br />very much worth knowing. Anyways, Raskolnikov,</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.650" end="00:55:32.779" style="s2">he thinks he&#39;s a pretty educated guy and thinks<br />he&#39;s pretty smart, and he is pretty smart</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.779" end="00:55:36.930" style="s2">but he&#39;s like smart arrogant, not smart wise<br />because he&#39;s 21. What the hell does he know?</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.930" end="00:55:41.809" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t know anything, but he&#39;s smart.<br />He&#39;s contemptuous about other people because</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.809" end="00:55:46.450" style="s2">he&#39;s probably smarter than most of them and<br />he confuses that with knowing what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.450" end="00:55:52.900" style="s2">on. He lives in this little horrible apartment,<br />and he has a really horrible landlady - this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.900" end="00:55:58.859" style="s2">is where Dostoevsky is a genius - like Raskolnikov<br />hates his landlady, and Dostoevsky tells you</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.859" end="00:56:07.910" style="s2">why. Then you think well yeah, I&#39;d hate her<br />too. So, she&#39;s miserable. She owns a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.910" end="00:56:10.779" style="s2">of apartments. She charges too much rent for<br />them.</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.779" end="00:56:15.589" style="s2">She tortures all the people that rent from<br />her in every possible way she can. The places</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.589" end="00:56:20.499" style="s2">are filthy. She doesn&#39;t provide any furniture.<br />She hoards money, and doesn&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.499" end="00:56:27.009" style="s2">with it, so she lives in absolute poverty<br />and filth. She&#39;s a cruel person in every possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.009" end="00:56:33.380" style="s2">way. Plus she has a niece who isn&#39;t very bright,<br />and she basically treats her like a slave.</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.380" end="00:56:38.069" style="s2">So, she&#39;s not doing anyone any good. That&#39;s<br />Raskolnikov&#39;s idea. And then, he gets a letter</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.069" end="00:56:43.739" style="s2">from his mother and his mother basically tells<br />him that his sister&#39;s going to go marry this</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.739" end="00:56:49.960" style="s2">rich guy because she&#39;s in love with him, and<br />that&#39;ll solve all of his monetary problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.960" end="00:56:51.390" style="s2">so he could keep going to law school.</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.390" end="00:56:56.569" style="s2">But he reads between the lines and he realizes<br />pretty quickly that this rich guy is a real</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.569" end="00:57:01.489" style="s2">miserly scum rat, and he&#39;s gonna treat his<br />sister and his mother absolutely miserably,</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.489" end="00:57:04.630" style="s2">and his sister doesn&#39;t really love him anyways,<br />and the only reason she was marrying him is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.630" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">so Raskolnikov can go to school. So he&#39;s not<br />very happy with that, and fair enough. You</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.839" end="00:57:15.259" style="s2">can understand his motivation. So he&#39;s starving<br />and he&#39;s full of these ideas and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.259" end="00:57:23.569" style="s2">sort of Nietzschean. Like Atheistic ideas<br />hit Russia really hard because it went from</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.569" end="00:57:29.539" style="s2">seriously orthodox Christian in every possible<br />way to unbelievably skeptical in one generation.</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.539" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">It just fractured the society.</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:35.999" style="s2">It&#39;s partly why Communism became so absolutely<br />attractive for the Russians, and Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.999" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">also details that extremely brilliantly in<br />the book called The Possessed or The Devil&#39;s.</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:45.180" style="s2">It&#39;s a wonderful book. It&#39;s hard to get into,<br />you have to read about 200 pages before it</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.180" end="00:57:52.329" style="s2">really kicks in, but Russian novels are sort<br />of like that. So anyways, Raskolnikov is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.329" end="00:57:57.529" style="s2">these sort of super man-ish, rationalistic<br />ideas, and he thinks, well you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.529" end="00:58:03.849" style="s2">no evidence that there&#39;s any real moral hierarchy.<br />And you can easily make a case that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.849" end="00:58:08.680" style="s2">that people aren&#39;t really moral, they&#39;re just<br />cowardly - and this is a Nietzschean observation.</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.680" end="00:58:11.979" style="s2">Most of what you&#39;d call your morality isn&#39;t<br />morality at all. It&#39;s just you&#39;re too afraid</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.979" end="00:58:16.489" style="s2">to do what you want, and because you&#39;re too<br />weasly to admit that, you say you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.489" end="00:58:19.380" style="s2">those things because it isn&#39;t moral. But it<br />isn&#39;t true.</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.380" end="00:58:24.479" style="s2">You&#39;d love to do them if you were brave enough,<br />but you aren&#39;t. So people misread that to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.479" end="00:58:28.940" style="s2">say what Nietzsche thought that all morality<br />was cowardice. That isn&#39;t what he thought.</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.940" end="00:58:35.059" style="s2">He thought all cowardice masqueraded as morality.<br />That&#39;s a whole different thing. So anyways,</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.059" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">Raskolnikov is thinking about these things.<br />He&#39;s thinking, well I can be lawyer. I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:44.890" style="s2">be a good one. I&#39;d help people. I&#39;d help the<br />poor people. What the hell good is it for</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.890" end="00:58:49.569" style="s2">me to wander around starving like this. It<br />doesn&#39;t seem reasonable. My sister&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.569" end="00:58:55.210" style="s2">going to go prostitute herself for this rich<br />guy, and that sucks. There&#39;s my landlady and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.210" end="00:59:00.660" style="s2">she&#39;s an absolutely reprehensible creature<br />and everyone agrees, and she&#39;s old and worn</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.660" end="00:59:08.450" style="s2">out. And she has this person she keeps as<br />a slave. Maybe I should just get rid of her.</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.450" end="00:59:17.249" style="s2">What I love about that is that - like this<br />happens almost all the time in universities,</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.249" end="00:59:21.650" style="s2">I would say. Whenever you hear people who<br />think they&#39;re smart having a discussion. What</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.650" end="00:59:26.529" style="s2">they generally do is that they have an idea,<br />and then they have an idea about the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.529" end="00:59:31.619" style="s2">who has a different idea. The idea about the<br />person who has the different idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.619" end="00:59:37.999" style="s2">their idea is stupid. So what they do is produce<br />a caricature of that person&#39;s idea, and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.999" end="00:59:43.579" style="s2">they blast it. Then they think, wow I&#39;ve won<br />that argument. Which is really - it&#39;s pathetic.</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.579" end="00:59:48.049" style="s2">It&#39;s a strawman argument. It&#39;s a sign of a<br />weak mind. What you do if you really want</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.049" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">to have an argument with someone is you help<br />them. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a right winger and</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.650" end="00:59:55.489" style="s2">you&#39;re arguing with a left winger, or you&#39;re<br />left winger and you&#39;re arguing with a right</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.489" end="01:00:02.239" style="s2">winger. It&#39;s like, you want to make their<br />argument as magnificent as you possibly can,</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.239" end="01:00:05.729" style="s2">and then see if you can undermine it.</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.729" end="01:00:11.420" style="s2">That&#39;s what you do because then you&#39;re getting<br />somewhere. Like any idiot can make a strawman</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.420" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">and light it. Dostoevsky never does that.<br />He makes the people - like when he sets up</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:24.729" style="s2">two ideas to go to war, he embodies both sets<br />of ideas in the most powerful characters he</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.729" end="01:00:30.930" style="s2">can imagine. So in The Brothers Karamazov,<br />for example, the two people, the two protagonists</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.930" end="01:00:34.200" style="s2">basically - there&#39;s a bunch of them - but<br />basically one of them is named Ilyusha, and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.200" end="01:00:39.140" style="s2">the other is named Ivan. And Ilyusha is kind<br />of an innocent guy. A good guy fundamentally,</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.140" end="01:00:44.950" style="s2">a little on the naive side. Religious, but<br />not in the way that he can defend. It&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.950" end="01:00:49.410" style="s2">like a natural expression spirit, and he&#39;s<br />in a monastery, and he&#39;s a follower of this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.410" end="01:00:59.940" style="s2">famous monk. He&#39;s kind of into Orthodox Christianity<br />in his benevolent and sincere way. But he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.940" end="01:01:01.970" style="s2">not much of an intellect.</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.970" end="01:01:05.849" style="s2">And Ivan, his older brother, he&#39;s good looking<br />and tall. I believe he&#39;s a soldier. He&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.849" end="01:01:12.430" style="s2">impressive guy, and he&#39;s got a viciously cutting<br />intellect. He just tears Ilyusha apart every</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.430" end="01:01:17.170" style="s2">chance he gets, across the whole book. You<br />can see two parts of Dostoevsky fighting it</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.170" end="01:01:22.609" style="s2">out in the book because part of Dostoevsky<br />was highly spiritualized, not least because</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.609" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">he was epileptic and that often - for reasons<br />we&#39;ll talk about later - that often exaggerates</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:35.109" style="s2">spirituality. Also because he was a deeply<br />spiritual person and also a tremendous intellect.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.109" end="01:01:40.499" style="s2">And so, he was at war inside and he put those<br />parts of him out into these characters, and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.499" end="01:01:46.279" style="s2">let them just go at it. It&#39;s brilliant, you<br />know. Ivan makes the best argument for Atheism</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.279" end="01:01:52.989" style="s2">that&#39;s ever been written. It&#39;s really powerful.<br />He talks about all these terrible things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.989" end="01:01:57.759" style="s2">were being done to children in Russia at the<br />turn of the century, back in the late 1800&#39;s.</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.759" end="01:02:03.960" style="s2">He talks about this one situation where the<br />parents of this one girl locked her in a freezing</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.960" end="01:02:08.910" style="s2">outhouse overnight. She was crying and screaming,<br />and telling them that she was sorry. And they</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.910" end="01:02:13.609" style="s2">just left her in there and she froze to death.<br />It was like front page news in Russia at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.609" end="01:02:19.619" style="s2">time, maybe in Moscow, or maybe in St. Petersburg.<br />Dostoevsky lifted that argument and he said</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.619" end="01:02:27.400" style="s2">to - he had Ivan ask Ilyusha, well this is<br />the sort of thing God permits? He said the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.400" end="01:02:31.479" style="s2">whole damn world isn&#39;t worth that. The suffering<br />of one child in a situation like that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.479" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">How can you possibly see that something like<br />that can exist and wander around with your</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.839" end="01:02:41.900" style="s2">boneheaded belief and a benevolent god? Would<br />you lock a girl in an outhouse and let her</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.900" end="01:02:46.719" style="s2">freeze? If that meant other people would be<br />happy? And of course Ilyusha says, no I would</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.719" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">never do that. So Ivan tells him that, yeah<br />you wouldn&#39;t do that but this god you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:58.059" style="s2">exists would be perfectly pleased to let something<br />like that occur. And you know Ilyusha has</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.059" end="01:03:02.979" style="s2">no idea what to say about that. That&#39;s just<br />a fragment of Ivan&#39;s argument. He&#39;s like punching</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.979" end="01:03:09.539" style="s2">at him like mad. I think the way Ilyusha basically<br />responds is by trying to live a good life.</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.539" end="01:03:18.700" style="s2">He can&#39;t argue. Ivan&#39;s better at it than he<br />is, plus there&#39;s this vicious strain of critical</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.700" end="01:03:22.680" style="s2">thinking about religion that&#39;s being wafted<br />in from Western Europe.</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.680" end="01:03:27.940" style="s2">There&#39;s 300 years of philosophical force behind<br />it, and Ivan is its mouthpiece. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.940" end="01:03:33.960" style="s2">Ilyusha and Russia itself is just blown apart<br />by that. They have no defense against that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.960" end="01:03:38.710" style="s2">The bloody Western Europeans had 300 years<br />to get used to it. The Russians had like ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.710" end="01:03:45.079" style="s2">years. It just fragmented them. They were<br />like waiting for the new Messiah, and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.079" end="01:03:52.680" style="s2">sure got one. Both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche<br />prophesied about what happened to Russia forty</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.680" end="01:03:59.109" style="s2">years before it happened. That&#39;s bloody amazing.<br />To think you could look that far into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.109" end="01:04:02.759" style="s2">future and actually get it right. I mean,<br />things didn&#39;t change quite as fast there as</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.759" end="01:04:08.170" style="s2">they are now, but you know, it wasn&#39;t like<br />the Victoria times were static. There were</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.170" end="01:04:12.910" style="s2">a lot of things going on. To get that right<br />over four decades - those guys were in touch</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.910" end="01:04:21.670" style="s2">with something very deep that was going on<br />underneath the substrata of Western civilization.</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.670" end="01:04:29.539" style="s2">Alright, so I&#39;m thinking about belief structures<br />and I&#39;m thinking about malevolence and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.539" end="01:04:37.479" style="s2">think about the psychological role that these<br />sorts of things are playing because it occurred</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.479" end="01:04:43.140" style="s2">to me at some point, something like - an idea<br />something like this. This actually tormented</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.140" end="01:04:47.150" style="s2">me for about six months. I would say, when<br />I had been thinking these things through - I</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.150" end="01:04:51.109" style="s2">would say about five years at this point - I<br />was really obsessed by it. I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.109" end="01:04:56.109" style="s2">about this literally every minute of the day,<br />from the time I woke up till the time I went</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.109" end="01:05:04.579" style="s2">to sleep. It was really manic, probably. At<br />one point I got to this conclusion. I thought,</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.579" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">okay well here&#39;s the situation. It&#39;s pretty<br />obvious that people need belief structures</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:15.029" style="s2">because first of all a belief structure orients<br />them to action so you have to believe that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.029" end="01:05:17.799" style="s2">one thing is more valuable than other to just<br />act.</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.799" end="01:05:22.460" style="s2">So, why did the chicken cross the road? Well<br />because he thought the other side of the road</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.460" end="01:05:24.489" style="s2">was better than the side he was on, obviously.</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.489" end="01:05:25.140" style="s2">[Students&#39; laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.140" end="01:05:30.930" style="s2">You know, because whenever you&#39;re moving,<br />the implicit hypothesis of your movement is</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.930" end="01:05:34.950" style="s2">that the thing you&#39;re moving towards is better<br />than the thing you&#39;re leaving, unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.950" end="01:05:39.369" style="s2">self destructive because otherwise, why bother?<br />So what that means is that you don&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.369" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">without a value structure, and you don&#39;t get<br />to not have one. You might say, well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:50.619" style="s2">believe in anything. It&#39;s like, well, you<br />say you don&#39;t believe in anything, so technically</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.619" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t make an argument for what you believe<br />or you don&#39;t know what you believe. But if</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:02.299" style="s2">you&#39;re not just sitting there, vegetating,<br />then you believe something otherwise - you</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.299" end="01:06:04.130" style="s2">act it out.</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.130" end="01:06:16.279" style="s2">You have to have a belief system or you fall<br />apart. So you&#39;re nihilistic or depressed or</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.279" end="01:06:22.019" style="s2">hopeless. That&#39;s certainly - like who wants<br />that? That&#39;s not good. It&#39;s painful. Depression</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.019" end="01:06:30.769" style="s2">is no joke. I know someone who had a very<br />serious illness. It was an illness that destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.769" end="01:06:35.539" style="s2">part of this person&#39;s body. It destroyed their<br />joints, and they also had clinical depression.</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.539" end="01:06:40.940" style="s2">I asked this person at one point - okay, you<br />get to have a choice. You get to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.940" end="01:06:44.269" style="s2">the illness that&#39;s destroying your joints,<br />so they had to be replaced, or you could get</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.269" end="01:06:49.400" style="s2">rid of the depression. He said, I&#39;d get rid<br />of the depression first, no problem. So that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.400" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">worth thinking about. If you believe nothing,<br />and you&#39;re hopeless and you&#39;ve got no value</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:58.549" style="s2">structure, the place you end up is not good.<br />And I&#39;m sure lots of you have experienced</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.549" end="01:07:02.650" style="s2">that. I mean most people - especially the<br />people who are more likely to come to this</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.650" end="01:07:08.369" style="s2">class - most people, by the time they&#39;re your<br />age, have gone through a dark period or two</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.369" end="01:07:12.029" style="s2">for whatever reason. Relationship breaks up<br />or maybe you lose the meaning in your life</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.029" end="01:07:16.059" style="s2">or someone betrays you or someone gets sick<br />or you get sick or, you know, some tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.059" end="01:07:20.239" style="s2">comes along and knocks you flat. You think,<br />what the hell, what&#39;s going on? Why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.239" end="01:07:25.469" style="s2">any of this worthwhile? And it&#39;s a good questions,<br />but you can&#39;t go there because that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.469" end="01:07:25.849" style="s2">death.</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.849" end="01:07:30.950" style="s2">Then the other problem is, let&#39;s say you do<br />have a belief system. Alright, so what happens</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.950" end="01:07:36.309" style="s2">if I have a different one? What are we supposed<br />to do about that? You can&#39;t give up yours</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.309" end="01:07:40.969" style="s2">cause then you&#39;re done. I&#39;m not gonna give<br />up mine for the same reason. But it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.969" end="01:07:45.229" style="s2">clear that we can inhabit the same part of<br />the Earth peacefully if we don&#39;t believe the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.229" end="01:07:51.059" style="s2">same things. So I - when I sorted that all<br />out, I thought well that&#39;s it man. We&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.059" end="01:07:54.910" style="s2">- that&#39;s it. We&#39;re done. We can&#39;t not have<br />a belief system, and if you have one, you</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.910" end="01:08:00.259" style="s2">can&#39;t not fight. We&#39;re too well armed to fight<br />now. We&#39;re not just going to collapse into</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.259" end="01:08:07.249" style="s2">nihilism, although that happens quite a bit.<br />So, game&#39;s over. Well, it turned out that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.249" end="01:08:10.910" style="s2">that was wrong, thank god, but it took me<br />an awful long time to even begin to understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.910" end="01:08:16.730" style="s2">how that could possibly be wrong because as<br />far as I could tell, those were the options.</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.730" end="01:08:22.330" style="s2">So another thing we&#39;re gonna try to figure<br />out is not only exactly why people have belief</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.330" end="01:08:27.690" style="s2">systems, exactly what a belief system is,<br />and why they compete, and why you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.690" end="01:08:31.660" style="s2">get rid of them. But, we&#39;re also gonna figure<br />out what it is that you might be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.660" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">about the fact that you&#39;re going to inhabit<br />places with people who don&#39;t have exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:42.020" style="s2">the same belief systems as you. And in some<br />sense, it&#39;s really a problem of social being,</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.020" end="01:08:46.600" style="s2">right? And creatures have been trying to solve<br />this problem ever since, well we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.600" end="01:08:51.660" style="s2">how long. I like to use lobsters as an example<br />because lobsters arrange themselves into dominance</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.660" end="01:08:56.930" style="s2">hierarchies, and they have very complex social<br />behavior. They don&#39;t have much of a brain.</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.930" end="01:09:02.140" style="s2">So you can have pretty damn complex social<br />behavior without having much of a brain. Lobsters</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.140" end="01:09:05.990" style="s2">have been around for around 400 million years.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.990" end="01:09:11.170" style="s2">So us, roughly speaking, since we had a shared<br />ancestor with the lobster a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.170" end="01:09:15.940" style="s2">ago, we&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to<br />coexist with other creatures that don&#39;t precisely</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.940" end="01:09:21.580" style="s2">share our belief systems for 400 million years.<br />And we&#39;ve been sufficiently successful about</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.580" end="01:09:27.020" style="s2">it so that we&#39;re both social, and here we<br />are. So obviously, there&#39;s ways that it can</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.020" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">be dealt with; although I think we don&#39;t necessarily<br />understand them very well. I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:38.350" style="s2">just understand what it was about belief systems,<br />you know, about their necessity and their</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.350" end="01:09:43.390" style="s2">function, and the way the become pathologist.<br />I wanted to figure out if there&#39;s also a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.390" end="01:09:50.710" style="s2">to the processes by which belief systems are<br />modified and negotiated so that belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.710" end="01:09:55.260" style="s2">that have different structures can coexist<br />in the same place peacefully.</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.260" end="01:09:59.290" style="s2">It&#39;s a vital question right? Because most<br />of you are going to get married, successfully</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.290" end="01:10:03.210" style="s2">or unsuccessfully. And even if you don&#39;t,<br />you&#39;re going to live with someone for a long</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.210" end="01:10:06.460" style="s2">period of time, and you&#39;re going to find out<br />they&#39;re not like you, and that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.460" end="01:10:14.030" style="s2">annoying. But, what are you gonna do? You&#39;re<br />either going to be a slave, or a tyrant, or</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.030" end="01:10:18.910" style="s2">you&#39;re going to negotiate because those are<br />your options. And negotiation is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.910" end="01:10:22.700" style="s2">difficult because you have to figure out what<br />you want, and you probably won&#39;t even admit</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.700" end="01:10:27.140" style="s2">it, and second of all you have to listen to<br />your stupid partner about what they want.</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.140" end="01:10:32.780" style="s2">Then you have to try to figure out how to<br />make both of them possible. Well, slavery,</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.780" end="01:10:37.220" style="s2">tyranny; that&#39;s comparatively easy from a<br />cognitive perspective, compared to actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.220" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">trying to figure how you can be mutually satisfied<br />in the same space, but you can do it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:49.290" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing. There is a process, and<br />it&#39;s identifiable. So I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.290" end="01:10:54.660" style="s2">about belief systems and their psychological<br />significance. What they&#39;re like. What function</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.660" end="01:10:59.720" style="s2">they can perform, but I also want to talk<br />to you about how they transform because they</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.720" end="01:11:04.830" style="s2">do right? They change, especially with humans.<br />So they can change - that means they can modify.</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.830" end="01:11:10.730" style="s2">And that means, at least in principle, that<br />we could have a dialogue. Now dialogues, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.730" end="01:11:16.020" style="s2">rough, but the alternative is war. That&#39;s<br />partly why you&#39;re supposed to listen to your</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.020" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">enemy because if you don&#39;t listen to your<br />enemy, the only other thing you can do is</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:23.410" style="s2">fight with them. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.410" end="01:11:31.690" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student asks: You talked about how belief<br />systems can often modify, so they can be close</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.690" end="01:11:35.820" style="s2">together. Isn&#39;t that what political perspectives<br />basically is?]</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.820" end="01:11:41.370" style="s2">&gt;&gt; You mean it&#39;s the desire for that to happen.<br />Well, I would say it&#39;s partly the desire for</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.370" end="01:11:46.940" style="s2">that to happen. Thing is, whenever I look<br />at a political movement, especially an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.940" end="01:11:54.910" style="s2">group, I think okay, there&#39;s a bunch of things<br />you&#39;re for. Fine. What are you against? Because</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.910" end="01:11:58.460" style="s2">one of the things about people that have adopted<br />ideological positions like to presume is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.460" end="01:12:04.580" style="s2">all of the right is on their side. That makes<br />them very unconscious of their shadow, from</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.580" end="01:12:09.870" style="s2">the Jungian perspective. The Nazis had all<br />sorts of positive reasons for what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.870" end="01:12:14.540" style="s2">doing, but the negative reasons were there<br />too, and you could easily make it a case that</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.540" end="01:12:16.910" style="s2">the negative reasons were really the reasons.</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.910" end="01:12:22.270" style="s2">When I look at ideologues, I always think,<br />yeah yeah that&#39;s what you&#39;re for, but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.270" end="01:12:26.290" style="s2">really think all the good people are on your<br />side. And B - I know that negative motivations</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.290" end="01:12:31.050" style="s2">are more powerful than positive ones. So you<br />say you&#39;re for things, but you&#39;re against</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.050" end="01:12:37.650" style="s2">them too, so let&#39;s start with that. I started<br />thinking about this after I&#39;d read George</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.650" end="01:12:43.340" style="s2">Orwell. I love George Orwell, by the way.<br />How many of you know who George Orwell is?</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.340" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">Wow, really? That&#39;s impressive. How many don&#39;t?<br />Okay, well that&#39;s good. That&#39;s amazing. How</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:55.510" style="s2">the hell did you learn about George Orwell?<br />Is it 1984? Animal Farm?</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.510" end="01:12:57.260" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Students answer: Animal Farm.]</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.260" end="01:13:01.730" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Okay, okay, well that&#39;s good because George<br />Orwell - I tell you - George Orwell was the</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.730" end="01:13:06.860" style="s2">first Western intellectual who figured out<br />what the hell was going on in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.860" end="01:13:13.250" style="s2">And he did that in the mid forties, early.<br />It was complicated because we sort of knew</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.250" end="01:13:16.650" style="s2">what was happening in the twenties and the<br />thirties. There was Lenin, and that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.650" end="01:13:21.670" style="s2">so good. There was the Russian civil war.<br />There was the idea of universal Communism,</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.670" end="01:13:25.350" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t such a good idea, for as far as<br />people who didn&#39;t want to become Communists</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.350" end="01:13:30.570" style="s2">were concerned. And then there was what happened<br />in the Ukraine in the 1930&#39;s. The evidence</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.570" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">was starting to pile up, but unfortunately<br />what happened was the Spanish Civil War, and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:41.080" style="s2">the lefties were pretty much the good guys<br />in the Spanish Civil War. It was like a microcosm</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.080" end="01:13:46.590" style="s2">of the second world war. The lefties were<br />fighting the fascists, and some of the lefties</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.590" end="01:13:51.980" style="s2">were Communists, but some of them, I think,<br />were people genuinely fighting for freedom.</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.980" end="01:13:59.030" style="s2">A lot of North American literary figures went<br />to Spain to fight on the side of the - against</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.030" end="01:14:08.270" style="s2">the fascists. And so fair enough, the fascists<br />were obviously reprehensible, clearly. So</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.270" end="01:14:12.330" style="s2">that kind of muddied the water, right, because<br />the fascists were bad and that sort of means</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.330" end="01:14:16.540" style="s2">the people that are fighting them are good,<br />and some of them are Communists. There was</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.540" end="01:14:21.930" style="s2">pretty good reason for people to be radically<br />socialist at that point in human history because</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.930" end="01:14:27.180" style="s2">the plight of the working man was relatively<br />unpleasant. George Orwell wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.180" end="01:14:33.260" style="s2">The Road to Wigan Pier, and he went<br />up to this town, that was a coal mining town</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.260" end="01:14:41.930" style="s2">and just looked at their life. So here&#39;s part<br />of their life. So, you basically work a seven</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.930" end="01:14:45.980" style="s2">and a half hour shift when you&#39;re a coal miner,<br />and you think oh that&#39;s not too bad by 1930</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.980" end="01:14:54.090" style="s2">standards, and it&#39;s like yeah except you have<br />to go down to the coal mine tunnels and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.090" end="01:15:00.350" style="s2">not eight feet high and carpeted. They&#39;re<br />like four and a half feet high and rough,</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.350" end="01:15:06.930" style="s2">and poorly lit, and the air is terrible. So<br />basically, you have to chimp walk or crawl,</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.930" end="01:15:13.440" style="s2">up to three miles, just to get to work. And<br />then you&#39;d have to do that at end of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.440" end="01:15:18.520" style="s2">shift, and you don&#39;t get paid for that. That&#39;s<br />just your commute.</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.520" end="01:15:24.600" style="s2">Then of course what you&#39;re doing when you<br />get there is it&#39;s absolutely filthy. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.600" end="01:15:32.280" style="s2">unbelievably noisy and brutally difficult.<br />Coal miners, they had no teeth, but their</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.280" end="01:15:36.990" style="s2">bodies were absolutely perfect. They were<br />unbelievably powerful and strong because all</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.990" end="01:15:42.680" style="s2">they did was incredibly intense physical labor.<br />It was bloody rough. And the housing most</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.680" end="01:15:49.500" style="s2">people had, it&#39;s like fifty families for one<br />outhouse. That&#39;s probably good enough to describe</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.500" end="01:15:55.750" style="s2">it. Often they were row houses, and the row<br />houses had no back doors. They had no paths</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.750" end="01:16:00.020" style="s2">between them, and all the outhouses were at<br />the back. So, that meant if it was twenty</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.020" end="01:16:02.960" style="s2">below and it was the winter, and you were<br />sick then you&#39;d get to go all the way around</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.960" end="01:16:06.430" style="s2">your block to get to the damn outhouse and<br />maybe there was only one there, and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.430" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2">line up with fifty people so that - you know.<br />Orwell, he was an upper class guy basically,</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.000" end="01:16:20.670" style="s2">and he was trying to help himself overcome<br />his upper class prejudices. He was a real,</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.670" end="01:16:25.620" style="s2">documentarian of the terrible working conditions<br />of working class people.</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.620" end="01:16:29.670" style="s2">He wrote this book called Road to Wigan<br />Pier but one of the things that Orwell</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.670" end="01:16:36.270" style="s2">said - he wrote this story about these poor<br />god damn coal miners, it&#39;s like yeah how about</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.270" end="01:16:41.190" style="s2">some social legislation so that these people<br />and their children aren&#39;t absolutely brutalized</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.190" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">nonstop. But then he wrote the last half of<br />the book and he wrote it for the Left Book</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">Club which was a socialist group that would<br />publish a book every month or so. What he</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:57.040" style="s2">did was, he wrote a critique of socialism<br />- of British socialism, and he said yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.040" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">sucks man. It&#39;s like we should be on the side<br />of the working people, but the socialists</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.080" end="01:17:05.980" style="s2">I meet, they&#39;re not on the side of the working<br />people. They&#39;re like tweed wearing middle</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.980" end="01:17:10.850" style="s2">class hyper intellectuals who never go anywhere<br />near the working class because of their class</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.850" end="01:17:12.910" style="s2">prejudices and for all sorts of other reasons.</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.910" end="01:17:18.420" style="s2">And they don&#39;t like the poor at all, they<br />just hate the rich. I thought - I had been</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.420" end="01:17:21.500" style="s2">a member of the NDP for a long time at that<br />point and there&#39;s always something a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.500" end="01:17:27.640" style="s2">off about it, especially the radical end like<br />what&#39;s with you guys? It doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.640" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">benevolence as far as I can tell. There&#39;s<br />a lot of whining and complaining and resentment.</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:41.440" style="s2">What&#39;s that about? I read Orwell, and I thought<br />aha! Right. If you hate the successful, if</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.440" end="01:17:44.540" style="s2">you hate the rich - rich by the way is whoever<br />has more money than you, but that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.540" end="01:17:51.890" style="s2">define rich - and the best way to mask your<br />resentment is to pretend you&#39;re on the side</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.890" end="01:17:58.020" style="s2">of poor. And I read that and thought, that&#39;s<br />exactly right. That&#39;s also what made me psychoanalytically</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.020" end="01:18:05.560" style="s2">oriented because one thing psychoanalysts<br />always do, always, is if you say you&#39;re - here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.560" end="01:18:12.770" style="s2">how I&#39;m positively predisposed, the psychoanalyst<br />says, how are you using that to mask something</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.770" end="01:18:21.260" style="s2">easy and malevolent you&#39;re doing? And that&#39;s<br />a very very useful question. It&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.260" end="01:18:25.220" style="s2">correct, but it&#39;s correct a lot more than<br />people generally like to think.</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.220" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s like the mother - or the witch<br />- in Hansel and Gretel. You know this story</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:35.770" style="s2">right? This guy gets married. He&#39;s got a couple<br />of kids, and his new wife doesn&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.770" end="01:18:42.060" style="s2">the kids. You have a hundred times higher<br />chance, by the way, of being abused by a stepparent</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.060" end="01:18:47.110" style="s2">than by a biological parent - just so you<br />know. So the stepmother doesn&#39;t like the kids.</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.110" end="01:18:50.040" style="s2">She tells the guy, well why don&#39;t you just<br />put those kids out in the woods. So out they</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.040" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">go, out in the woods. So they&#39;re lost kids,<br />right, they have nowhere to go. So they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:19:01.390" style="s2">wandering out there in the forest. What happens?<br />They come across a gingerbread house. You</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.390" end="01:19:07.390" style="s2">think wow, you&#39;re a starving kid. Gingerbread<br />house, that&#39;s good news right. Not only is</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.390" end="01:19:14.010" style="s2">it a house, but it&#39;s made out of candy! How<br />could anything be possibly any better? So</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.010" end="01:19:20.410" style="s2">in they go. Well and then there&#39;s this grandmotherly<br />type there and she starts to fatten them up.</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.410" end="01:19:26.350" style="s2">She puts, I think it&#39;s Hansel, in a cage.<br />She gets Gretel, after a while, to basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.350" end="01:19:30.060" style="s2">work as their scullery maid and it becomes<br />quite obvious to the children that she&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.060" end="01:19:33.330" style="s2">fattening them up so she can put them in the<br />oven and eat them.</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.330" end="01:19:37.730" style="s2">And so, I think what Hansel does is I think<br />Gretel gives him like this bone from some</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.730" end="01:19:42.500" style="s2">animal and the old witch is half blind, and<br />every time she reaches in to sort of reach</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.500" end="01:19:47.860" style="s2">his leg, he gives her the bone and so she&#39;s<br />just not all that interested in eating him.</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.860" end="01:19:50.980" style="s2">Anyway, the kids end up pushing her in the<br />oven and closing it, and getting the hell</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.980" end="01:19:55.490" style="s2">out of there. So you know it&#39;s a happy ending,<br />as far as fairy tales go. But it&#39;s an Oedipal</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.490" end="01:20:02.260" style="s2">story, right? It&#39;s a classic story, but an<br />Oedipal family. Be bloody wary of people who</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.260" end="01:20:09.480" style="s2">do too much for you. Right. It&#39;s like if you<br />have a mother, or any other relative for that</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.480" end="01:20:17.800" style="s2">matter who&#39;s fattening you up on mercy and<br />candy, the probability that her basic goal</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.800" end="01:20:24.580" style="s2">is to eat you enough so that you never leave<br />- the probability is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.580" end="01:20:30.310" style="s2">And that&#39;s no joke. You know, one of the things<br />that you do learn if you read about the sorts</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.310" end="01:20:34.330" style="s2">of people who burst out of their mother&#39;s<br />basement and go shoot up Dawson College is</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.330" end="01:20:39.190" style="s2">often that&#39;s exactly the situation they&#39;ve<br />been in. They&#39;re burning with resentment in</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.190" end="01:20:43.490" style="s2">their uselessness down in the basement for<br />five or six year. They don&#39;t have to leave.</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.490" end="01:20:48.290" style="s2">They don&#39;t have to become independent. Everything&#39;s<br />done for them, so they never have to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.290" end="01:20:55.390" style="s2">for themselves. It&#39;s not pretty, and so one<br />of the rules for dealing with people - and</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.390" end="01:21:03.290" style="s2">I know this is actually a rule for dealing<br />with elderly people in hopes for retired people</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.290" end="01:21:06.620" style="s2">- is that do not do anything for anyone they<br />cannot do for themselves. You&#39;re stealing</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.620" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">from them when you do that. And it&#39;s a great<br />rule of thumb for kids. Once they can dress</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:16.170" style="s2">themselves, they dress themselves. If they<br />can set the table, even if it takes twenty</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.170" end="01:21:21.030" style="s2">minutes, it&#39;s like, they&#39;re setting the table.<br />You&#39;re not doing a favor by helping them do</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.030" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">anything they can do themselves. It&#39;s kind<br />of harsh, but it beats the hell out of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:27.890" style="s2">witch in Hansel and Gretel</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.890" end="01:21:33.120" style="s2">So anyways, one of the things we&#39;re going<br />to look at as well, is the dark side of positive</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.120" end="01:21:42.760" style="s2">motivations. Now how are we gonna do this?<br />One of the things you might ask yourself is</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.760" end="01:21:47.980" style="s2">how in the world do you know if something<br />is true? Now, the first thing I would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.980" end="01:21:52.940" style="s2">is that the attitude you guys should bring<br />to this class is that nothing that I tell</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.940" end="01:22:00.170" style="s2">you is true. Okay, now I don&#39;t mean you should<br />be arrogantly skeptical because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.170" end="01:22:08.780" style="s2">appropriate. But, you should bring every critical<br />faculty you have to bear on what I tell you</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.780" end="01:22:13.210" style="s2">to see if you can chip away at it because<br />what you want to do is you want to build yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.210" end="01:22:19.010" style="s2">a body of knowledge that you cannot undermine.<br />And the way you do that is by trying to undermine</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.010" end="01:22:23.230" style="s2">it, by hacking away at the foundation with<br />everything you&#39;ve got, and if the ideas can</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.230" end="01:22:29.200" style="s2">withstand a total onslaught, then you&#39;ve got<br />something. You&#39;ve got a foundation. You&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.200" end="01:22:34.140" style="s2">got something you can stand on that&#39;s gonna<br />be there when things get rough.</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.140" end="01:22:38.980" style="s2">So I&#39;m gonna tell you what I found that&#39;s<br />been useful to me when things got rough, but</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.980" end="01:22:44.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t expect you to assume that that&#39;s gonna<br />work for you, and I don&#39;t want you to - like</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:49.920" style="s2">I want you to listen and to think, but I want<br />you to keep your wits about you. Now, I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.920" end="01:22:55.320" style="s2">gonna tell you how I go about to determine<br />whether something is true. Now first of all,</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.320" end="01:23:04.700" style="s2">there&#39;s different definitions of truth. So<br />we&#39;re gonna flip back and forth between two.</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.700" end="01:23:09.140" style="s2">One definition of truth is an objective definition,<br />but we don&#39;t have to talk much about that</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.140" end="01:23:13.580" style="s2">cause you guys already know what that is;<br />but there&#39;s another definition of truth that</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.580" end="01:23:19.210" style="s2">I think the best way of defining it is as<br />pragmatically true. Pragmatism is a branch</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.210" end="01:23:23.580" style="s2">of American philosophy, and it&#39;s a very sophisticated<br />branch of philosophy. In fact, I actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.580" end="01:23:27.350" style="s2">think it&#39;s the most sophisticated brand of<br />philosophy.</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.350" end="01:23:33.160" style="s2">Probably because it makes the least claims.<br />What the pragmatists state, basically, is</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.160" end="01:23:37.680" style="s2">well you really don&#39;t know anything. You don&#39;t<br />have ultimate knowledge about anything, so</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.680" end="01:23:42.020" style="s2">your knowledge always bottoms out in ignorance.<br />So then the question is well, how do you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.020" end="01:23:47.660" style="s2">then, if anything is true? And the pragmatists<br />would say, in a sense you don&#39;t. What you</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.660" end="01:23:53.850" style="s2">know always is if something is true enough<br />for a particular function. So for example,</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.850" end="01:23:58.160" style="s2">your theory about getting to the door might<br />be that you can stand up and walk there, and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.160" end="01:24:02.240" style="s2">you might - well god only knows what might<br />happen on the way there you know. Maybe there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.240" end="01:24:05.690" style="s2">be an earthquake, or a ceiling tile might<br />fall on you. Who knows? Maybe you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.690" end="01:24:10.680" style="s2">a heart attack. So you don&#39;t know whether<br />you can get there; you can infer from past</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.680" end="01:24:16.890" style="s2">experience, but if you get there then what<br />you can say is my statement about truth was</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.890" end="01:24:22.770" style="s2">sufficient so that the outcome was what the<br />theory predicted. So in some sense, what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.770" end="01:24:26.990" style="s2">pragmatists are saying is that every time<br />you make a statement, especially if it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.990" end="01:24:32.750" style="s2">to action, that you offer a theory of truth<br />along with that statement, implicitly which</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.750" end="01:24:38.520" style="s2">is that this is true enough if what I predict<br />happens happens.</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.520" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">And so, it&#39;s a very nice theory eh? It doesn&#39;t<br />require you to be omniscient about anything</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:48.390" style="s2">for things to be true enough, and you are<br />ignorant - you don&#39;t know everything about</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.390" end="01:24:53.940" style="s2">anything, and so obviously you&#39;re working<br />in the world with partial knowledge, and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.940" end="01:25:01.120" style="s2">works - not all the time. You get old, you<br />get sick, you die. You&#39;re not gonna work it</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.120" end="01:25:08.770" style="s2">out thoroughly. So we&#39;re gonna use the pragmatic<br />truth framework and we&#39;re gonna use the objective</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.770" end="01:25:14.460" style="s2">truth framework. And one of the propositions<br />that I&#39;m going to make to you is that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.460" end="01:25:24.520" style="s2">stories that are associated with our deepest<br />moral intuitions are pragmatic truths, and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.520" end="01:25:28.780" style="s2">that you need pragmatic truths and you need<br />objective truths, and you need pragmatic truths</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.780" end="01:25:35.510" style="s2">because you don&#39;t just need to know what the<br />world&#39;s made of. You need to know what to</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.510" end="01:25:40.580" style="s2">do about the fact that the world&#39;s made out<br />of things. And because human beings are motoric</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.580" end="01:25:46.600" style="s2">creatures, we act in the world. We act on<br />the world, so what we need to know is how</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.600" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">is it that you should act on the world. That<br />is not a question that could be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:55.540" style="s2">by objective methods. Technically right? Because<br />it&#39;s actually a value question. What should</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.540" end="01:26:02.580" style="s2">you do? Science, by its very methodologies,<br />refuses to answer such questions.</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.580" end="01:26:08.390" style="s2">People confuse the fact that science is value<br />free, sort of, with the idea that existence</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.390" end="01:26:14.420" style="s2">is value free. Like that&#39;s philosophically<br />primitive, I would say, because science was</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.420" end="01:26:20.030" style="s2">actually set up to get rid of the value of<br />this objective value in its technique. So</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.030" end="01:26:25.580" style="s2">you can&#39;t say we set this thing up to get<br />the values and all the values fall. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.580" end="01:26:33.810" style="s2">there&#39;s no value. No, no, you put that domain<br />out of the range of consideration. That doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.810" end="01:26:42.080" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s just a different<br />- it requires a different philosophy, a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.080" end="01:26:47.670" style="s2">outlook, different techniques, different tools,<br />different methods of proof. All of these things.</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.670" end="01:26:52.450" style="s2">So part of what we&#39;re gonna do - I&#39;m gonna<br />use objective truth as much as I possibly</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.450" end="01:26:58.980" style="s2">can because I think that a lot of what psychology,<br />as a science, has been able to offer in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.980" end="01:27:04.100" style="s2">last hundred years has been extraordinarily<br />useful for elucidating some of the issues</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.100" end="01:27:08.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to discuss. Because we really<br />have made some progress in understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.310" end="01:27:15.170" style="s2">psyche, especially at a biological/behavioral<br />level. We got some pretty solid information,</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.170" end="01:27:19.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s helpful.</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.150" end="01:27:23.420" style="s2">So we&#39;re gonna draw on a bunch of sources.<br />We&#39;re gonna draw on stories. We&#39;re gonna draw</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.420" end="01:27:26.710" style="s2">on literature. We&#39;re gonna draw on philosophy.<br />We&#39;re gonna draw on religion. We&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.710" end="01:27:33.050" style="s2">draw on mythology. We&#39;re gonna draw on biology<br />and psychology. There&#39;s this idea which you</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.050" end="01:27:35.780" style="s2">should&#39;ve learned about - which you should&#39;ve<br />learned about if you&#39;re a psychologist - called</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.780" end="01:27:42.960" style="s2">multi method multi trait matrix. This was<br />invented back in the 1950&#39;s. I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.960" end="01:27:46.990" style="s2">Meehl and Cronbach. It was a famous paper<br />that was published in the 50&#39;s. Everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.990" end="01:27:52.950" style="s2">supposed to know it. No one ever pays attention<br />to it. But, what they were interested in is</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.950" end="01:28:02.380" style="s2">how do you know if when you say that something<br />exists, like let&#39;s say anger, does anger exist?</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.380" end="01:28:13.680" style="s2">Well, the answer seems self evident. It&#39;s<br />tricky because generally no one comes up to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.680" end="01:28:16.630" style="s2">you and says anger. They tell you a little<br />story where they use words related to anger</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.630" end="01:28:21.820" style="s2">in the story and you sort of derive what they<br />mean by angry from the context.</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.820" end="01:28:30.490" style="s2">The context is important in defining the reality,<br />so you don&#39;t know if the central idea, anger,</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.490" end="01:28:35.970" style="s2">can be pulled out of the context and you can<br />say that&#39;s a thing like iron is a thing, or</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.970" end="01:28:41.000" style="s2">like mercury is a thing. Maybe it&#39;s not. Maybe<br />it&#39;s a pattern or maybe it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.000" end="01:28:45.210" style="s2">is a convention or you know, maybe there&#39;s<br />all sorts of things that are associated with</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.210" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">it. So, one of Cronbach and Meehl&#39;s fundamental<br />claims was that in order to determine whether</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:28:59.320" style="s2">or not something existed, you had to be able<br />to detect it using different methods. Now,</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.320" end="01:29:05.420" style="s2">it&#39;s tricky because it&#39;s not obvious what<br />constitutes a different method. So you kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.420" end="01:29:09.940" style="s2">of have to make a judgment but I would say<br />you use a multi method, multi trait means</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.940" end="01:29:17.220" style="s2">of determining what&#39;s true with your senses.<br />How many do you have? Six, because you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.220" end="01:29:25.610" style="s2">proprioception. Why? Well let&#39;s say five,<br />for the sake of simplicity. Why? Why not one?</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.610" end="01:29:31.240" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[Student answers: To increase the likelihood<br />of it being true. You could see something</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.240" end="01:29:41.670" style="s2">but not touch it. That might be a mirage maybe.<br />So there&#39;s multiple reasons for it to be pointing</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.670" end="01:29:43.630" style="s2">to the probability of it being true.]</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.630" end="01:29:48.740" style="s2">&gt;&gt;Yes, well that&#39;s exactly it. And you want<br />it to be - so the sense idea is a really good</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.740" end="01:29:53.240" style="s2">one because you can see sense uses different<br />modalities. It&#39;s like obviously the eyes rely</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.240" end="01:29:58.920" style="s2">on electromagnetic radiation and the ears<br />rely on vibrations in the ear, and touch is</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.920" end="01:30:04.240" style="s2">really an atomic phenomena in some sense because<br />you&#39;re feeling the outer surfaces of electrons</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.240" end="01:30:09.817" style="s2">with your electron surfaces. There&#39;s taste,<br />which is again a molecular level phenomena. And smell.</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.040" end="01:30:16.780" style="s2">So our idea kind of is, is if all five of<br />those things detect it, it&#39;s sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.780" end="01:30:21.909" style="s2">real so we can use it to guide our actions<br />and we won&#39;t be wrong. So it&#39;s five dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.909" end="01:30:26.430" style="s2">- you need a five-dimensional analysis, and<br />that&#39;s evolved. You might say, well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.430" end="01:30:31.090" style="s2">call that a good estimate. You need five ways<br />of detecting something before you can be sure</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.090" end="01:30:39.090" style="s2">it&#39;s true. Now you know, when you&#39;re learning<br />about experimental psychology, p is less than</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.090" end="01:30:44.600" style="s2">0.05 and you use a measurement, and then you<br />determine whether the probability that that</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.600" end="01:30:51.100" style="s2">has manifested itself exceeds a certain level<br />of chance. If it does, then the thing exists.</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.100" end="01:30:57.660" style="s2">But that&#39;s actually not right. It&#39;s not right<br />for experimental psychology, and experimental</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.660" end="01:31:02.030" style="s2">psychologists have known it since the late<br />fifties. You have to demonstrate the damn</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.030" end="01:31:07.890" style="s2">thing exists multiple different ways. Now,<br />what constitutes a different way can be subject</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.890" end="01:31:13.390" style="s2">to debate. It&#39;s a complicated thing to sort<br />out, but you can kinda figure it out right?</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.390" end="01:31:17.630" style="s2">Maybe use a physiological measurement and<br />self report or something like that, or you</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.630" end="01:31:23.590" style="s2">self report another report. Maybe you don&#39;t<br />need five, but you probably need three, or</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.590" end="01:31:28.750" style="s2">something like that depending on the - so<br />what I&#39;m going to do is tell you a story,</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.750" end="01:31:34.630" style="s2">roughly speaking, and I wanna make the story<br />evident at five or six different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.630" end="01:31:40.710" style="s2">analysis. And I want to show you how the story<br />is the same at all these levels of analysis.</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.710" end="01:31:50.570" style="s2">Now, the one - one of the potential flaws<br />of that method is this. Joseph Campbell, for</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.570" end="01:31:55.890" style="s2">example, wrote about hero mythology. Some<br />of you have probably read The Hero of a Thousand</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.890" end="01:32:00.260" style="s2">Faces. One of the criticisms about Joseph<br />Campbell and people like him, is that they</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.260" end="01:32:06.920" style="s2">read the stories of multiple cultures, but<br />they have an a priori framework. Because of</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.920" end="01:32:12.050" style="s2">the a priori framework, they only see what<br />their theory tells them that they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.050" end="01:32:12.530" style="s2">to see.</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.530" end="01:32:17.850" style="s2">They don&#39;t look for the exceptions, so it&#39;s<br />a problem with pattern recognition. You may</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.850" end="01:32:24.880" style="s2">be able to recognize patterns where they don&#39;t<br />exist. Now, my method could be criticized</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.880" end="01:32:31.080" style="s2">on that grounds. But, the way I&#39;ve tried to<br />protect myself against that was to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.080" end="01:32:37.600" style="s2">I drew from enough sources so that the probability<br />I would be able to tell a coherent story across</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.600" end="01:32:42.960" style="s2">all those different types of methods is vanishingly<br />small. Now you&#39;re going to have to decide</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.960" end="01:32:52.520" style="s2">if that&#39;s true. I&#39;ll tell you roughly, the<br />dimensions of analysis. The ideas that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.520" end="01:32:56.960" style="s2">going to talk to you about, I&#39;ve put into<br />practice personally. They work for me. They</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.960" end="01:33:00.400" style="s2">work for the people that I&#39;ve taught them<br />to, so those are family members often, but</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.400" end="01:33:04.530" style="s2">not only family members, lots of other people<br />because I&#39;m also a clinician right? So it</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.530" end="01:33:09.110" style="s2">seems to work quite nicely. I have a lot of<br />people write to to me and tell me the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.110" end="01:33:20.010" style="s2">have worked. So, I&#39;ve got multi rater reliability.<br />And then, I think it&#39;s manifest biologically,</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.010" end="01:33:24.760" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s manifest culturally, and<br />I think it&#39;s manifested in these very, very</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.760" end="01:33:34.080" style="s2">old stories and anthropologically and so forth.<br />You know, make up your own mind, you can see.</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.080" end="01:33:38.000" style="s2">The other thing - I don&#39;t really know what<br />to do, what to make of this. You know sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.000" end="01:33:43.240" style="s2">you have an intuition of truth. It&#39;s like<br />maybe you&#39;re describing a problem to someone</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.240" end="01:33:47.590" style="s2">and they say this seems to be at the heart<br />of it. They give you a formulation, and it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.590" end="01:33:53.280" style="s2">kind of goes click. Yeah, that&#39;s how all those<br />things hang together. It&#39;s a pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.280" end="01:33:59.930" style="s2">mechanism. People generally have the feeling<br />that when something like that happens, something</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.930" end="01:34:07.420" style="s2">of truth has been revealed. Now, a very common<br />response from the students I had in these</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.420" end="01:34:14.800" style="s2">courses is that I never tell anyone anything<br />they don&#39;t already know. And the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.800" end="01:34:19.030" style="s2">that, what I&#39;m hoping is the reason, is that<br />what I&#39;m outlining is archetypal structures</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.030" end="01:34:22.530" style="s2">and you know, I&#39;ve drawn a lot of my work<br />from Jung and was very interested in archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.530" end="01:34:26.900" style="s2">structures. So, what will happen - and I think<br />it will happen - is I&#39;ll tell you a story,</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.900" end="01:34:30.860" style="s2">you&#39;ll think oh yeah right, that&#39;s what that<br />means, and I see in here all the things that</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.860" end="01:34:35.800" style="s2">it explains. So you&#39;ll have this sense, and<br />that&#39;s the - we talked about your friend with</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.800" end="01:34:42.480" style="s2">the spiritual awakening. Often, one of the<br />cognitive phenomena that accompanies a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.480" end="01:34:49.280" style="s2">awakening is the connections of many, many<br />diverse phenomena into an overarching unity.</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.280" end="01:34:53.790" style="s2">And you feel that, like as a radical simplification.<br />It&#39;s something like that, a decrease in entropy,</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.790" end="01:34:59.190" style="s2">or something like that. It&#39;s a very, very<br />powerful sensation. I mean, there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.190" end="01:35:04.880" style="s2">sources of what you might call spiritual experiences<br />as well, but that&#39;s certainly one of them.</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.880" end="01:35:10.780" style="s2">And so you can see you know, I&#39;ll tell you<br />these stories; you can think oh well - how</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.780" end="01:35:18.070" style="s2">does that story manifest itself in your experience?<br />That&#39;s a phenomenological level of truth.</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.070" end="01:35:25.310" style="s2">So the phenomenologists - branch of philosophy<br />- started by Heidegger, not exactly but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.310" end="01:35:33.060" style="s2">say extended as well as anyone extended it,<br />by Heidegger. Heidegger thought that Western</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.060" end="01:35:38.630" style="s2">philosophy had gone wrong basically since the<br />time of Socrates which is quite a long time.</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.630" end="01:35:44.100" style="s2">And he said that we became interested in what<br />the world was made of, and how we knew things,</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.100" end="01:35:50.190" style="s2">and what we should&#39;ve been interested instead<br />was the nature and quality of being. What</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.190" end="01:35:57.340" style="s2">he meant by being isn&#39;t the objective world.<br />What he meant by being was the manner in which</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.340" end="01:36:04.260" style="s2">you have experience. So there are elements<br />of being that aren&#39;t objective elements.</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.260" end="01:36:10.800" style="s2">So I would say pain is a phenomenological<br />reality. It&#39;s not something you can - you</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.800" end="01:36:18.320" style="s2">can index it objectively, but the index is<br />not the phenomena. And you know, is your pain</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.320" end="01:36:25.070" style="s2">real? This is a question for people who think<br />there&#39;s no such thing as meaning. Like you</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.070" end="01:36:29.130" style="s2">try to argue yourself out of pain and see<br />how far you get. You might think, well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.130" end="01:36:32.790" style="s2">not the sort of meaning I meant. Well you<br />know, a negative meaning is a place to start</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.790" end="01:36:37.100" style="s2">right? Because if something&#39;s negative and<br />it&#39;s real, it does imply that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.100" end="01:36:41.760" style="s2">positive that&#39;s real. It might be harder to<br />get a hold of it, but at least it&#39;s not pain.</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.760" end="01:36:51.770" style="s2">But, pain - Descartes, and I&#39;ll close with<br />this. You guys can have a break. Descartes</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.770" end="01:36:56.060" style="s2">implemented a method called radical doubt<br />when he went on his philosophical journey.</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.060" end="01:36:59.330" style="s2">What Descartes looked for was one thing he<br />couldn&#39;t doubt.</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.330" end="01:37:01.890" style="s2">Cause he was probably clinically depressed</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.890" end="01:37:07.090" style="s2">and he was doubting everything, like how do<br />I know the world isn&#39;t just a mirage made</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.090" end="01:37:14.680" style="s2">by an evil demon to obfuscate reality from<br />me. Well his conclusion was that the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.680" end="01:37:21.430" style="s2">that he could not dispute was that he was<br />and could think. Now I don&#39;t think Descartes</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.430" end="01:37:28.880" style="s2">really meant what we meant by think. I think<br />he meant more by what we would mean by experience</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.880" end="01:37:35.830" style="s2">because thought has become a much more narrowly<br />defined term since the time of Descartes.</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.830" end="01:37:40.200" style="s2">So I don&#39;t think he meant I think therefore<br />I am, I think he meant something like I experience.</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.200" end="01:37:45.840" style="s2">I have experience, therefore I am. Regardless<br />of that, modern people think about it as thought.</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.840" end="01:37:51.320" style="s2">Heidegger was different. Heidegger basically<br />said, the one thing you can&#39;t dispute is that</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.320" end="01:38:00.400" style="s2">experience is your experience. It exists.<br />It&#39;s almost by definition, it&#39;s like the definition</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.400" end="01:38:01.740" style="s2">of exist.</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.740" end="01:38:07.660" style="s2">And then he was interested in what the fundamental<br />elements of existence were. And they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.660" end="01:38:12.360" style="s2">atoms, like the fundamental elements of the<br />objective world. They&#39;re more things like</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.360" end="01:38:18.530" style="s2">pain, and for me that was the thing that stopped<br />me from doubting. It&#39;s like, I cannot doubt</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.530" end="01:38:25.520" style="s2">the existence of pain. It seems real. I might<br />say it seems more real than anything else.</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.520" end="01:38:29.530" style="s2">Now, you might say you don&#39;t believe that,<br />but I would say I don&#39;t care what you think</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.530" end="01:38:34.740" style="s2">you believe. I&#39;ll watch you when you&#39;re in<br />pain, and every single one of your actions</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.740" end="01:38:39.340" style="s2">will indicate that you believe in it. And<br />not only that, but that you can&#39;t not believe</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.340" end="01:38:45.960" style="s2">in it. It&#39;s there, and it&#39;s there so much<br />that that&#39;s a meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.960" end="01:38:52.440" style="s2">And so it&#39;s in that way that Heidegger thought<br />out existence, or as experience as composed</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.440" end="01:38:56.880" style="s2">of meaning. So part of the reason this course<br />is called Maps of Meaning is that because</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.880" end="01:39:01.330" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;re going to look at is<br />the structure of meaning, and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.330" end="01:39:06.230" style="s2">to start with negative meaning because from<br />my perspective - look you can doubt whether</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.230" end="01:39:11.760" style="s2">or not good exists. But once I&#39;m done telling<br />you the things that I know about human history,</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.760" end="01:39:16.110" style="s2">there won&#39;t be a single person in this room<br />who thinks that evil doesn&#39;t exist. And you</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.110" end="01:39:20.900" style="s2">might think that&#39;s a bloody horrible thing<br />to learn, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.900" end="01:39:28.040" style="s2">useful because once you can establish something<br />that you cannot deny, you can move from that.</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.040" end="01:39:36.090" style="s2">I think you can hypothesize that if you&#39;re<br />capable of detecting radical evil, I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.090" end="01:39:42.210" style="s2">you about Unit 731, or you can look it up<br />yourself - I wouldn&#39;t recommend it by the</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.210" end="01:39:43.520" style="s2">way.</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.520" end="01:39:48.360" style="s2">Once you can identify radical evil and you<br />think, well that&#39;s just - beyond a doubt that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.360" end="01:39:54.050" style="s2">reprehensible. There&#39;s no justification for<br />that whatsoever, no matter what, whenever.</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.050" end="01:39:57.340" style="s2">Well then you&#39;ve got something to stand on,<br />and you can start thinking, well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.340" end="01:40:02.550" style="s2">absolute opposite of that thing? It might<br />be, how is it that you can conduct yourself</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.550" end="01:40:08.590" style="s2">so that in your sphere of influence, the probability<br />that anything like that is reduced to the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.590" end="01:40:15.210" style="s2">absolute maximum? Well, that&#39;s a reasonably<br />moral question. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.210" end="01:40:21.210" style="s2">you can dispense with with a casual nihilism.<br />I don&#39;t think a nihilist can dispense with</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.210" end="01:40:29.780" style="s2">it, because even nihilists suffer. Thank god<br />for that. It&#39;s their only source of potential</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.780" end="01:40:34.190" style="s2">salvation. Sometimes they notice it - oh I&#39;m<br />suffering from all this nihilism, maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.190" end="01:40:39.010" style="s2">indicates there&#39;s something flawed in it.<br />It&#39;s always possible.</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.200" end="01:40:44.395" style="s2">Okay, so let&#39;s take a break. We will come back at, what time is it?</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.560" end="01:40:46.256" style="s2">2:58</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.377" end="01:40:53.688" style="s2">2:58? Okay. Come back at 3:15. We will see you then. And then I will talk to you more about the technical elements of the class.</p>
