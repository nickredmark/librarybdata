<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">I would worryingly think that may be</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">correct yes and I must say I know why it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:36.660" style="s2">is that you&#39;re hated and as much as they</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">very stupid well I haven&#39;t been the kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">of stupid that you are I know what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">mean it&#39;s definitely not a great</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">strategy for life but it is an important</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.979" style="s2">strategy it&#39;s necessary that some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">do what you&#39;re doing and very few have</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">the the characteristics to allow it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">I think the I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">one in their right mind would actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:18.590" style="s2">put themselves into the position that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">I&#39;m in right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.590" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">so do you want to say a bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">that position is so I&#39;m in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">interesting situation where I why so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">initially I realized the issue when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">was at university studying orthodontics</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">so clearly I you can do dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">without an orthodontic qualification but</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">I thought for me to do what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">do it was vital for me to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">puck or orthodontic qualification so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">went to our hoose University in Denmark</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">one of the top ones and what I observed</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">when I was chatting to the staff and my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">colleagues and peers who were studying</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:03.810" style="s2">is that the big gap was the etiology the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">why and it&#39;s always been my question I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.810" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">was a kid the one of the kids always</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">used to ask why and you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">cause of things and then often I asked</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">the why</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">to the response as I get and another</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:20.489" style="s2">wire in another way and I worked out</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">this was the weak link if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.489" end="00:02:25.470" style="s2">the cause of the bottom you know should</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">we really be getting involved in any</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.470" end="00:02:29.060" style="s2">sort of treatment because in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:33.709" style="s2">treatments supposed to be about</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.060" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">affecting the causes of a problem so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.709" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">then had a letter-writing campaign in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">the UK where I started with an editorial</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">called the Black Swan so you can look up</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">British dental journal and Black Swan</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:51.239" style="s2">and like me that was the article that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:54.180" style="s2">started with the editor very kindly gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.239" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">me the of the editorial and I wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.180" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">now I then had about sort of best part</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">of five years of hard letter writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:02.549" style="s2">about say why he&#39;s crooked what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">on you know we&#39;re treating all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.549" end="00:03:11.069" style="s2">people I mean really go anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">then I started by almost by chance so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.069" end="00:03:16.519" style="s2">became an internet success I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:20.609" style="s2">really expecting it but I had several um</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.519" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">YouTube videos up people started sending</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.609" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">me emails and I was just so he was quick</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:28.310" style="s2">rather than responding to emails to put</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">another video up another explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.310" end="00:03:35.670" style="s2">this court of thing called mewing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:38.390" style="s2">started now it was it kind of surprised</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">me that people would go to what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.390" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">extremists eclis an incredible effort</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">you know to change your habits and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">craniofacial structure by exchanging</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">habits Matt it&#39;s hard work however why</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">not the benefits that you can achieve by</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">doing this are incredible you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">basically it&#39;s like saying get fit you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">know it&#39;s a tough thing to do mmm it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">tough thing to maintain but why not well</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s orient people a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.370" end="00:04:17.250" style="s2">has been saying for years where the hell</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.280" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">is evolutionary dentistry I know where</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.250" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">evolutionary medicine is and it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">almost nowhere but at least there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">formal recognition that there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">something wrong with teaching medicine</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:29.610" style="s2">outside of an evolutionary context</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:32.819" style="s2">molnar people get that message when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:35.130" style="s2">comes to dentistry I have to almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.819" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">literally bite my tongue when I go to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.130" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">dentist or an orthodontist because what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:42.030" style="s2">they say about what&#39;s taking place just</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:44.610" style="s2">simply doesn&#39;t add up it would take</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.030" end="00:04:46.259" style="s2">about ten minutes to explain why the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:49.889" style="s2">stories that we apparently tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.259" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">ourselves about teeth are not plausible</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.889" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:57.270" style="s2">therefore this raises a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:05:00.060" style="s2">question for all of those of us who have</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.270" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">been exposed to dentistry and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.060" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">orthodontics how much have we harmed</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">ourselves by accepting these narratives</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:10.410" style="s2">and then following through two</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:14.690" style="s2">treatments that then have downstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.410" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">consequences it&#39;s just mind-boggling</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.690" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">aye-aye-aye aye-aye-aye will almost hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:22.770" style="s2">back on saying what I think is the full</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:26.520" style="s2">extent of the harm that we&#39;ve caused</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.770" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">ourselves either by inaction or by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">actions that medicine has been taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:33.259" style="s2">though those two things and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">it has affected an entire generation</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.259" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">although well I can say just so my my</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:48.419" style="s2">viewers know why this is personal to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:51.419" style="s2">now this year I had three teeth removed</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.419" end="00:05:55.259" style="s2">I had two more that are scheduled and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.419" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">was postponed by kovat 19 and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.259" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">for this is something called root</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">resorption now I had never heard of root</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:04.979" style="s2">reserves until I had a tooth shatter on</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">me and then I had x-rays taken and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.979" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">turned out that I have this condition</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">well it happens that this condition</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:14.180" style="s2">lines up with aggressive orthodontics</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">which I definitely had as a young person</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.180" end="00:06:20.820" style="s2">so almost you know Bret I&#39;ll take that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">back when you put fixed braces you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.820" end="00:06:25.979" style="s2">with orthodontist appliances it will</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:29.639" style="s2">cause root resorption on almost every</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.979" end="00:06:32.699" style="s2">single tooth and that&#39;s just without</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.639" end="00:06:35.909" style="s2">aggressive mechanics right so apparently</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.699" end="00:06:39.029" style="s2">I had no choice in the matter as a child</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.909" end="00:06:41.129" style="s2">it was simply my parents doing what they</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.029" end="00:06:44.069" style="s2">had been told was necessary for my</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.129" end="00:06:47.369" style="s2">well being that cost a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.069" end="00:06:51.059" style="s2">and then downstream I&#39;m now suffering</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.369" end="00:06:52.649" style="s2">massive consequences right just terrible</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.059" end="00:06:55.729" style="s2">stuff where I&#39;m going to have implants</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.649" end="00:06:58.769" style="s2">put in which is a an awful process and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.729" end="00:07:01.319" style="s2">you know that does to say nothing of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.769" end="00:07:01.769" style="s2">financial costs which are through the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.319" end="00:07:04.229" style="s2">roof</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.769" end="00:07:06.029" style="s2">certainly far exceeding what my parents</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.229" end="00:07:08.849" style="s2">invested in braces in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.029" end="00:07:10.889" style="s2">and all of this is because orthodontics</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.849" end="00:07:13.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a correct story about why</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.889" end="00:07:15.119" style="s2">the teeth are crooked in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.589" end="00:07:17.279" style="s2">and therefore doesn&#39;t take the right</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.119" end="00:07:19.229" style="s2">approach to treatment I mean it thinks</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.279" end="00:07:21.449" style="s2">that I have some sort of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.229" end="00:07:24.149" style="s2">predisposition to crooked teeth no no</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.449" end="00:07:26.519" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make sense so when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.149" end="00:07:28.499" style="s2">one of your videos explaining that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.519" end="00:07:30.119" style="s2">had also deduced that the story makes no</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.499" end="00:07:32.669" style="s2">sense and going through all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.119" end="00:07:35.669" style="s2">evidence I was just I was gobsmacked to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.669" end="00:07:37.769" style="s2">use the the British term yeah so do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.669" end="00:07:39.899" style="s2">want to tell us a little bit about why</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.769" end="00:07:41.579" style="s2">the evolutionary explanation that some</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.899" end="00:07:47.579" style="s2">of us just have a genetic predisposition</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.579" end="00:07:49.139" style="s2">to crooked teeth is wrong well I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.579" end="00:07:51.029" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tell you if our ancestors had</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.139" end="00:07:54.929" style="s2">um cardiovascular problems where they</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.029" end="00:07:58.559" style="s2">had diabetes or sleep apnea we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.929" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">know I we think less however I know</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.559" end="00:08:04.499" style="s2">where that Heath were or still are you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:08.129" style="s2">can go into museums today you can look</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.499" end="00:08:11.569" style="s2">at ancestral material you know only a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.129" end="00:08:17.429" style="s2">thousand years ago from all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:21.329" style="s2">Scandinavian remains recovered everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.429" end="00:08:23.519" style="s2">that had wisdom teeth had them working</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.329" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">in in function and that was most people</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.519" end="00:08:29.969" style="s2">now today having a wisdom teeth in is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">rarity we almost think that is an extra</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.969" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">tooth I mean yeah the idea it&#39;s an extra</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">tooth or we evolved out of this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:39.000" style="s2">where does this fit with Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">evolution he doesn&#39;t you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.000" end="00:08:42.419" style="s2">survival of the fittest is death of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:44.699" style="s2">weakest unless you go round killing</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.419" end="00:08:46.980" style="s2">people whose wisdom teeth come in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.699" end="00:08:50.130" style="s2">ain&#39;t gonna change and you&#39;d need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.980" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">kill a lot of people you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.130" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">no idea how many times I&#39;ve sat in a</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">to raise the point that the idea we have</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:04.710" style="s2">removal is preposterous and I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.340" end="00:09:07.170" style="s2">seem to make the point all my fingers</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.710" end="00:09:11.570" style="s2">seem to fit on my hand just fine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.170" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">that&#39;s so odd I was just lucky I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.570" end="00:09:17.190" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s but people like simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:18.300" style="s2">explanations and of course as I say for</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:46.770" style="s2">top of that if there were to be</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">I mean we&#39;ve got lots of people running</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.740" style="s2">even know what the liability would be so</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.820" end="00:10:07.380" style="s2">once you&#39;re down this road with a</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.380" end="00:10:12.450" style="s2">what causes crooked teeth then it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.070" end="00:10:29.310" style="s2">yeah very value medicines very good at</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.610" end="00:10:43.560" style="s2">medicine is very bad at making a 180</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.380" end="00:10:45.510" style="s2">degree turn and it seems you know with</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.560" end="00:10:47.790" style="s2">the hit the history is littered with his</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.510" end="00:10:49.530" style="s2">events where it was screaming that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.790" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">needed to make a 180 degree turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.530" end="00:10:54.630" style="s2">but people have got to admit they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">wrong and there&#39;s implications to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.630" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s not likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">without difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.720" end="00:11:15.579" style="s2">so how much can you tell me about about</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.600" end="00:11:17.079" style="s2">root resorption well I mean I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.579" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">you that it seems to happen on almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.079" end="00:11:24.190" style="s2">every tooth that are fixed to plus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">bonded to a wire what seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.190" end="00:11:33.190" style="s2">problem is that the brace is dictating</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:36.130" style="s2">where a tooth goes artificially and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.190" end="00:11:39.699" style="s2">mouth wants a tooth to go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.130" end="00:11:42.760" style="s2">through physiology this is different</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.699" end="00:11:44.440" style="s2">feedback to some some types of mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.760" end="00:11:47.110" style="s2">that is trying to determine where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.440" end="00:11:50.649" style="s2">tooth should be and of course most vases</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.110" end="00:11:52.180" style="s2">seem this is my ballparking it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.649" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">be there&#39;s a bit of flexibility between</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:56.769" style="s2">the brace and allowing it to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:59.800" style="s2">between two positions and of course also</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.769" end="00:12:01.930" style="s2">when you put braces on you the way your</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:05.350" style="s2">teeth bite together seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.930" end="00:12:08.199" style="s2">disrupted and you&#39;re now biting in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.350" end="00:12:10.569" style="s2">strange different ways that&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.199" end="00:12:13.990" style="s2">strange different movements of the teeth</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.569" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">and you know when I want to get a steak</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.990" end="00:12:20.670" style="s2">out of the ground I rock it backwards</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:23.079" style="s2">and forwards mm-hmm then it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.670" end="00:12:25.449" style="s2">you know and if you&#39;ve got these strange</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.079" end="00:12:29.319" style="s2">motions on teeth you know the bolted in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.449" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">places you know I think we&#39;re we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.319" end="00:12:34.510" style="s2">the potential for running risks here so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:36.490" style="s2">let me let me deploy the model I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.510" end="00:12:40.180" style="s2">I have happens I have a skull here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.490" end="00:12:42.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s human no one operated</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.180" end="00:12:45.190" style="s2">I promise you know this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.250" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">seal scale but it&#39;ll it&#39;ll do so there</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.190" end="00:12:49.389" style="s2">what I did not know what I think of as</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:51.699" style="s2">the real story of teeth is that our</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.389" end="00:12:53.889" style="s2">teeth are not directly bonded to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.699" end="00:12:56.589" style="s2">bone in our jaws there&#39;s a ligament that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.889" end="00:12:59.730" style="s2">attaches them so we have we have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.589" end="00:13:02.500" style="s2">called a gum photic joint</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">Conforti joins the gold FATA joined is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.500" end="00:13:09.190" style="s2">very tight joint so it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:11.620" style="s2">joints on my fingers that have a great</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.190" end="00:13:13.870" style="s2">range of motion agon 40 joint is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.620" end="00:13:16.330" style="s2">where you have a fibrous connection in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:19.750" style="s2">this case sharpie fibers</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.330" end="00:13:23.380" style="s2">the that um basically that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.750" end="00:13:25.390" style="s2">refer to as the periodontal membrane so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.380" end="00:13:28.660" style="s2">the paralleled membrane anchors the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.390" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">teeth into the bone with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.660" end="00:13:33.400" style="s2">flexibility a little bit of flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:34.870" style="s2">and people who are listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.400" end="00:13:37.390" style="s2">will almost certainly have had the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.870" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">following experience they will hit a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.390" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">tooth not hard enough to dislodge it</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">they will detect that it is loose and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:49.180" style="s2">Wiggles and then it will tighten back up</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:51.550" style="s2">so bases of orthodontics exactly so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.180" end="00:13:53.710" style="s2">point is we have built in a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.550" end="00:13:55.570" style="s2">that actually detects where the tooth</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.710" end="00:13:57.100" style="s2">should be based on you know if a tooth</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.570" end="00:13:58.420" style="s2">is bumping up against another and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.100" end="00:14:00.940" style="s2">there&#39;s pressure it can be moved</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.420" end="00:14:03.460" style="s2">slightly but in general it&#39;s it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.940" end="00:14:07.210" style="s2">right place with feedback from chewing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.460" end="00:14:11.350" style="s2">and other such things and only when it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.210" end="00:14:13.690" style="s2">has been dislodged does it reattach and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.350" end="00:14:16.630" style="s2">so what orthodontics does is it takes</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.690" end="00:14:19.030" style="s2">advantage of this system and it puts</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.630" end="00:14:20.590" style="s2">pressure that&#39;s directional and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.030" end="00:14:22.750" style="s2">happens is the tooth actually moves</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.590" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">through the bone breaking down bone</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.750" end="00:14:27.010" style="s2">ahead of it and building bone behind it</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:29.010" style="s2">this is how your orthodontist gets your</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.010" end="00:14:31.870" style="s2">teeth to move and position and line up</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.010" end="00:14:33.670" style="s2">which and it&#39;s very effective</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.870" end="00:14:37.210" style="s2">if you won&#39;t perfectly straight teeth</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.670" end="00:14:39.460" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.210" end="00:14:42.550" style="s2">also that orthodontics will achieve it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.460" end="00:14:44.110" style="s2">for you well but apparently not stabili</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.550" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">apparently it comes at a cost</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.110" end="00:14:52.780" style="s2">well there is that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:56.050" style="s2">all right so something about taking a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.780" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">tooth and moving it through the jaw I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:15:01.960" style="s2">believe is very likely to turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">expend this capacity basically I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.960" end="00:15:06.910" style="s2">told the question I asked my</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:09.520" style="s2">orthodontist at were my dentist at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.910" end="00:15:11.020" style="s2">point that it became clear that some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.520" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">my teeth needed to be removed and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.020" end="00:15:16.570" style="s2">replaced with implants was well I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">my wisdom teeth can&#39;t we move my teeth</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.570" end="00:15:21.070" style="s2">forward now and fill in the gap and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:23.530" style="s2">was told no it&#39;s too late at the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.070" end="00:15:25.200" style="s2">somebody&#39;s your age the capacity to move</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.530" end="00:15:28.630" style="s2">teeth like you could do in youth is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">largely expended is that fair I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.630" end="00:15:33.640" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s just Dee</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:36.940" style="s2">creasing is an exponential curve that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.640" end="00:15:39.640" style="s2">goes down you could do it but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.940" end="00:15:41.950" style="s2">need to move a tooth decent distances</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.640" end="00:15:44.260" style="s2">you&#39;re going to lose a lot of the route</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.950" end="00:15:45.790" style="s2">so if you&#39;re moving a tooth the distance</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:47.230" style="s2">we talked earlier on about the jiggling</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.790" end="00:15:49.720" style="s2">sort of motion causing root resorption</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.230" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">there&#39;s another way to court root cause</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.720" end="00:15:56.520" style="s2">root resorption the fact is that as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:58.810" style="s2">tooth moves through the bone the bone</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.520" end="00:16:02.140" style="s2">dissolves in front of the teeth and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.810" end="00:16:05.230" style="s2">reforms behind the teeth but to a small</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.140" end="00:16:09.610" style="s2">and lesser degree the root of the tooth</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.230" end="00:16:11.880" style="s2">will also dissolve the bone is much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.610" end="00:16:16.390" style="s2">dynamic the bone has a far greater</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.880" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">capacity to correct rebuild itself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:22.960" style="s2">the tooth has a lesser capacity so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">have a net loss of substance on the root</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.960" end="00:16:29.350" style="s2">of the teeth so this is where your work</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:32.350" style="s2">and my work intersect because there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.350" end="00:16:34.390" style="s2">in these tissues certain to be a counter</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.350" end="00:16:36.550" style="s2">at the ends of the chromosomes called a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.390" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">telomere that sets your lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.550" end="00:16:43.270" style="s2">capacity for cellular replacement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">and if you expend that cellular</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.270" end="00:16:48.070" style="s2">replacement as you move teeth along the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:49.990" style="s2">jaw then it won&#39;t be there for</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.070" end="00:16:51.880" style="s2">maintenance later and so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.990" end="00:16:54.100" style="s2">exactly how that&#39;s gonna play into root</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.880" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">resorption but my guess is my</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:16:59.290" style="s2">orthodontist who was apparently too</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">aggressive with my orthodontia spent my</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.290" end="00:17:04.949" style="s2">lifetime capacity for tooth dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:07.630" style="s2">I am now faced with having inert</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">substitute teeth swapped into the places</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.630" end="00:17:14.110" style="s2">that my teeth were artificially aged</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:16.930" style="s2">an interesting concept I&#39;ve have not</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.110" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">really coronated it from this angle</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.930" end="00:17:21.670" style="s2">before but yeah well I let&#39;s take it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.670" end="00:17:26.620" style="s2">prediction I bet you look at people with</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:29.400" style="s2">tooth resorption that you will find in</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.620" end="00:17:32.650" style="s2">the place where the teeth are resorbing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.400" end="00:17:34.600" style="s2">that their telomeres are also short</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.650" end="00:17:37.570" style="s2">relative to people of the same age group</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.600" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">who did not have orthodontia right</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.570" end="00:17:42.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the prediction that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:44.130" style="s2">prediction well we will I will wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.010" end="00:17:46.410" style="s2">eagerly to see if that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.130" end="00:17:48.630" style="s2">true as is many things in science where</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.410" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">you make a prediction and it can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.630" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">some time sometimes boy I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:57.510" style="s2">that pattern alright so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:00.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t fully filled in this picture</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.510" end="00:18:03.000" style="s2">though your model which I found quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:06.330" style="s2">compelling when I saw you run through it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.000" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">at length involves a change in human</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.330" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">behavior especially around diet that has</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:14.310" style="s2">caused a developmental program that in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:16.710" style="s2">our ancestral environment would have</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.310" end="00:18:18.870" style="s2">made us have very straight wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.710" end="00:18:22.620" style="s2">teeth and it has caused them to come in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">in ways that they do not align properly</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.620" end="00:18:28.260" style="s2">that&#39;s called malocclusion is that right</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:32.070" style="s2">you&#39;re correct okay so can you describe</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.260" end="00:18:35.640" style="s2">what has happened to us what you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.070" end="00:18:37.560" style="s2">the causes are and what it would do to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.640" end="00:18:40.590" style="s2">correct it all right well there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.560" end="00:18:42.450" style="s2">principal things that have changed when</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.590" end="00:18:46.860" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.450" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">whole facial complex the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.860" end="00:18:55.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone from being sort of having an</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:59.490" style="s2">incredibly rough tough hard low-calorie</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.170" end="00:19:03.090" style="s2">diet you know populations were</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.490" end="00:19:05.850" style="s2">controlled by calories you know how much</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.090" end="00:19:08.430" style="s2">food bad and people had to eat anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.850" end="00:19:09.300" style="s2">they got hold off and often those things</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.430" end="00:19:12.390" style="s2">were really tough</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.300" end="00:19:18.210" style="s2">we&#39;ve moved across to this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.390" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">soft very rich calorie rich diet you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.210" end="00:19:23.340" style="s2">know you could have so I&#39;m quickly over</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:26.100" style="s2">so today was my starvation day so just</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.340" end="00:19:28.410" style="s2">before I had this I have to quickly have</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.100" end="00:19:30.810" style="s2">a little bit of drink with a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.410" end="00:19:32.850" style="s2">of sugar in it now I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.810" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">calories I&#39;m consuming in a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.850" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">large cup but the effort that I do with</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">my chewing system to gain those calories</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:43.140" style="s2">is next to nil so we&#39;ve gone from this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:45.810" style="s2">tough diaper very soft dark we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.140" end="00:19:50.070" style="s2">using our tools use it or lose it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.810" end="00:19:53.550" style="s2">now I&#39;ve got a strong jaw huh how do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.070" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">get a strong jaw from using it from</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.550" end="00:20:00.620" style="s2">chewing now at the very same time</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.970" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had this gross reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.620" end="00:20:05.790" style="s2">usage use-it-or-lose-it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.970" end="00:20:08.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve also had this change in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.790" end="00:20:10.610" style="s2">posture so most children now in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.970" end="00:20:15.510" style="s2">first year of their life will have</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.610" end="00:20:18.690" style="s2">several episodes with blocked noses now</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.510" end="00:20:22.410" style="s2">that kind of is normal now and often</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.690" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">that&#39;s several days now either you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.410" end="00:20:24.930" style="s2">going to lower the tongue off the roof</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:27.570" style="s2">of your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.930" end="00:20:30.530" style="s2">separate your lips and breathe through</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.570" end="00:20:34.380" style="s2">your mouth or you&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.530" end="00:20:35.910" style="s2">there&#39;s no other way now if you do lower</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.380" end="00:20:38.220" style="s2">your tongue open your mouth and all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.910" end="00:20:40.860" style="s2">rest there&#39;s a good chance that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.220" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2">not going to go back to perfect oral</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.860" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">posture afterwards hmm what started as</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:52.230" style="s2">obligatory need has become a habit</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:55.290" style="s2">so effectively what&#39;s happened to most</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.230" end="00:20:58.170" style="s2">of modern humanity is it we&#39;ve gone from</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.290" end="00:21:00.870" style="s2">beautiful posture lips together teeth</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.170" end="00:21:03.570" style="s2">near in ear contact tongue on the roof</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.870" end="00:21:06.360" style="s2">of the mouth but good body posture and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.570" end="00:21:08.970" style="s2">good strong killing muscles to weak</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:13.110" style="s2">chewing muscles and hanging our mouths</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.970" end="00:21:16.680" style="s2">open now if you&#39;ve ever seen someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.110" end="00:21:19.970" style="s2">who&#39;s had a stroke what you notice is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.680" end="00:21:24.690" style="s2">one side of their face will drop down</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.970" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">now what I&#39;m saying is modern humanity</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.690" end="00:21:31.410" style="s2">has had a mild to moderate bilateral so</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:33.950" style="s2">we&#39;re talking both sided stroke so</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.410" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">everyone&#39;s faces have dropped down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.950" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2">as your face has got longer its got</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">narrower and shallower simple reducing</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:46.410" style="s2">the cross-sectional area and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:49.560" style="s2">where your teeth are on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.410" end="00:21:52.740" style="s2">section so less space for teeth but of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.560" end="00:21:55.770" style="s2">course less space for the airway as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.740" end="00:21:58.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s the real crux I mean root is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:22:01.710" style="s2">orbitons it&#39;s annoying it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.500" end="00:22:04.230" style="s2">treatable you can have those implants</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.370" end="00:23:20.750" style="s2">in medicine when we need to do why the</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:35.720" style="s2">could say the same thing about</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.720" end="00:23:40.010" style="s2">Darwin had never lived and there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.260" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">teach it as if Darwin had never</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:52.910" style="s2">same thing is clearly true in dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">yeah but what&#39;s difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.910" end="00:23:59.660" style="s2">is that I&#39;m seen as such a charlatan</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:02.060" style="s2">within my profession and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.660" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2">acknowledged you know I went to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.060" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">lecture and a senior professor who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:11.180" style="s2">deciding the curriculum of the largest</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:13.880" style="s2">dental school in the UK gave a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.180" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">he said many controversial points he</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.880" end="00:24:17.930" style="s2">gave a good lecture actually at the end</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">of it I was fascinated by some of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.930" end="00:24:21.590" style="s2">things he said so I went up to him and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">said look have you got some evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.590" end="00:24:27.649" style="s2">the points you&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:29.479" style="s2">now what he wanted to say was well</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.649" end="00:24:31.489" style="s2">actually we don&#39;t have very much</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.479" end="00:24:32.739" style="s2">evidence and dentistry for anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.489" end="00:24:35.059" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.739" end="00:24:37.639" style="s2">however he thought he&#39;d make a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.059" end="00:24:41.210" style="s2">quid a little joke so what he actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.639" end="00:24:44.649" style="s2">said is well we don&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.210" end="00:24:47.479" style="s2">evidence to prove that John Muse wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.649" end="00:24:49.759" style="s2">my father who came out who came out with</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.479" end="00:24:52.789" style="s2">us his start of these ideas so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.759" end="00:24:57.889" style="s2">he&#39;s using my father and affect me as</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.789" end="00:24:59.659" style="s2">the gold standard of bad science yes he</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.889" end="00:25:01.190" style="s2">started with the conclusion which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.659" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">Dalton with the conclusion and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.190" end="00:25:08.839" style="s2">guy he sets the syllabus at the largest</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:13.399" style="s2">dental school in the UK and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.839" end="00:25:15.229" style="s2">how deeply ingrained it is um and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.399" end="00:25:19.999" style="s2">know it&#39;s difficult to know where to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.229" end="00:25:23.749" style="s2">from that position yeah so again I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.999" end="00:25:26.299" style="s2">seen the same behavior in my little</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.749" end="00:25:29.330" style="s2">quadrant of the world with telomeres and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.299" end="00:25:32.749" style="s2">the damage that has been done by</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.330" end="00:25:36.409" style="s2">allowing Mouse evolution in breeding</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.749" end="00:25:39.109" style="s2">colonies to affect our models so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.409" end="00:25:41.629" style="s2">our models are all distorted in the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.109" end="00:25:43.639" style="s2">way and therefore even the progress of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.629" end="00:25:45.559" style="s2">science even a well-done experiment</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.639" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell us the right thing because</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.559" end="00:25:51.950" style="s2">it&#39;s using an animal that has evolved in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:55.849" style="s2">response to very unusual characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.950" end="00:25:58.759" style="s2">in the laboratory breeding colony so my</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.849" end="00:26:01.399" style="s2">guess would be there are hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.759" end="00:26:03.409" style="s2">stories like yours and mine things we</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.399" end="00:26:06.409" style="s2">are doing wrong because there is some</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.409" end="00:26:08.330" style="s2">school of thought that cannot consider</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.409" end="00:26:11.179" style="s2">admitting that it doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.330" end="00:26:14.659" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but these things stand</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.179" end="00:26:20.029" style="s2">in the way of progress it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.659" end="00:26:23.349" style="s2">difficult medicine and an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.029" end="00:26:26.059" style="s2">science a very difficult bedfellows I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.349" end="00:26:28.339" style="s2">found though things got harder when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.059" end="00:26:31.219" style="s2">got near medicine because there was</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.339" end="00:26:34.190" style="s2">money right you can do evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.219" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">science much more fluidly if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.190" end="00:26:37.430" style="s2">near the money but as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:40.010" style="s2">approach anything where money is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.430" end="00:26:43.550" style="s2">being made suddenly it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.010" end="00:26:47.930" style="s2">upside-down world no no we own people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.550" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">careers their status and their you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.930" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">their their income and don&#39;t get between</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">a man and his wallet yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:01.070" style="s2">although the thing that I naively</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:04.460" style="s2">thought before I had been put through</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:06.860" style="s2">the wringer myself was that although I</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.460" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">could imagine most of the people in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.860" end="00:27:12.980" style="s2">field deciding to ignore some glaring</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:15.470" style="s2">damaging error I always thought there</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.980" end="00:27:17.180" style="s2">would be renegades who would respond to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.470" end="00:27:19.580" style="s2">the fact that they could make a career</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.180" end="00:27:21.380" style="s2">by revealing what we were doing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.580" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">and making people better they could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.380" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">heroes and those people don&#39;t show up I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.950" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">mean they end up you they end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:37.100" style="s2">dismissed as a charlatan yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:39.020" style="s2">is thanks to YouTube Facebook all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.100" end="00:27:41.420" style="s2">these crazy things that have repaired</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.020" end="00:27:43.820" style="s2">out of nowhere that is the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.420" end="00:27:47.660" style="s2">that I&#39;m still working that is the only</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.820" end="00:27:49.880" style="s2">reason you even know about me and it you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.660" end="00:27:52.160" style="s2">know it were the wars previously this</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.880" end="00:27:58.610" style="s2">chokehold that medicine was able to put</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.160" end="00:28:02.120" style="s2">by being the by controlling what got</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.610" end="00:28:04.070" style="s2">published by controlling what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.120" end="00:28:06.410" style="s2">information most individuals will gain</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.070" end="00:28:09.230" style="s2">and I I give great credit to social</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.410" end="00:28:12.710" style="s2">media for at least in the short term it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.230" end="00:28:14.780" style="s2">has broken the stranglehold well the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.710" end="00:28:17.870" style="s2">name of this podcast is the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.780" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">podcast for a reason which is that now</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.870" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">we can bring to light all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">things that would have been true and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.590" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">would have been known by a tiny number</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.210" end="00:28:28.610" style="s2">of people before but now we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:31.910" style="s2">bring attention to them and those people</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.610" end="00:28:35.330" style="s2">like you like me weird Dark Horse&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.910" end="00:28:39.410" style="s2">we are yeah I guess I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.330" end="00:28:42.050" style="s2">reason I chose that name so well oh go</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.410" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">ahead I was just gonna say that it you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.050" end="00:28:48.830" style="s2">know for me I you know I I think what</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:51.110" style="s2">one of the turning points for me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.830" end="00:28:54.800" style="s2">really focus I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.110" end="00:28:58.220" style="s2">oh just completed a marriage</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:29:01.550" style="s2">so I was at the end of a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.220" end="00:29:04.040" style="s2">phase of my life and it was seeing my</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.550" end="00:29:06.110" style="s2">father and the rejection he&#39;d got and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.040" end="00:29:07.010" style="s2">just decided you know I&#39;d had one foot</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.010" end="00:29:12.140" style="s2">Offutt robux what I was doing and I had</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">more time doing conventional</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.140" end="00:29:17.410" style="s2">orthodontics mainly on adults so that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:20.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t hypocritical within my soul and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.410" end="00:29:22.190" style="s2">then it was what to my father and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.390" end="00:29:26.060" style="s2">difficulties he was had made me said</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.060" end="00:29:33.860" style="s2">money even if all I do is make a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.440" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">people a little bit better I have got to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.860" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">focus on doing this something I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.790" end="00:31:17.930" style="s2">country and I see these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.500" end="00:31:24.530" style="s2">distorted craniofacial forms I see</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.930" end="00:31:28.730" style="s2">people who have all kinds of forms and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.530" end="00:31:33.700" style="s2">shapes and I know how badly that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.730" end="00:31:38.120" style="s2">affecting their general health and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.700" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">that just it actually scares me because</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">I know that every year this is getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:45.980" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:47.330" style="s2">again in my opinion I have to say this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.980" end="00:31:50.990" style="s2">all the time because I said anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.330" end="00:31:54.350" style="s2">wrong people are out hunting so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.990" end="00:31:57.380" style="s2">talking about an incalculable level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.350" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">harm did be really know calculating if</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.380" end="00:32:02.540" style="s2">you think of them as know calculate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:05.810" style="s2">degradation okay inquire yeah I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.540" end="00:32:09.050" style="s2">what percentage of the health care costs</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.810" end="00:32:13.580" style="s2">are from a downswing and facial form and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.050" end="00:32:15.410" style="s2">the subsequent so quale as other effects</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">of that on the general health over</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.410" end="00:32:22.190" style="s2">particularly over a period of time so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:25.490" style="s2">that is a I have to say there there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.190" end="00:32:28.790" style="s2">something tragic about the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.490" end="00:32:31.220" style="s2">walk around and can see this in each</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.790" end="00:32:33.470" style="s2">person that you pass and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.220" end="00:32:36.440" style="s2">think your analogies are very apt you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.470" end="00:32:39.290" style="s2">say you see car wreck after car wreck</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.440" end="00:32:42.200" style="s2">like bad reconstructive surgery you see</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.290" end="00:32:44.780" style="s2">people who have the downstream effect</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.200" end="00:32:49.430" style="s2">that would be caused by a stroke right</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.780" end="00:32:51.950" style="s2">these are not so much yeah so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.430" end="00:32:54.560" style="s2">saying is that as your face drops down</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.950" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">on back it&#39;s gonna force you into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.560" end="00:32:59.960" style="s2">forward head posture yep I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:01.520" style="s2">yes we are spending a lot of time on</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.960" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">these devices</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.520" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">all right we&#39;re spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">on screens yeah and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:10.580" style="s2">good for body posture but a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:14.630" style="s2">is the fact that if your face has</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.580" end="00:33:16.910" style="s2">dropped down on back and almost every</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.630" end="00:33:20.210" style="s2">single person</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.910" end="00:33:23.570" style="s2">listening to this podcast has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.210" end="00:33:28.820" style="s2">affected and probably to quite a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.570" end="00:33:30.920" style="s2">significant extent uh and so as your</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.820" end="00:33:34.220" style="s2">face drops down a back you have to hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.920" end="00:33:35.870" style="s2">your head forward you are reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.220" end="00:33:38.450" style="s2">cross-sectional area you&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.870" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">your chance of sleep apnea George oink</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.450" end="00:33:44.300" style="s2">problems most of the ENT problems are</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">worsened because you know a structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.300" end="00:33:52.750" style="s2">that does not have the right</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.060" end="00:34:04.580" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of health problems and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.090" end="00:34:07.010" style="s2">know it&#39;s the is the sleep apnea is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.580" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">always going to be the biggest one but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.010" end="00:34:12.169" style="s2">I have suspicions about several other</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.550" style="s2">things that I&#39;m not making public I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.169" end="00:34:17.210" style="s2">not shouting about it because it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.550" end="00:34:20.870" style="s2">sounds too incredible it sounds too</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.210" end="00:34:23.270" style="s2">ridiculous is there any chance that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.870" end="00:34:24.980" style="s2">want to quietly and privately share with</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.270" end="00:34:27.620" style="s2">me and a couple hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.980" end="00:34:29.540" style="s2">who are gonna see this it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.620" end="00:34:33.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what I&#39;m not concerned about I</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.540" end="00:34:36.919" style="s2">call this the name I came up the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.980" end="00:34:39.500" style="s2">day is carotid constriction so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.919" end="00:34:42.980" style="s2">related to the carotid sheath so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.500" end="00:34:48.470" style="s2">just saying that you know my concern is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.980" end="00:34:50.330" style="s2">that as the face drops down and back see</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.470" end="00:34:52.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like a waxwork model</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.330" end="00:34:59.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got too close to the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.370" end="00:35:00.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve just and as it occurs yes your</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.240" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">tongue moves closer to your airway and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.950" end="00:35:06.730" style="s2">yes you&#39;re leading to more sleep apnea</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:11.090" style="s2">but of course also your this bulk is</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.730" end="00:35:14.360" style="s2">squeezing the carotid sheath now I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.090" end="00:35:16.970" style="s2">fascinated by a an Italian chap I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.360" end="00:35:21.890" style="s2">even try to say his surname who was</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.970" end="00:35:24.590" style="s2">treating ms by putting stents in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.890" end="00:35:28.570" style="s2">jugular vein and what he was saying is</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.590" end="00:35:30.680" style="s2">that blood is pooling in the lower brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.570" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">hindbrain and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.680" end="00:35:35.270" style="s2">it&#39;s unable to get out of the hindbrain</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">as well as it should be able to do and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.270" end="00:35:42.230" style="s2">by helping this blood to drain he was</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:45.770" style="s2">putting a multiple sclerosis into</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.230" end="00:35:47.690" style="s2">remission Wow amazing and I like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.770" end="00:35:49.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s that interested me and I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.690" end="00:35:52.220" style="s2">looking at the work of someone called</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.370" end="00:35:56.840" style="s2">Brendan stack and because what medicine</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.220" end="00:35:58.370" style="s2">loves to do is ignore outliers it takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.840" end="00:36:01.730" style="s2">them as oh well that&#39;s a random event</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.370" end="00:36:03.350" style="s2">and well if you stop to look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.730" end="00:36:05.870" style="s2">the random events sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.350" end="00:36:07.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a whiff of something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.870" end="00:36:10.670" style="s2">in many of them and you don&#39;t ignore</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.700" end="00:36:13.400" style="s2">them try and make sense of them but what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.670" end="00:36:15.950" style="s2">I&#39;m Brendan stack was doing was taking</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.400" end="00:36:18.110" style="s2">people who would arrive in wheelchairs</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.950" end="00:36:19.940" style="s2">he would build them up with appliances</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.110" end="00:36:22.370" style="s2">in the mouth that opened their mouth up</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.940" end="00:36:27.110" style="s2">and they would get out the wheelchairs</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.370" end="00:36:29.000" style="s2">and walk and I thought wow I hear from</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.110" end="00:36:32.360" style="s2">other people that this effect wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.000" end="00:36:35.870" style="s2">permanent however in the short term it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.360" end="00:36:37.460" style="s2">was fantastic now I was sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.870" end="00:36:41.090" style="s2">trying to make sense of this when I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.460" end="00:36:44.510" style="s2">heard of this Italian doctor and these</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.090" end="00:36:46.760" style="s2">made sense because the types of that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.510" end="00:36:48.710" style="s2">delay that Brendan was seeing was just</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.760" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">about right for a blood effect and a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.710" end="00:36:56.360" style="s2">blog neurological effect and so my idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:59.360" style="s2">is that what&#39;s happening is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.360" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">in the people who were attempting to use</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.360" end="00:37:05.990" style="s2">certain muscles in this area to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:08.390" style="s2">and maintain an open airway who lacks</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.990" end="00:37:11.570" style="s2">space because their faces drop down</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.390" end="00:37:15.500" style="s2">they&#39;re constricting the internal</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.570" end="00:37:17.720" style="s2">jugular and that is leading to this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.500" end="00:37:20.410" style="s2">with the suggestion where this is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.720" end="00:37:24.020" style="s2">think the link between Alzheimer&#39;s and</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.670" end="00:37:35.420" style="s2">know these takes people have you know</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.420" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got a tick you know those</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.670" end="00:37:40.670" style="s2">are any suggestions um</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:42.980" style="s2">and also one of the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.670" end="00:37:45.380" style="s2">fascinated me was you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.980" end="00:37:47.450" style="s2">I remember going to Thailand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.380" end="00:37:49.910" style="s2">where I first qualified and everyone had</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.450" end="00:37:51.859" style="s2">beautiful skin and straight teeth then I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.910" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">went back a few years later on I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.859" end="00:37:57.859" style="s2">a few people had braces and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:38:00.200" style="s2">amongst the few people with braces that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.859" end="00:38:03.619" style="s2">he also had some facial acne and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.200" end="00:38:07.270" style="s2">facial acne was limited precisely to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.619" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">drainage of the lymphatics from the face</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.270" end="00:38:13.730" style="s2">now that lymphatics is also going down</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:14.839" style="s2">that same carotid sheath so my</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.730" end="00:38:16.430" style="s2">suggestion is we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.839" end="00:38:19.430" style="s2">constriction on the carotid sheath</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.430" end="00:38:21.980" style="s2">that&#39;s leading to other problems but</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.430" end="00:38:25.220" style="s2">again you know I want to hold back</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.980" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">because you know I don&#39;t want to sound</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.220" end="00:38:29.420" style="s2">like I&#39;ve got the cure to everything no</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.240" style="s2">no you don&#39;t worry you&#39;re among friends</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.420" end="00:38:33.890" style="s2">here this story makes a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.240" end="00:38:36.530" style="s2">sense to me which doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.890" end="00:38:39.829" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it right or wrong but I know</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.530" end="00:38:42.920" style="s2">this style of thought is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.829" end="00:38:44.630" style="s2">solves big problems lots of stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.920" end="00:38:47.270" style="s2">going to be downstream of the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.630" end="00:38:49.310" style="s2">single error and trying to listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.270" end="00:38:52.250" style="s2">outliers will tell you how it works yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.310" end="00:38:54.440" style="s2">and also the other thing going down this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.250" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">carotid sheath of course is the vagus</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.440" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">nerve and of course if you squeeze the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:04.069" style="s2">vagus nerve you&#39;re going to ramp up your</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">sympathetic system and what do we notice</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.069" end="00:39:08.569" style="s2">and so many people today they ramped up</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">their sympathetic system the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.569" end="00:39:13.099" style="s2">parasympathetic calming effect from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.589" style="s2">vagus nerve all the way they call it the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.099" end="00:39:17.990" style="s2">vagus because it&#39;s the Vagabond it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.589" end="00:39:19.880" style="s2">travel it just goes off all the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.990" end="00:39:25.430" style="s2">around your body particularly to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.880" end="00:39:27.380" style="s2">internal organs calming them down and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.430" end="00:39:29.300" style="s2">think that and the problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.380" end="00:39:32.329" style="s2">whole thing is that if you put someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.300" end="00:39:36.050" style="s2">in you lie them flat to put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.329" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">scanner you ain&#39;t gonna see it because</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.050" end="00:39:41.000" style="s2">it&#39;s only affecting when you stand or</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:44.420" style="s2">you&#39;re supine and you&#39;re engaging these</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.000" end="00:39:46.130" style="s2">muscles to maintain an airway that story</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.420" end="00:39:48.589" style="s2">also makes sense to me that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.130" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">bias in the way we study things and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.589" end="00:39:54.619" style="s2">is predictable that anything that runs</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:56.539" style="s2">afoul of that bias will be mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.619" end="00:40:00.109" style="s2">for much longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.539" end="00:40:03.939" style="s2">right anything you can see lying down</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.109" end="00:40:03.939" style="s2">will not be discovered by this method</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.209" end="00:40:09.589" style="s2">that&#39;s what we sometimes don&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.189" end="00:40:12.679" style="s2">there seems to be a lack of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.589" end="00:40:15.130" style="s2">when you look at um astrophysics</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.679" end="00:40:17.989" style="s2">astrophysics is divided into two sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.130" end="00:40:22.269" style="s2">groups you have your experimenters and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.989" end="00:40:26.089" style="s2">your theorists and it&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.269" end="00:40:29.719" style="s2">science where people are pushing</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.089" end="00:40:31.999" style="s2">forwards ideas ideas change is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.719" end="00:40:36.589" style="s2">what would from this tiny little speck</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.999" end="00:40:39.140" style="s2">in the back waters of one galaxy we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.589" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">managed to work out an incredible amount</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.140" end="00:40:43.309" style="s2">about our galaxy well we&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.349" style="s2">with this mixture of experimenters and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.309" end="00:40:50.390" style="s2">theorists when it comes to medicine</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.349" end="00:40:52.369" style="s2">where are the theorists well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.390" end="00:40:55.400" style="s2">probably worked this out yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.369" end="00:40:57.529" style="s2">Alan tiny in my field there are no</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.400" end="00:41:00.650" style="s2">theorists and the reason that there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.529" end="00:41:02.689" style="s2">no theorists is pure economics right</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.650" end="00:41:05.419" style="s2">theorists are the key to moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.689" end="00:41:08.239" style="s2">evolutionary biology forward but what</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.419" end="00:41:10.179" style="s2">we&#39;ve got is a system in which the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.239" end="00:41:13.009" style="s2">incentives inside the university</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.179" end="00:41:15.979" style="s2">prioritize expensive experiments which</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.009" end="00:41:18.259" style="s2">require big grants because the overhead</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.979" end="00:41:20.509" style="s2">goes to the University and it builds the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.259" end="00:41:22.609" style="s2">buildings and all of that a theorist who</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.509" end="00:41:25.099" style="s2">basically needs pencils and access to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.609" end="00:41:26.959" style="s2">the library doesn&#39;t bring in big grants</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.099" end="00:41:28.939" style="s2">and so the university doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.959" end="00:41:31.819" style="s2">fill a spot with them so what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.939" end="00:41:33.769" style="s2">is we&#39;ve had a kind of a coup where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.819" end="00:41:35.419" style="s2">empiricists have taken over and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.769" end="00:41:37.669" style="s2">nothing wrong with empiricists we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.419" end="00:41:40.059" style="s2">them but you need them paired with</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.669" end="00:41:43.369" style="s2">theorists and so instead of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.059" end="00:41:45.909" style="s2">we say well theory is something you do</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.369" end="00:41:48.619" style="s2">in your spare time once you&#39;ve done your</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.909" end="00:41:50.479" style="s2">empirical work which of course turns the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.619" end="00:41:52.459" style="s2">philosophy of science on its head and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.479" end="00:41:54.279" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that says a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.459" end="00:41:57.259" style="s2">empiricist is gonna be a good theorist</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.279" end="00:41:59.449" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna be you can&#39;t be someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.259" end="00:42:02.059" style="s2">else on your part time right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.449" end="00:42:03.829" style="s2">hobby theorist is a hard job it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.059" end="00:42:07.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look the same as running</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.829" end="00:42:08.140" style="s2">experiments so it sounds like but go</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.609" end="00:42:10.430" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.140" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">what we do we&#39;ve got so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.430" end="00:42:17.630" style="s2">facts you know III I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.440" end="00:42:20.059" style="s2">research is coming up with the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.630" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">answers I&#39;m saying we&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.059" end="00:42:25.970" style="s2">reflecting on the facts we&#39;ve got and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:27.619" style="s2">trying to make sense of them there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.970" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">lack of discussion there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.619" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">logic and the problem as you said you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:37.970" style="s2">know this is this empirical basis of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:40.010" style="s2">evidence as being above it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.970" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">was not being reflected on it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.010" end="00:42:46.730" style="s2">being considered you and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:50.300" style="s2">need badly yes we need so the way I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.730" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">think of it is synthesis right synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.300" end="00:42:57.500" style="s2">is the act of taking data generated in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:43:00.020" style="s2">experiments and combining it with theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.500" end="00:43:04.099" style="s2">and figuring out what the new model is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.020" end="00:43:07.339" style="s2">and when you so these phrases like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.099" end="00:43:09.890" style="s2">what do the data say right our data is</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.339" end="00:43:11.809" style="s2">king these things sounds so right</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.890" end="00:43:13.849" style="s2">because they sound like an embrace of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.809" end="00:43:16.670" style="s2">the idea of empirical science but</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.849" end="00:43:19.490" style="s2">they&#39;re actually part of an overthrow of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.670" end="00:43:22.210" style="s2">theory by empiricism which is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.490" end="00:43:25.160" style="s2">science that&#39;s just observation so</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.210" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a chronic problem and its</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.160" end="00:43:30.250" style="s2">route is so mundane that nobody even</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:33.559" style="s2">notices it which is the way we&#39;ve fund</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.250" end="00:43:36.380" style="s2">universities is about experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.559" end="00:43:38.750" style="s2">cost money and so the administrators</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.380" end="00:43:41.180" style="s2">have gotten so efficient that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.750" end="00:43:43.970" style="s2">think clearly anymore it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.180" end="00:43:46.970" style="s2">disaster yes I mean we do have slightly</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.970" end="00:43:49.430" style="s2">different structures here in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.970" end="00:43:50.690" style="s2">probably not so much in the university</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.430" end="00:43:55.190" style="s2">but when it comes to providing</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.570" end="00:44:39.830" style="s2">know you can&#39;t prove anything you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.480" end="00:44:42.860" style="s2">only disprove things and trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.830" end="00:44:46.850" style="s2">certain that this never escaped medicine</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.860" end="00:44:48.980" style="s2">medicine never went back to prove it he</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.850" end="00:44:51.080" style="s2">put the null hypothesis so I&#39;d be his</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.980" end="00:44:53.090" style="s2">group made the null hypothesis and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.080" end="00:44:55.540" style="s2">put the null hypothesis so whenever you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.090" end="00:45:00.770" style="s2">make a scientific paper you try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.540" end="00:45:02.840" style="s2">disprove the null hypothesis yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.770" end="00:45:05.330" style="s2">try to falsify the null hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.840" end="00:45:07.700" style="s2">however of course we now just have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.330" end="00:45:11.720" style="s2">null hypothesis and we have completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.700" end="00:45:13.880" style="s2">forgotten why we had the null hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.720" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">it seems an almost an irrelevance you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.880" end="00:45:16.820" style="s2">know I asked sometimes you know tom has</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:17.990" style="s2">done some research if I&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.820" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">conference and I&#39;m walking around</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.990" end="00:45:23.150" style="s2">amongst the posters and I will do my</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:25.550" style="s2">sort of annoying spot conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.150" end="00:45:27.470" style="s2">someone on what was a null hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.550" end="00:45:29.510" style="s2">for why did you do that what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.470" end="00:45:33.560" style="s2">history of that what well how did that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:35.480" style="s2">come into science hmm right they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.560" end="00:45:37.490" style="s2">skipped the philosophy of science and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.480" end="00:45:39.500" style="s2">then they&#39;ve told themselves lies about</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.490" end="00:45:42.350" style="s2">why it&#39;s no longer necessary and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.500" end="00:45:43.510" style="s2">got more sophisticated methods it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.350" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.510" end="00:45:51.620" style="s2">yeah I mean I think that you know I you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:56.300" style="s2">know we will look at the world for what</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.620" end="00:46:01.400" style="s2">own position now I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.300" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">medicines lack of how do we say this so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.400" end="00:46:07.610" style="s2">the craniofacial dystrophy and its</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:11.870" style="s2">effects and the fact that from inaction</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.610" end="00:46:17.650" style="s2">and from the wrong action has possibly</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.870" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">caused a issue of historic significance</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.650" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">you know I see this it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:26.780" style="s2">utterly incredible in my viewpoint the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:30.440" style="s2">sequence of health effects that have</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.780" end="00:46:33.350" style="s2">been caused that I think are completely</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.440" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">preventable completely convertible</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.350" end="00:46:39.720" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:41.580" style="s2">in my viewpoint this is going to rattle</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.720" end="00:46:49.410" style="s2">on getting bigger and bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.580" end="00:46:51.930" style="s2">and from this it&#39;s going to give the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.410" end="00:46:53.700" style="s2">ability or the the the the the situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.930" end="00:46:56.970" style="s2">where we could gain some real change and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.700" end="00:46:58.500" style="s2">I mean I guess that&#39;s what Karl Popper</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.970" end="00:47:01.710" style="s2">was thinking when you put the null</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.500" end="00:47:03.660" style="s2">hypothesis in however I really look</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.710" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">forward to the ability of trying to gain</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.660" end="00:47:10.890" style="s2">some good proper sensible change in</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:11.730" style="s2">medicine so let me ask you about a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.890" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">couple things</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.730" end="00:47:17.369" style="s2">one I have a hypothesis almost certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:20.390" style="s2">to be wrong but you&#39;re probably the only</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.369" end="00:47:23.340" style="s2">person on earth worth running it by I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.390" end="00:47:26.420" style="s2">was wondering one of the things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.340" end="00:47:31.250" style="s2">think we have great information on is</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.420" end="00:47:34.890" style="s2">how our ancestors slept we have some</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.250" end="00:47:37.140" style="s2">information on how people sleep even</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.890" end="00:47:39.060" style="s2">hunter-gatherers in modern times but a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.140" end="00:47:42.540" style="s2">lot of the information I believe has</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.060" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">been lost I&#39;m wondering about the effect</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.540" end="00:47:50.970" style="s2">of sleeping on pillows with your face</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:54.590" style="s2">down potentially or your head cocked to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.970" end="00:48:00.119" style="s2">the side is that having an effect on</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.590" end="00:48:04.650" style="s2">malocclusion yeah I really and I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.119" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">suggest that if you have an asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.650" end="00:48:12.810" style="s2">position where you routinely sleep yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:15.150" style="s2">it could have an effect however is one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.810" end="00:48:18.090" style="s2">of those things where I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.150" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">enough information and I&#39;m sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.090" end="00:48:23.990" style="s2">the fence processing at the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">know I&#39;m seeing some of those Egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.990" end="00:48:29.490" style="s2">things I mean it would you know you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">these Egyptians have these ceremonial</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.490" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">things that were a bit sort of like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:38.190" style="s2">a little bit shorter about like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:39.690" style="s2">fight I think there were cut on one side</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.190" end="00:48:43.170" style="s2">that they would put behind their heads</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.690" end="00:48:45.300" style="s2">when they slept that was emulated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.170" end="00:48:48.450" style="s2">quite a few different cultures and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.300" end="00:48:49.650" style="s2">idea of a pillow and resting your head</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.450" end="00:48:52.080" style="s2">on something</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.650" end="00:48:54.630" style="s2">seems to be really deep in literature</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.080" end="00:48:58.050" style="s2">you know really quite deep in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:49:01.470" style="s2">literature and and fables as well which</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.050" end="00:49:04.110" style="s2">is interesting my sister is a physio</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.470" end="00:49:06.150" style="s2">when she says to me that one of the good</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.110" end="00:49:09.360" style="s2">things of sleeping on a hard surface is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.150" end="00:49:11.460" style="s2">how you have to move around so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.360" end="00:49:13.980" style="s2">not you&#39;re not in one position you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.460" end="00:49:15.750" style="s2">physically having to move then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.980" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">looking at the you know you go into</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.750" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">ancient churches and kneel or even</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:21.540" style="s2">fairly modern churches in India you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.930" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">have these reliefs of people so these</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.540" end="00:49:28.140" style="s2">are mortals or statues of people lying</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">down often with their sword right down</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.140" end="00:49:34.770" style="s2">in front of them suggesting you&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:37.230" style="s2">on your back I remember going to I had</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.770" end="00:49:39.720" style="s2">the the chance to go traveling before</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.230" end="00:49:42.030" style="s2">the internet and before everyone else on</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.720" end="00:49:45.320" style="s2">their dog decided to go traveling and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.030" end="00:49:51.000" style="s2">was a fascinating period and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.320" end="00:49:54.450" style="s2">going to this particular event I was in</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.000" end="00:49:57.300" style="s2">South America and I was amazed how</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.450" end="00:50:01.710" style="s2">people would just lie and sleep</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.300" end="00:50:03.660" style="s2">sometimes across their goods so if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.710" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">had a bag of stuff you wanted to take to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.660" end="00:50:08.310" style="s2">the market you didn&#39;t want someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:11.700" style="s2">nicking your stuff while you&#39;re asleep</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.310" end="00:50:14.550" style="s2">so you would sleep on it in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.700" end="00:50:17.580" style="s2">bent fashion or a twisted fashion and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.550" end="00:50:20.460" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get over how these sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.580" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">relatively mature people were it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.460" end="00:50:25.590" style="s2">so flexible by they slept and it just</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:27.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to fit with the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.590" end="00:50:29.310" style="s2">pattern we&#39;re seeing where Mannion if</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.600" end="00:50:31.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a beautiful mattress</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.310" end="00:50:32.910" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna throw your back out well</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.320" end="00:50:34.830" style="s2">these guys were sitting bent over</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.910" end="00:50:36.950" style="s2">backwards with their legs twisted norm</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.830" end="00:50:40.020" style="s2">one side and their head like that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.950" end="00:50:41.550" style="s2">seemed thoughtful asleep perfectly fast</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.020" end="00:50:44.340" style="s2">asleep and I didn&#39;t see anyone wearing</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.550" end="00:50:46.530" style="s2">neck braces yes their muscles are</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.340" end="00:50:48.810" style="s2">protecting their skeletons whereas ours</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.530" end="00:50:51.360" style="s2">have atrophied because our sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.810" end="00:50:53.430" style="s2">surfaces are too soft yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.360" end="00:50:58.490" style="s2">there was a distinct lack of mattresses</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.430" end="00:50:58.490" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah mattresses oh yeah frankly</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.520" end="00:51:02.910" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make life soft because</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.410" end="00:51:06.809" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.910" end="00:51:09.269" style="s2">from being soft I had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.809" end="00:51:12.269" style="s2">intuition and at one point considered</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.269" end="00:51:14.519" style="s2">whether I would just simply be</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.269" end="00:51:17.519" style="s2">considered crazy if we got rid of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.519" end="00:51:19.319" style="s2">beds and moved to hammocks because once</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.519" end="00:51:21.210" style="s2">you figure out a hammock it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.319" end="00:51:23.880" style="s2">quite a good way to sleep I mean from a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.210" end="00:51:26.069" style="s2">lot of perspectives from a thermal</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.880" end="00:51:28.980" style="s2">perspective it was interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.069" end="00:51:31.799" style="s2">remember when the sailors used to use</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.980" end="00:51:34.589" style="s2">hammocks they would have a cushion that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.799" end="00:51:36.359" style="s2">would be semicircular to sort of flatten</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.589" end="00:51:38.339" style="s2">it out a little bit and I&#39;m not a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.359" end="00:51:40.890" style="s2">deal I don&#39;t know but so they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.339" end="00:51:44.069" style="s2">trying in that era to sleep on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.890" end="00:51:46.589" style="s2">slightly flatter surface yeah well more</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.069" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">yoga like my thoughts would be sleep on</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.589" end="00:51:53.730" style="s2">the floor well the thing about a hammock</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:51:56.430" style="s2">is Anna may not be as easy on a ship I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.730" end="00:51:58.369" style="s2">have to think about the geometry but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.430" end="00:52:01.470" style="s2">way to use a hammock is actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.369" end="00:52:03.690" style="s2">diagonally right so you are flattered</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.470" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">you&#39;d you know that you say it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.690" end="00:52:08.369" style="s2">quite right but if you sleep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:09.900" style="s2">across it it works out very well it</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.369" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">takes some getting used to but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.900" end="00:52:16.289" style="s2">lot to recommend it yeah but but I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:18.809" style="s2">tried with patients getting them and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.289" end="00:52:20.519" style="s2">always say you know I have to caveat all</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.809" end="00:52:23.130" style="s2">these suggestions before everyone</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.519" end="00:52:26.369" style="s2">listening goes out and does it that with</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.130" end="00:52:29.009" style="s2">some supervision so preferably some</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.369" end="00:52:30.900" style="s2">professional help you just start</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.009" end="00:52:32.789" style="s2">sleeping on the floor you know you start</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.900" end="00:52:34.500" style="s2">by going down and we call them carry</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.789" end="00:52:36.869" style="s2">mats the sort of things you would go</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.500" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">camping on you know get three of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.869" end="00:52:42.450" style="s2">maybe four stop with that then gently</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:45.539" style="s2">take them away um you know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.450" end="00:52:47.339" style="s2">time it&#39;s because your skull your is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.539" end="00:52:50.190" style="s2">what your vertebra have become so</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.339" end="00:52:54.299" style="s2">distorted it&#39;s going to take time to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.190" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">unwind that and level everything out you</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.299" end="00:52:58.410" style="s2">know if you see someone who&#39;s hunched</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:01.950" style="s2">over all the time their vertebra will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.410" end="00:53:04.710" style="s2">wade shaped and that person can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.950" end="00:53:06.869" style="s2">suddenly sleep on the floor it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.710" end="00:53:10.769" style="s2">take a little bit of slow manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.869" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">to get your vertebra fairly square again</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.769" end="00:53:16.810" style="s2">and that you know a but a floor is an</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.960" style="s2">excellent way</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.810" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">to start exhibiting change so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.960" end="00:53:28.330" style="s2">sleep on a floor then you&#39;ve got in</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:30.520" style="s2">eight hours of training every day every</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.330" end="00:53:35.590" style="s2">24-hour period you&#39;ve got a third of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.520" end="00:53:37.270" style="s2">based on training to be straight and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.590" end="00:53:39.070" style="s2">bread one one other thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.270" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">either this when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.070" end="00:53:44.980" style="s2">prevention um you know the exercise I</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:48.580" style="s2">try and get people to do a mealtime</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.980" end="00:53:50.460" style="s2">exercise and I say that we want a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.580" end="00:53:53.380" style="s2">positional exercise because a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.460" end="00:53:55.120" style="s2">situational exercise sorry because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.380" end="00:53:57.670" style="s2">great year you can go to my function</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.120" end="00:53:59.110" style="s2">therapists uh or or mammalogists and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.670" end="00:54:02.350" style="s2">they&#39;ll teach you how to do a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.110" end="00:54:04.270" style="s2">swallow but most kids learn the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.350" end="00:54:06.690" style="s2">swallow but they never really do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.270" end="00:54:09.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s an it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.690" end="00:54:11.380" style="s2">compartmentalised these exercises so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.370" end="00:54:13.420" style="s2">what I&#39;m suggesting is people have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.380" end="00:54:14.950" style="s2">mealtime exercise because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.420" end="00:54:16.930" style="s2">situational they&#39;re going to be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.950" end="00:54:23.340" style="s2">on a meal and the exercise I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.930" end="00:54:25.360" style="s2">and this works its elbows off the table</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.340" end="00:54:29.620" style="s2">sit up straight</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.360" end="00:54:33.010" style="s2">eat with your mouth closed chew your</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.620" end="00:54:36.520" style="s2">food properly don&#39;t speak when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.010" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">eating and take your food food comes to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.520" end="00:54:41.080" style="s2">you not you to your food the only other</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">thing I add is you&#39;ve got to throw a</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.080" end="00:54:44.890" style="s2">chin tuck because most people have got</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:49.450" style="s2">forward head posture so I make them</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.890" end="00:54:56.170" style="s2">turned up when they swallow now not much</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.450" end="00:55:01.510" style="s2">of that is new and when you stop and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.170" end="00:55:07.710" style="s2">reflect almost every single culture on</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.510" end="00:55:14.380" style="s2">the planet recommend and has recommended</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.710" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">exactly this for generations and there</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.380" end="00:55:20.830" style="s2">is a reason for everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:23.710" style="s2">and because it works and I think we we</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.830" end="00:55:26.410" style="s2">had this period between the end of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.710" end="00:55:29.980" style="s2">hunter-gathering when we became</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.410" end="00:55:33.460" style="s2">subsistence farmers before we</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.980" end="00:55:36.940" style="s2">started to really civilize I mean really</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.460" end="00:55:40.540" style="s2">the industrial ushion when things</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.940" end="00:55:43.390" style="s2">weren&#39;t so bad you could go wrong but if</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.540" end="00:55:46.510" style="s2">you followed some simple rules some</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.390" end="00:55:48.460" style="s2">dictums then you could gain him you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.510" end="00:55:50.680" style="s2">could make certain that your child would</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.460" end="00:55:52.900" style="s2">grow to be straight and before we had</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.680" end="00:55:55.630" style="s2">modern medicine you you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.900" end="00:55:57.400" style="s2">anything to fall back on so you had to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.630" end="00:56:00.390" style="s2">do it yourself for your child because</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.400" end="00:56:03.490" style="s2">your child was going to be your pension</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.390" end="00:56:06.850" style="s2">so you know you made your your child sit</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.490" end="00:56:09.340" style="s2">up straight and of course you still have</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.850" end="00:56:12.190" style="s2">that possibility that things would go</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.340" end="00:56:13.869" style="s2">wrong now we talk about the the village</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.190" end="00:56:16.210" style="s2">idiot right</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.869" end="00:56:19.780" style="s2">who was the village well we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.210" end="00:56:23.530" style="s2">idea of in eight years and sort of with</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.780" end="00:56:27.790" style="s2">the ear sticking out that&#39;s the classic</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.530" end="00:56:31.390" style="s2">adenoidal face hmm here the tongue</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.790" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">attached behind the mandibular symphysis</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.390" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">you know this bit has swung down to</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:39.220" style="s2">alter airway will we know that one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">the most sadistic significant</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.220" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">measurements for sleep apnea is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:48.220" style="s2">distance between here and the back of</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:49.540" style="s2">the throat short of that distance the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.220" end="00:56:52.540" style="s2">higher the chance you are of getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.540" end="00:56:55.859" style="s2">sleep apnea we know that if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.540" end="00:57:00.600" style="s2">an abnormal face that distance reduced</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.859" end="00:57:03.420" style="s2">we know that people with significant</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.600" end="00:57:06.220" style="s2">sleep apnea when their children are</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.420" end="00:57:10.750" style="s2">affect their brains don&#39;t grow as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.220" end="00:57:14.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s well shown hmm so here we</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.750" end="00:57:17.980" style="s2">have the village idiot someone that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.410" end="00:57:21.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t do the right thing and it won</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.980" end="00:57:23.410" style="s2">today you don&#39;t notice the village idiot</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.250" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">because almost everyone looks similar</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.410" end="00:57:30.580" style="s2">but a couple of hundred years ago they</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">stood out like a sore thumb and there</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.580" end="00:57:37.150" style="s2">the parents could go I don&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:39.930" style="s2">end up like that the wind will change in</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.150" end="00:57:42.760" style="s2">your face will set like that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.930" end="00:57:45.490" style="s2">right these are</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.760" end="00:57:48.580" style="s2">so I have a category that I call</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.490" end="00:57:50.970" style="s2">literally false metaphorically true and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.580" end="00:57:53.470" style="s2">these are beliefs that are not accurate</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.970" end="00:57:55.750" style="s2">but if you behave as if they&#39;re accurate</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.470" end="00:57:57.130" style="s2">you do better than you would if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.750" end="00:57:59.830" style="s2">behave according to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.130" end="00:58:01.650" style="s2">they&#39;re false and so the idea that your</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.830" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">face will freeze in this position isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.650" end="00:58:05.859" style="s2">mechanistically right but it means that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:09.010" style="s2">if you keep doing that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.859" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">habitual and it&#39;s the equivalent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.010" end="00:58:16.090" style="s2">yeah you know I mean it&#39;s you know there</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:20.020" style="s2">is there is wisdom in certain cultural</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.090" end="00:58:21.840" style="s2">things I am saying little more than</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.020" end="00:58:25.090" style="s2">stand up straight and shut your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.840" end="00:58:26.890" style="s2">look well you&#39;re saying a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.090" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">you&#39;re saying the way to avoid this</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.890" end="00:58:30.780" style="s2">problem in the first place is to behave</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:32.260" style="s2">in a way that your</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.780" end="00:58:33.970" style="s2">great-great-grandmother would have</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.260" end="00:58:36.540" style="s2">understood to be the right way to behave</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.970" end="00:58:38.980" style="s2">in the first place but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.540" end="00:58:41.350" style="s2">successful at treating people who have</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.980" end="00:58:43.720" style="s2">quite distorted faces I&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.350" end="00:58:49.080" style="s2">before and after picture pictures I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.720" end="00:58:53.260" style="s2">shown you have not seen anything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.080" end="00:58:55.960" style="s2">I&#39;m holding back evidence for the right</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.260" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">moment I mean I&#39;m getting much better</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.960" end="00:59:00.609" style="s2">I&#39;m constantly getting better and better</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:03.670" style="s2">and I got some adult results so did I</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.609" end="00:59:07.570" style="s2">put them out I&#39;d be just I&#39;d be a riot</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.670" end="00:59:09.940" style="s2">well I&#39;m there Bobbi were yo because we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.570" end="00:59:12.730" style="s2">are achieving things that people just</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.940" end="00:59:16.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t think was possible it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.730" end="00:59:20.020" style="s2">if the world doesn&#39;t want to believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.210" end="00:59:22.210" style="s2">that their facial form is malleable you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.020" end="00:59:25.869" style="s2">know that image that looks back to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.210" end="00:59:27.369" style="s2">from any mirror in the world I mean who</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.869" end="00:59:29.859" style="s2">are you back you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.369" end="00:59:32.380" style="s2">if someone asks to meet you who are you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.859" end="00:59:36.220" style="s2">you&#39;d have to produce evidence of who</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.380" end="00:59:39.550" style="s2">you are which would be a document with</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.220" end="00:59:42.130" style="s2">your image on it the image of your face</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.550" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">that is in many ways the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.130" end="00:59:48.609" style="s2">who you are and people just don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:51.460" style="s2">want to believe this thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.609" end="00:59:54.910" style="s2">think their identity it&#39;s an insult to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.460" end="00:59:56.650" style="s2">your identity for this thing to be so</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.910" end="00:59:59.710" style="s2">malleable so</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.650" end="01:00:02.770" style="s2">changeable and in a way is not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.710" end="01:00:04.809" style="s2">not changeable it&#39;s that you and your</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.770" end="01:00:08.490" style="s2">parameters and posture and function</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.809" end="01:00:12.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not changeable your habits are</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.490" end="01:00:16.630" style="s2">less changeable than your form I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.670" end="01:00:19.059" style="s2">heard you say that people are resistant</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.630" end="01:00:21.069" style="s2">to the idea because if they are just</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.059" end="01:00:23.980" style="s2">simply stuck looking the way they are</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.069" end="01:00:26.619" style="s2">then it&#39;s not their fault but yeah if</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.980" end="01:00:29.470" style="s2">they could change it and don&#39;t then it</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.619" end="01:00:31.990" style="s2">is their fault and I have to say that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.470" end="01:00:34.059" style="s2">that resonates yeah but it&#39;s a double</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.990" end="01:00:38.470" style="s2">whammy isn&#39;t it the your face didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.059" end="01:00:41.410" style="s2">grow well and is your fault yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.470" end="01:00:44.140" style="s2">know shouldn&#39;t this change where we come</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.410" end="01:00:45.789" style="s2">to our children the fact is maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.140" end="01:00:48.520" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything about your face at</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.789" end="01:00:52.020" style="s2">some advanced age but this the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.520" end="01:00:54.819" style="s2">really difficult thing to think about is</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.020" end="01:00:58.450" style="s2">your children at the point that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.819" end="01:01:00.369" style="s2">born aren&#39;t damaged yet all you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.450" end="01:01:02.740" style="s2">do is not screw it up</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.369" end="01:01:05.049" style="s2">okay but a little caveat in that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.740" end="01:01:07.500" style="s2">surprised how many newborns I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.049" end="01:01:10.539" style="s2">that have that are correct</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.500" end="01:01:12.099" style="s2">to what degree at that well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.539" end="01:01:14.589" style="s2">fascinated about that I think that a</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.099" end="01:01:17.980" style="s2">couple of things first of all well the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.589" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">average woman giving birth is now</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.980" end="01:01:23.799" style="s2">considerably older you know yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.160" end="01:01:27.339" style="s2">I would be fascinated to talk to her a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.799" end="01:01:31.390" style="s2">proper someone who probably knew but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.339" end="01:01:35.349" style="s2">would imagine that in prehistoric so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.390" end="01:01:38.529" style="s2">in Paleolithic periods you would have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.349" end="01:01:41.099" style="s2">partner within a distance maybe six</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.529" end="01:01:43.480" style="s2">months a year after your first period</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.099" end="01:01:45.190" style="s2">III would have no idea but I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.480" end="01:01:47.710" style="s2">imagine this was a marker within the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.190" end="01:01:49.809" style="s2">cultural society but basically if a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.710" end="01:01:51.910" style="s2">of people were dead by the time they</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.809" end="01:01:54.970" style="s2">were thirty you have to get cracking at</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.910" end="01:01:56.890" style="s2">a much younger age although clearly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.970" end="01:01:58.599" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s an emotive comment to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.890" end="01:02:01.630" style="s2">suggest young girls should be having</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.599" end="01:02:05.170" style="s2">babies but certainly women are having</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.630" end="01:02:07.960" style="s2">babies older now that&#39;s certainly true</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.170" end="01:02:10.630" style="s2">and you&#39;re on the right track women</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.960" end="01:02:13.299" style="s2">would have matured later that</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.630" end="01:02:16.420" style="s2">his move to an earlier point in life</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.299" end="01:02:19.239" style="s2">because of the plentiful resources that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.420" end="01:02:21.630" style="s2">we have but you are on the right track</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.239" end="01:02:24.430" style="s2">most women would have had very few</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.630" end="01:02:27.809" style="s2">periods in life because they would have</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.430" end="01:02:29.979" style="s2">been in a state of amarant amenorrhea</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.809" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">for much of their lives are there</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.979" end="01:02:34.420" style="s2">because they were pregnant because they</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:36.460" style="s2">were lactating because they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.420" end="01:02:39.910" style="s2">enough resources to produce a baby and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.460" end="01:02:43.989" style="s2">so yes there would not have been long</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.910" end="01:02:47.489" style="s2">periods of fertility in which women were</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.989" end="01:02:50.380" style="s2">not engaged in some part of reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.489" end="01:02:51.910" style="s2">you know so family planning is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.380" end="01:02:53.859" style="s2">wonderful thing yes since that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:57.670" style="s2">liberate liberate swimmin from this but</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.859" end="01:02:59.589" style="s2">it it does have consequences like being</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.670" end="01:03:01.420" style="s2">able to put off childbearing till so</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.589" end="01:03:04.390" style="s2">late in life that your body may not be</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.420" end="01:03:07.359" style="s2">up to it in the same way but also in</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.390" end="01:03:09.430" style="s2">these people wouldn&#39;t be as fit well</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:11.109" style="s2">they all you know modern mothers are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.430" end="01:03:12.819" style="s2">going to be as fit as their</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.109" end="01:03:15.190" style="s2">hunter-gatherer ancestors because the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.819" end="01:03:17.859" style="s2">hunter-gatherer ancestors were younger</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.190" end="01:03:20.259" style="s2">and more active absolutely so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.859" end="01:03:23.589" style="s2">you know I would imagine that the in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.259" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">fetus the child is resting far further</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.589" end="01:03:30.039" style="s2">down in the pelvis because of that so</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.039" end="01:03:33.640" style="s2">that&#39;s my one then mothers aren&#39;t moving</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.039" end="01:03:37.239" style="s2">as much that&#39;s number two then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.640" end="01:03:39.549" style="s2">sitting which was you know I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.239" end="01:03:41.739" style="s2">people did set but he also squatted and</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.549" end="01:03:44.049" style="s2">they were on the move whereas you know a</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.739" end="01:03:47.769" style="s2">lot of working people now are sat in one</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.049" end="01:03:51.609" style="s2">position for long periods of the day so</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.769" end="01:03:53.769" style="s2">that would be number three and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.609" end="01:03:55.900" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get onto some of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.769" end="01:03:58.690" style="s2">modern diet effects and things like this</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.900" end="01:04:01.390" style="s2">that I&#39;m not as familiar with but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.690" end="01:04:07.180" style="s2">been trying to throw ideas to suggest</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.390" end="01:04:09.940" style="s2">why would we be having babies born that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.180" end="01:04:13.809" style="s2">how having really in a great form and</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.940" end="01:04:16.390" style="s2">great a situation a fight a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.809" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">situation so that&#39;s one can amend my</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.390" end="01:04:21.969" style="s2">point from before it may be true it may</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:24.250" style="s2">not be true that you can protect your</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.969" end="01:04:26.590" style="s2">children completely by just after</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.250" end="01:04:27.849" style="s2">they are born having them behave in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.590" end="01:04:30.270" style="s2">way that will not cause these problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.849" end="01:04:34.420" style="s2">but you could protect your grandchildren</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.270" end="01:04:35.950" style="s2">right if your children behavior will</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.420" end="01:04:38.800" style="s2">stay with children for second practice I</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.950" end="01:04:41.080" style="s2">think the 90% of the population</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.800" end="01:04:43.420" style="s2">we&#39;re spot on here and what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.080" end="01:04:46.599" style="s2">interested me is I often see people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.420" end="01:04:48.940" style="s2">are born with like fetal molding so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.599" end="01:04:50.380" style="s2">know you&#39;re molded as a fetus in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.940" end="01:04:53.140" style="s2">womb particularly if you&#39;ve got twins</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.380" end="01:04:56.740" style="s2">it&#39;s very common and spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.140" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">correct to a huge degree in the first</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.740" end="01:05:01.150" style="s2">three years so at the moment I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">making comments below three years old</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.150" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">I&#39;m just leaving it blank and I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:06.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:08.260" style="s2">sleeping position I&#39;m saying you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.490" end="01:05:11.440" style="s2">I&#39;m gathering information I&#39;m fascinated</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.260" end="01:05:14.320" style="s2">I&#39;d like to learn more I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.440" end="01:05:16.540" style="s2">open my big mouth till I&#39;ve got a few</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.320" end="01:05:19.060" style="s2">more facts and I&#39;m a bit more certain so</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.540" end="01:05:21.970" style="s2">now you&#39;re born distorted you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.060" end="01:05:23.859" style="s2">likely to correct if you have there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.970" end="01:05:26.920" style="s2">the right influences there is good</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.859" end="01:05:29.859" style="s2">evidence and I&#39;ve seen anecdotally some</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.920" end="01:05:32.950" style="s2">really nice improvements particularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.859" end="01:05:35.650" style="s2">with asymmetry mm-hmm from fetal</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.950" end="01:05:37.900" style="s2">moulding so but but you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.650" end="01:05:39.390" style="s2">lot of things you can do I mean I do are</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.900" end="01:05:43.060" style="s2">you familiar with the baby led weaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.390" end="01:05:45.700" style="s2">movement I don&#39;t think so okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.060" end="01:05:48.580" style="s2">baby led weaning movement is that pure</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.700" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2">Rayz came around during after the</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.580" end="01:05:51.849" style="s2">Industrial Revolution when women started</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:54.010" style="s2">going to work and course it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.849" end="01:05:57.220" style="s2">important we have equality and we engage</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.010" end="01:06:00.550" style="s2">the full labor force however all of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.220" end="01:06:02.890" style="s2">sudden women not being at home no</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.550" end="01:06:04.599" style="s2">mothering or or a nursing their mothers</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.890" end="01:06:09.040" style="s2">with breast feeding as we would think</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.599" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">what 24 36 months you know this is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.040" end="01:06:14.109" style="s2">sort of numbers of a thrown around if</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:16.150" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stop that early the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.109" end="01:06:18.700" style="s2">natural conclusion was you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.150" end="01:06:22.570" style="s2">give baby something soft that they can</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.700" end="01:06:26.080" style="s2">eat hmm and I think that&#39;s kind of where</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.570" end="01:06:28.599" style="s2">baby food came from but I think that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.080" end="01:06:30.130" style="s2">just I kind of think it&#39;s his assumption</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.599" end="01:06:32.560" style="s2">we all have the assumption that these</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.130" end="01:06:34.240" style="s2">poor little darlings are so delicate</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.560" end="01:06:36.099" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t survive you know they</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.240" end="01:06:37.850" style="s2">can&#39;t miss a meal they&#39;ve gotta have</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.099" end="01:06:40.490" style="s2">clockwork bedtime you</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.850" end="01:06:42.500" style="s2">what those humans they&#39;re pretty Hardy</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.490" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">animals they&#39;ve done rather well</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.500" end="01:06:49.430" style="s2">actually they&#39;re not that delicate um</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.640" end="01:06:52.010" style="s2">and so the idea was baby led weaning is</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.430" end="01:06:55.550" style="s2">you go directly from breastfeeding to</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.010" end="01:06:57.560" style="s2">solid food mm-hmm so you um you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.550" end="01:07:02.030" style="s2">this transition phase when you rely on</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.560" end="01:07:06.710" style="s2">breast milk for nutritional value while</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.030" end="01:07:10.220" style="s2">you start ramping up hard food and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.710" end="01:07:12.670" style="s2">start giving so if anyone&#39;s listening to</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.220" end="01:07:16.250" style="s2">this you know a good way to start it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.670" end="01:07:20.680" style="s2">you cut the veg that you&#39;re going to eat</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.250" end="01:07:25.070" style="s2">up into chunks one and a half times a</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.680" end="01:07:27.140" style="s2">baby&#39;s fist length so that a bit so if a</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.070" end="01:07:29.660" style="s2">baby picks it up a bit will stick out</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.140" end="01:07:32.390" style="s2">one side of the other side and they can</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.660" end="01:07:34.040" style="s2">nibble on it so you&#39;re not you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.390" end="01:07:36.410" style="s2">not and this is important to understand</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.040" end="01:07:38.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not expecting the baby to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.410" end="01:07:44.000" style="s2">their full nutritional value you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.990" end="01:07:46.130" style="s2">expecting baby to enjoy the food and it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.000" end="01:07:48.650" style="s2">should be the same types of food that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.130" end="01:07:52.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve got on your plate because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.650" end="01:07:56.030" style="s2">what the baby wants to do and baby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.580" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">gonna have fun with food you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.030" end="01:08:00.590" style="s2">use the breast meat for nutrition and</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:02.780" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna watch in the nappy that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.590" end="01:08:05.570" style="s2">might call diapers but the correct name</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.780" end="01:08:08.780" style="s2">is nappy and you&#39;re gonna look in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.570" end="01:08:11.930" style="s2">nappy to see what output is going on so</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.780" end="01:08:13.790" style="s2">that you can gauge how much of nutrition</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.930" end="01:08:15.860" style="s2">is now from milk I know how much is from</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.790" end="01:08:17.420" style="s2">solid foods and then you make a progress</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.860" end="01:08:23.240" style="s2">straight through to solid foods and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.420" end="01:08:25.580" style="s2">never give slops makes perfect sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.240" end="01:08:29.240" style="s2">it was a when we&#39;re a baby so when I</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.580" end="01:08:35.570" style="s2">looked at my nephew who was a classic</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.240" end="01:08:41.000" style="s2">example he had two big cheeks he would</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.570" end="01:08:43.550" style="s2">cry he would poo he would eat and sleep</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.000" end="01:08:46.970" style="s2">and that was it and when I watched him</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.550" end="01:08:49.790" style="s2">feeding these muscles the cheek muscles</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.970" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">what basically is they they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.790" end="01:08:53.660" style="s2">important and powerful muscles</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:57.560" style="s2">his body that&#39;s did everything getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.660" end="01:08:59.930" style="s2">food on board was his goal in life at</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.560" end="01:09:01.819" style="s2">the time and I was amazed with his box</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.930" end="01:09:05.540" style="s2">inators and they these big cheek muscles</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.819" end="01:09:08.750" style="s2">now babies and cherubs should have big</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.540" end="01:09:11.509" style="s2">cheeks anyone over the age of four</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.750" end="01:09:16.430" style="s2">should have hollow cheeks hmm</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.509" end="01:09:17.870" style="s2">and again I think that we accept this</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.430" end="01:09:21.890" style="s2">chubby cheeks and they&#39;re not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.870" end="01:09:25.219" style="s2">fat it&#39;s muscle because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.890" end="01:09:30.230" style="s2">have to do something it&#39;s unlikely you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.219" end="01:09:33.940" style="s2">will yeah we&#39;re lazy well so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.230" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">do that part right our ancestors were</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.940" end="01:09:39.140" style="s2">deprived of food almost all the time</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:44.420" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have enough yeah and because</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.140" end="01:09:48.130" style="s2">of that there is a strong desire to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.420" end="01:09:51.049" style="s2">limit the use of calories that can be</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.130" end="01:09:53.480" style="s2">preserved right because the calories</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.049" end="01:09:56.930" style="s2">saved is the equivalent of a calorie</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.480" end="01:09:59.420" style="s2">found so we are wired to do all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.930" end="01:10:00.770" style="s2">foolish things on the basis that we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.420" end="01:10:02.360" style="s2">preserving calories that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.770" end="01:10:02.860" style="s2">don&#39;t need and would be better off to</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.360" end="01:10:06.469" style="s2">burn</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.860" end="01:10:09.080" style="s2">that&#39;s over from evolution yeah yeah yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.469" end="01:10:11.480" style="s2">yeah absolutely true I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.080" end="01:10:16.940" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re programmed to be lazy in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.480" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">certain way so but an infant&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.940" end="01:10:22.610" style="s2">very different suckle and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:27.140" style="s2">different packing from an adult swallow</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.610" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have to make that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.140" end="01:10:33.290" style="s2">transition you probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:34.790" style="s2">I remember suckling in the days when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.290" end="01:10:38.989" style="s2">was still eating wheat I remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.790" end="01:10:42.260" style="s2">suckling a Big Mac it wasn&#39;t very pretty</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.989" end="01:10:43.850" style="s2">it was a bit messy but I managed it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.260" end="01:10:46.400" style="s2">I suck called the Big Mac I just you</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.850" end="01:10:48.199" style="s2">know used a suckling time action til</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.400" end="01:10:50.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve got the whole Big Mac in it took a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.199" end="01:10:53.420" style="s2">bit of fluid but you could do it and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.510" end="01:10:57.230" style="s2">think that most people still suckle you</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.420" end="01:10:59.090" style="s2">swallowing so use this musculature when</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.230" end="01:11:01.730" style="s2">they swallow and we&#39;ve never made the</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.090" end="01:11:03.650" style="s2">full transition so that&#39;s baby led</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.730" end="01:11:04.520" style="s2">weaning let me let me understand what</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.650" end="01:11:07.890" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.520" end="01:11:09.810" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that because we skipped</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.890" end="01:11:12.270" style="s2">this phase where babies should be</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.810" end="01:11:16.350" style="s2">learning how to deal with solid food</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.270" end="01:11:21.870" style="s2">yeah that we learn to eat solid food</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.350" end="01:11:23.790" style="s2">with the mechanical approach that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.870" end="01:11:25.620" style="s2">would take to a liquid food in other</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.790" end="01:11:30.210" style="s2">words when somebody purees the carrots</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.620" end="01:11:32.340" style="s2">they turn it into what we would eat as</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.210" end="01:11:34.770" style="s2">as we would breast milk the suckling</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.340" end="01:11:40.530" style="s2">reflux continues and it gets developed</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.770" end="01:11:43.230" style="s2">into a kind of what to say a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.530" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">chewing that is effective enough to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.230" end="01:11:50.310" style="s2">the food ground up and digestible but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:53.160" style="s2">does the wrong things to our faces yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.310" end="01:11:55.290" style="s2">so you know we&#39;re supposed to move from</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.160" end="01:11:58.710" style="s2">the infantile circle to an adult swallow</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.290" end="01:12:01.110" style="s2">and I think we get about 40 50 percent</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.710" end="01:12:02.910" style="s2">of the way there we modify when you need</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.110" end="01:12:06.500" style="s2">to bring the teeth into action usually</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.910" end="01:12:09.210" style="s2">but we&#39;re using our facial musculature</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.500" end="01:12:11.430" style="s2">mm-hmm so we&#39;re using the facial nerve</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.210" end="01:12:14.100" style="s2">not the trigeminal nerve that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.430" end="01:12:15.690" style="s2">get complex to in our swallowing process</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.100" end="01:12:17.489" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s causing deeper</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.690" end="01:12:19.140" style="s2">problems than we would otherwise imagine</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.489" end="01:12:21.660" style="s2">but particularly it&#39;s upsetting the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.140" end="01:12:23.700" style="s2">balance so when I do and I&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.660" end="01:12:25.890" style="s2">best sometimes I do a bad swallow I do a</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.700" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">little bit of yeah but if you do a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.890" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">proper swallow</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.630" end="01:12:37.200" style="s2">there should be nothing where&#39;s you see</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.760" end="01:12:41.820" style="s2">so many people doing this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.200" end="01:12:45.270" style="s2">now if you&#39;re sucking like that multiple</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.820" end="01:12:48.960" style="s2">times a day every day eventually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.270" end="01:12:53.070" style="s2">going to pull everything back and most</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.960" end="01:12:54.540" style="s2">people if you take a ruler and you line</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.070" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">it from the tip of the nose to the tip</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.540" end="01:13:01.050" style="s2">of the chin a huge number of people have</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.840" end="01:13:03.270" style="s2">sucked that whole segment back you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.050" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">sucking the teeth back what you wonder</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.270" end="01:13:07.290" style="s2">why you don&#39;t have enough space for the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:09.690" style="s2">teeth or your wisdom teeth then you suck</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.290" end="01:13:11.730" style="s2">your your the tongue space so the tongue</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.690" end="01:13:13.680" style="s2">now has to rest closer and closer to</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.730" end="01:13:15.350" style="s2">your airway and that that&#39;s just endemic</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.680" end="01:13:17.750" style="s2">when I walk down the high street again</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.350" end="01:13:19.520" style="s2">victim victim Vic</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.750" end="01:13:22.460" style="s2">and they&#39;re not even aware of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.520" end="01:13:24.680" style="s2">parents think it&#39;s like puree food it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.460" end="01:13:26.720" style="s2">the go-to you know when are you gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.680" end="01:13:27.530" style="s2">get pureed food you know when we had our</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.720" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">first child</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.530" end="01:13:37.570" style="s2">several people gave us some old bottles</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:41.720" style="s2">of organic puree food type IND good man</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.570" end="01:13:43.460" style="s2">alright so let me ask you a couple more</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.720" end="01:13:45.230" style="s2">questions don&#39;t mean unless you had</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.460" end="01:13:47.270" style="s2">something you wanted to well I was just</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.230" end="01:13:49.070" style="s2">gonna say that tipped a couple of other</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.270" end="01:13:52.340" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve noticed is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.070" end="01:13:55.940" style="s2">now got sugar and everything now if I</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.340" end="01:13:59.540" style="s2">want it you either put on weight you</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.940" end="01:14:01.370" style="s2">lose weight or you stay the same now if</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.540" end="01:14:03.230" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stay the same or the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.370" end="01:14:07.580" style="s2">trajectory and your percentiles as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.230" end="01:14:10.730" style="s2">growing child and you start you start</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.580" end="01:14:12.830" style="s2">having someone gives you a sugary snack</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.730" end="01:14:15.290" style="s2">so they give you your sugary snack you</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.830" end="01:14:22.090" style="s2">eat the sugary snack know you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.290" end="01:14:24.680" style="s2">eat less of other things so in the net</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.090" end="01:14:27.350" style="s2">effort you&#39;re gonna go to is now</p>

<p begin="01:16:15.159" end="01:16:20.800" style="s2">removed and we have had the idea sprung</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.919" end="01:16:25.119" style="s2">on us that he needs a permanent retainer</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.800" end="01:16:28.119" style="s2">in order to hold the teeth in place talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.119" end="01:16:29.739" style="s2">to me doctor might ah this is well the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.119" end="01:16:32.649" style="s2">ones I don&#39;t like talking about very</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.739" end="01:16:35.229" style="s2">much okay um so I get so many people</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.649" end="01:16:36.999" style="s2">from around the world saying um who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.229" end="01:16:39.130" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re doing and the answer</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.999" end="01:16:42.070" style="s2">really is no one&#39;s doing what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.130" end="01:16:46.599" style="s2">my father noticed these bond so my</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.070" end="01:16:53.260" style="s2">grandfather bought Western prices book</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.599" end="01:16:55.090" style="s2">on you know nutrition and whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.260" end="01:16:56.679" style="s2">was I can&#39;t remember but Weston Price</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.090" end="01:16:58.780" style="s2">had an interesting book he made some</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.679" end="01:17:01.929" style="s2">great observations my father can</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.780" end="01:17:04.510" style="s2">remember the place in the road where</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.929" end="01:17:06.639" style="s2">they were when my grandfather told him</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.510" end="01:17:09.760" style="s2">about the book and this was before my</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.639" end="01:17:11.769" style="s2">father had even finished school so my</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:13.780" style="s2">father knew about it and my grandfather</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.769" end="01:17:16.539" style="s2">did some little bits of orthodontics</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.780" end="01:17:18.519" style="s2">kind of based on this concept which my</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.539" end="01:17:20.289" style="s2">father was interested in and my father</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.519" end="01:17:22.269" style="s2">then he came up with this idea bought</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.289" end="01:17:24.070" style="s2">the tropics he came up the idea of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.269" end="01:17:25.659" style="s2">being a not a genetic it was an</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.070" end="01:17:28.679" style="s2">environmental condition and how you</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.659" end="01:17:31.959" style="s2">could affect it but remember back then</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.679" end="01:17:33.969" style="s2">people stood straighter people were</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.959" end="01:17:36.219" style="s2">educated to stand and sit better</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.969" end="01:17:38.649" style="s2">food was a bit tougher there was less</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.219" end="01:17:41.289" style="s2">refined carbohydrates so I inherited</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.649" end="01:17:44.350" style="s2">this system that was starting to</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.289" end="01:17:47.830" style="s2">struggle and to rule it you needed</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.350" end="01:17:50.470" style="s2">an incredible patient and you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.830" end="01:17:52.150" style="s2">an incredible orthodontist and when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.470" end="01:17:53.530" style="s2">committed to coming down here I thought</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.150" end="01:17:56.410" style="s2">right how can I make this simpler</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.530" end="01:17:58.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s not swinging you know you</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.410" end="01:18:01.180" style="s2">can&#39;t do this you can&#39;t expect everyone</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.570" end="01:18:03.760" style="s2">to become superhuman and of course you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.180" end="01:18:08.920" style="s2">don&#39;t make money if you need to see</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.760" end="01:18:12.310" style="s2">people that many times now that&#39;s I saw</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.920" end="01:18:14.230" style="s2">I now have I I&#39;m getting now I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.310" end="01:18:15.550" style="s2">have I&#39;ve made big big moves and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.230" end="01:18:18.070" style="s2">know might as I said my results are</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.550" end="01:18:19.750" style="s2">getting better a lot better but then how</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.070" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">can I apply this for other people around</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.750" end="01:18:22.540" style="s2">the world because people are constantly</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:25.960" style="s2">asking me might</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.540" end="01:18:27.550" style="s2">I live in bloody birdie birdie is there</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.960" end="01:18:29.050" style="s2">someone round me who can help I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.550" end="01:18:32.050" style="s2">looked on the orthotropic map there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.050" end="01:18:35.110" style="s2">this person I was it no one yet is doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.050" end="01:18:37.600" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing and I have literally</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.110" end="01:18:41.350" style="s2">risked everything I&#39;ve sold the house</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.600" end="01:18:43.990" style="s2">taken inheritance burnt the lot risking</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.350" end="01:18:45.850" style="s2">my life and skin but I can&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.990" end="01:18:48.070" style="s2">know why you do these things but you get</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.850" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">you get a passion you head off on his</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.070" end="01:18:56.970" style="s2">passion and I&#39;ve more or less got there</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:59.260" style="s2">however I&#39;m worried about everything I</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.970" end="01:19:01.360" style="s2">really worried I&#39;m really worried about</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.260" end="01:19:03.070" style="s2">all the people around the world now</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.360" end="01:19:05.410" style="s2">coming back ok the story of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.070" end="01:19:09.910" style="s2">preamble now let&#39;s come back to your</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.410" end="01:19:13.750" style="s2">child ok ok now the problem is that if</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.910" end="01:19:17.710" style="s2">you have the structure that was informed</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.750" end="01:19:20.500" style="s2">by your posture and function maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.710" end="01:19:22.990" style="s2">manipulated by orthodontic slightly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.500" end="01:19:25.150" style="s2">very hard to change your posture and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.990" end="01:19:27.070" style="s2">function in the structure that was</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.150" end="01:19:28.840" style="s2">informed by your posture and function</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.070" end="01:19:31.180" style="s2">because it&#39;s reminding you to have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.840" end="01:19:35.020" style="s2">same posture and function so reinforcing</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.180" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">self reinforcing so you what you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.020" end="01:19:39.250" style="s2">to do is get people to change their</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:43.030" style="s2">habits now one of the simplest things to</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.250" end="01:19:45.580" style="s2">do is chew gum I know it&#39;s not what it</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.030" end="01:19:49.000" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not fancy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.580" end="01:19:50.590" style="s2">attractive it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.000" end="01:19:53.350" style="s2">this wonderful treatment I can offer</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.590" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">people but chewing gum builds up the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.350" end="01:19:59.920" style="s2">muscle tone in time it works</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:02.050" style="s2">also of course trying to get your tongue</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.920" end="01:20:04.870" style="s2">up on the roof of the mouth and this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.050" end="01:20:07.330" style="s2">so I gave this lecture um and people</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.870" end="01:20:08.860" style="s2">started the mewing movement based on</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.330" end="01:20:13.180" style="s2">that lecture and the information I gave</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.860" end="01:20:17.830" style="s2">out it works but it takes a huge amount</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.180" end="01:20:21.370" style="s2">of personal commitment however your son</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.830" end="01:20:23.260" style="s2">now is been told they need permanent</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.370" end="01:20:26.890" style="s2">retention now let&#39;s think about its</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.260" end="01:20:31.810" style="s2">dissect those retainers for second so</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.890" end="01:20:34.050" style="s2">the teeth the bone and the gum rest in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.810" end="01:20:37.450" style="s2">balance between the lip and the tongue</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.050" end="01:20:41.140" style="s2">great well we know that that&#39;s system</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.450" end="01:20:43.150" style="s2">that we the most bill are the other five</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.140" end="01:20:45.730" style="s2">thousand four hundred species of mammals</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.150" end="01:20:49.710" style="s2">be using to get straight teeth as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.730" end="01:20:54.640" style="s2">ancestors used to do the same thing now</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.710" end="01:20:57.130" style="s2">if you need a retainer that retainer is</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.640" end="01:21:00.160" style="s2">going to hold the tooth out of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.130" end="01:21:03.520" style="s2">balance zone and you can do it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.160" end="01:21:07.390" style="s2">what a retainer does however you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.520" end="01:21:12.040" style="s2">hold the bone and the gum out of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.390" end="01:21:15.820" style="s2">balance zone hmm so in time what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.040" end="01:21:24.370" style="s2">to happen the teeth are going to be left</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.820" end="01:21:28.390" style="s2">without the bone and gum now that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.370" end="01:21:31.090" style="s2">going to be good and so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.390" end="01:21:34.090" style="s2">waiting over the years I was waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.090" end="01:21:36.220" style="s2">para dontist a gum expert and an</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.090" end="01:21:39.460" style="s2">endodontist someone who works with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.220" end="01:21:42.030" style="s2">roots of the teeth to contact me now</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.460" end="01:21:44.590" style="s2">about four years three years ago a</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.030" end="01:21:48.250" style="s2">periodontist contacted me saying I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.590" end="01:21:50.370" style="s2">believe that you know I&#39;m looking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.250" end="01:21:54.580" style="s2">doing surgery on people and they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.370" end="01:21:58.480" style="s2">damaged gums and bone all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.580" end="01:22:00.220" style="s2">I met a girl so I went and went for</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.480" end="01:22:02.020" style="s2">drinks after work and a friend came</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.220" end="01:22:04.810" style="s2">along and he bought his dental nurse</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.020" end="01:22:07.870" style="s2">with him and we&#39;re having chat and she</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.810" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">said that she was doing weekend work</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.870" end="01:22:13.420" style="s2">with a forensic dentist and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:16.540" style="s2">dentist is getting to look in places</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.420" end="01:22:18.850" style="s2">where most people don&#39;t so this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.540" end="01:22:21.130" style="s2">someone who identifies dead bodies and</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.850" end="01:22:24.040" style="s2">we frequently identify dead bodies if</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.130" end="01:22:26.170" style="s2">you don&#39;t know by looking at their teeth</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.040" end="01:22:28.930" style="s2">because clearly your teeth is a really</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.170" end="01:22:30.970" style="s2">with someone&#39;s very badly decayed teeth</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.930" end="01:22:33.040" style="s2">is a really good way to identify someone</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.970" end="01:22:34.480" style="s2">and he is looking at these dead bodies</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.040" end="01:22:36.700" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s gonna be a selection</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.480" end="01:22:37.840" style="s2">of people you know of different ages you</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.700" end="01:22:42.130" style="s2">know you&#39;re going to get lots of young</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.840" end="01:22:44.350" style="s2">teenagers as it happens and he&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.130" end="01:22:47.740" style="s2">looking and he said it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.350" end="01:22:51.700" style="s2">these skulls a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.740" end="01:22:55.420" style="s2">species than the skulls I did my medical</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.700" end="01:22:57.220" style="s2">training on and he&#39;s seeing what we</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.420" end="01:22:59.080" style="s2">refer to as the essence and</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.220" end="01:23:03.070" style="s2">fenestrations that&#39;s where the root is</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.080" end="01:23:03.550" style="s2">bulging out of the bone all over the</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.070" end="01:23:08.410" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.550" end="01:23:10.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s from holding the teeth out of</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.410" end="01:23:11.680" style="s2">their balancer and of course lots of</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.150" end="01:23:13.450" style="s2">parents will go to their orthodontist</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.680" end="01:23:16.150" style="s2">they&#39;ll say I don&#39;t want you to take</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.450" end="01:23:17.890" style="s2">teeth out so you&#39;re on John said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.150" end="01:23:19.990" style="s2">fine we&#39;ve got lots of methods so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.890" end="01:23:23.200" style="s2">don&#39;t take teeth out and though widen</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.990" end="01:23:25.120" style="s2">the dental arches and they&#39;ll take them</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.200" end="01:23:27.040" style="s2">out of the balance home and then you</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.120" end="01:23:28.990" style="s2">have a retainer that holds them out the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.040" end="01:23:30.820" style="s2">balance zone now I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.990" end="01:23:33.310" style="s2">criticize people not taking teeth out</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.820" end="01:23:37.600" style="s2">because I believe in not taking teeth</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.310" end="01:23:39.580" style="s2">out but if you going to expand and move</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:43.380" style="s2">someone&#39;s teeth out the balance zone</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.580" end="01:23:47.050" style="s2">you&#39;d better get that person to change</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.380" end="01:23:50.800" style="s2">so better change that balance and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.050" end="01:23:53.440" style="s2">the thing the child in question I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.800" end="01:23:56.020" style="s2">become very attached to him it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.440" end="01:23:58.330" style="s2">like I can just go get another so what</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.020" end="01:24:00.550" style="s2">can I do for him what what what should I</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.330" end="01:24:03.340" style="s2">say to this orthodontist and then what</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.550" end="01:24:05.230" style="s2">should I say to this kid and if I need</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.340" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">to make him change his behavior in order</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.230" end="01:24:17.290" style="s2">to rescue his denturri I&#39;m gonna do it</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:19.660" style="s2">um it&#39;s just I mean okay stop in change</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.290" end="01:24:24.640" style="s2">the easiest thing to change is your</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.660" end="01:24:27.130" style="s2">function okay I could if I go that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.640" end="01:24:29.530" style="s2">I can pick up my gym bag I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.130" end="01:24:31.660" style="s2">one I can go to gym I&#39;m not a member</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.530" end="01:24:33.700" style="s2">however in theory I could do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.660" end="01:24:37.480" style="s2">would program myself to go and do some</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.700" end="01:24:39.580" style="s2">function yeah so example I will ride my</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.480" end="01:24:41.680" style="s2">bike home because if I&#39;m first to take</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.580" end="01:24:42.820" style="s2">the bike home I force myself to do a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.680" end="01:24:44.700" style="s2">function all right</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.820" end="01:24:50.020" style="s2">functions you can force yourself to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.700" end="01:24:52.060" style="s2">posture is you it is very hard to change</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.020" end="01:24:55.210" style="s2">your posture now you&#39;ve got to change</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.060" end="01:24:58.720" style="s2">posture and function so what I do here</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.210" end="01:25:02.140" style="s2">in the clinic is i widen people&#39;s jaws</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.720" end="01:25:04.660" style="s2">so I gain structural change to help them</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.140" end="01:25:07.120" style="s2">to change and then I put in feedback</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.660" end="01:25:09.790" style="s2">mechanisms simple Pavlovian feedback</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.120" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">mechanism if you drop your mouth open it</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.790" end="01:25:16.330" style="s2">hurts now pretty soon you start to</p>

<p begin="01:28:21.760" end="01:28:27.070" style="s2">upper one they want to do removable</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.280" end="01:28:29.800" style="s2">which I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t even use well</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.070" end="01:28:35.230" style="s2">okay get the lower fixed because that</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.800" end="01:28:38.230" style="s2">will keep the aesthetic gain long enough</p>

<p begin="01:30:43.000" end="01:30:44.800" style="s2">just need a deeper level change than</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.469" end="01:30:47.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.800" end="01:30:50.260" style="s2">right but in the case of my older son</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.440" end="01:30:52.660" style="s2">I&#39;m in an even better position because I</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.260" end="01:30:55.500" style="s2">can tell him he needs to do this and if</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.660" end="01:30:59.280" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t do it I&#39;m getting embraces</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.500" end="01:31:04.420" style="s2">you see what I&#39;m saying yeah incentive</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.280" end="01:31:05.320" style="s2">yeah I mean you can&#39;t I mean there are</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.420" end="01:31:08.020" style="s2">other system</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.320" end="01:31:10.000" style="s2">that are simple um you know there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.020" end="01:31:12.460" style="s2">different systems that will simply widen</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.000" end="01:31:16.060" style="s2">the dental arches give a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.460" end="01:31:18.700" style="s2">tongue space that can help you to change</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.060" end="01:31:20.700" style="s2">one of the big so we make certain</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.700" end="01:31:24.310" style="s2">compensations</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.700" end="01:31:26.050" style="s2">so once we&#39;ve reduced tongue space we</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.310" end="01:31:29.020" style="s2">make a range of different places where</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.050" end="01:31:31.390" style="s2">we place our tongue up and that gives us</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.020" end="01:31:34.720" style="s2">a types of crooked teeth so when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.390" end="01:31:36.640" style="s2">about a class 1 class 2 class 3 or deep</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.720" end="01:31:39.910" style="s2">bites these various different things our</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.640" end="01:31:43.570" style="s2">orthodontist talked about I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.910" end="01:31:47.350" style="s2">that&#39;s not genetic it&#39;s more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.570" end="01:31:50.490" style="s2">be comfortable a range of comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.350" end="01:31:53.290" style="s2">places where you can place your tongue</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.490" end="01:31:56.130" style="s2">after you have a reduction of tongue</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.290" end="01:32:00.160" style="s2">space now there may be some genetic</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.130" end="01:32:03.130" style="s2">tendencies in how you respond to this</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.160" end="01:32:05.050" style="s2">problem which of course if you do your</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.130" end="01:32:09.340" style="s2">numbers you&#39;ll start seeing genetic</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.050" end="01:32:12.760" style="s2">shadows the other thing is you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.340" end="01:32:15.310" style="s2">forward head posture so now if you bring</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.760" end="01:32:17.110" style="s2">your teeth together force the tongue in</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.310" end="01:32:18.940" style="s2">the roof of the mouth you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.110" end="01:32:21.600" style="s2">compensation or you&#39;re unwinding a</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.940" end="01:32:24.670" style="s2">compensation if you put your chin back</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.600" end="01:32:26.470" style="s2">you know you&#39;re unwinding a compensation</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.670" end="01:32:29.740" style="s2">well of course it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.470" end="01:32:31.720" style="s2">uncomfortable to maintain this because</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.740" end="01:32:34.270" style="s2">now your tongue is bolting back into</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.720" end="01:32:37.120" style="s2">your airway that&#39;s why you made those</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.270" end="01:32:41.520" style="s2">compensations in the first place well</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.120" end="01:32:43.750" style="s2">you are not going to sit in discomfort</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.520" end="01:32:49.150" style="s2">particularly discomfort that affects</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.750" end="01:32:55.860" style="s2">your airway us do that so widening the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.150" end="01:32:59.590" style="s2">2/3 is reconstructing an ancestral state</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.860" end="01:33:02.170" style="s2">in one dimension in a simple singular</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.590" end="01:33:06.130" style="s2">dimension it&#39;s just helping to create</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.170" end="01:33:09.250" style="s2">more tongue space so that you can unwind</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.130" end="01:33:14.530" style="s2">those compensations comfortably without</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.250" end="01:33:17.620" style="s2">this huge desire to return ok so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.530" end="01:33:18.820" style="s2">not arguing against all appliances your</p>

<p begin="01:33:24.099" end="01:33:28.690" style="s2">ancestral condition yeah you just need</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.230" end="01:33:31.360" style="s2">to think to work out what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.690" end="01:33:33.340" style="s2">and why before you blindly just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.360" end="01:33:35.650" style="s2">wrap braces around everyone you know as</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.340" end="01:33:40.630" style="s2">a zealot you&#39;re disappointing me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.650" end="01:33:42.909" style="s2">sounds very moderate well what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.630" end="01:33:44.530" style="s2">like what I really think is a problem is</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.909" end="01:33:47.710" style="s2">when you have braces on the top jaw</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.530" end="01:33:50.650" style="s2">braces in the bottom jaw in whatever</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.710" end="01:33:54.610" style="s2">types of braces the preventing the teeth</p>

<p begin="01:33:58.389" end="01:34:03.460" style="s2">got a negative feedback - biting hard I</p>

<p begin="01:36:20.500" end="01:36:24.010" style="s2">feedback yeah you&#39;re just not using the</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.020" end="01:36:26.740" style="s2">muscles yep</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.010" end="01:36:29.020" style="s2">and of course half of the cause of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.740" end="01:36:32.620" style="s2">problem in the first place is you</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.020" end="01:36:35.470" style="s2">weren&#39;t using the muscles and so many</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.620" end="01:36:37.630" style="s2">times when we&#39;re focused on trying to</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.470" end="01:36:40.200" style="s2">arrange the as we say we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.630" end="01:36:42.700" style="s2">rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.200" end="01:36:47.830" style="s2">you know everyone gets a nice view of</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.700" end="01:36:49.690" style="s2">the band but mmm it&#39;s the fifth movie so</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.830" end="01:36:51.790" style="s2">you rearrange the teeth and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.690" end="01:36:54.460" style="s2">focused on this and you you you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.790" end="01:36:57.460" style="s2">not through you know if a patient comes</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.460" end="01:36:59.740" style="s2">to me halfway through orthodontic</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.460" end="01:37:01.510" style="s2">treatment one of the things I will</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.740" end="01:37:03.340" style="s2">always do is feel that the biting</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.510" end="01:37:04.360" style="s2">muscles you know and I&#39;ve got to tell</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.340" end="01:37:08.470" style="s2">you if you&#39;ve got a child in</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.360" end="01:37:11.350" style="s2">orthodontics now try it put your fingers</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.470" end="01:37:13.870" style="s2">on the biting muscles like there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.350" end="01:37:18.640" style="s2">fingers horizontally on the occlusal</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.870" end="01:37:22.000" style="s2">plane bite hard together and see how</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.640" end="01:37:24.220" style="s2">much of that muscle is activated and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.000" end="01:37:26.950" style="s2">frequently find that half the muscle</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.220" end="01:37:28.930" style="s2">won&#39;t activate there you can feel the</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.950" end="01:37:31.510" style="s2">muscle mass but it won&#39;t fire off</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.930" end="01:37:36.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s being inhibited because the</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.510" end="01:37:36.030" style="s2">teeth don&#39;t meet together comfortably</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.380" end="01:37:46.269" style="s2">all right well I&#39;m getting the picture</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.010" end="01:37:50.019" style="s2">so I have a last question for you</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.269" end="01:37:56.369" style="s2">I understood you to say in one of your</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.019" end="01:38:03.099" style="s2">talks that your license is jeopardized</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.369" end="01:38:05.380" style="s2">tell me about this okay so it was I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.099" end="01:38:07.480" style="s2">putting up informational videos on</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.380" end="01:38:11.219" style="s2">YouTube you know people were asking me</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.480" end="01:38:14.559" style="s2">and I was putting the videos up and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.219" end="01:38:18.880" style="s2">was giving my opinions and it was</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.559" end="01:38:21.579" style="s2">becoming very very popular and it is now</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.880" end="01:38:23.320" style="s2">very as I said I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.579" end="01:38:25.769" style="s2">orthodontists get stopped on the streets</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.320" end="01:38:30.730" style="s2">but I get soft on the streets a fair bit</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.769" end="01:38:32.949" style="s2">so this was upsetting the status quo so</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.730" end="01:38:34.929" style="s2">the British orthodontic society have</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.949" end="01:38:36.639" style="s2">referred me that they&#39;re their club</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.929" end="01:38:37.929" style="s2">they&#39;re a club you know they&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.639" end="01:38:41.019" style="s2">third antic club they&#39;re they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.929" end="01:38:45.969" style="s2">important they have now thrown me out</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.019" end="01:38:50.099" style="s2">and they&#39;ve also referred me to my my</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.969" end="01:38:52.809" style="s2">official body the general Dental Council</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.099" end="01:39:00.190" style="s2">on a number of these videos and of</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.809" end="01:39:02.920" style="s2">course of course it&#39;s a problem here</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.190" end="01:39:04.570" style="s2">because I&#39;m going to be when you go to</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.920" end="01:39:07.389" style="s2">court when you go to general dental</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.570" end="01:39:11.860" style="s2">council it&#39;s like a court and so I have</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.389" end="01:39:16.210" style="s2">a expert who&#39;s in prosecution and I have</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.860" end="01:39:18.489" style="s2">an expert who&#39;s in defense who&#39;s armed</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.210" end="01:39:21.190" style="s2">so you have a prosecution defense expert</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.489" end="01:39:23.949" style="s2">well the prosecuting expert is an</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.190" end="01:39:26.820" style="s2">orthodontist who&#39;s very very certain I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.949" end="01:39:29.920" style="s2">very very guilty and a very bad man and</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.820" end="01:39:31.659" style="s2">the defense expert will clearly he is an</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.920" end="01:39:34.150" style="s2">orthodontist because you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.659" end="01:39:37.989" style="s2">other dopest experts and he thinks I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.150" end="01:39:41.489" style="s2">pretty bad and I probably am doing all</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.989" end="01:39:44.199" style="s2">the wrong things as well so you know and</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.489" end="01:39:47.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange and interesting situation</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.199" end="01:39:50.199" style="s2">um I also have two clinical cases one is</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.980" end="01:39:52.420" style="s2">a mother that thinks it was he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.199" end="01:39:54.639" style="s2">what I&#39;ve done is incredibly good for</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.420" end="01:39:56.949" style="s2">her child she&#39;s absolutely singing my</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.639" end="01:39:59.739" style="s2">praises and they&#39;re taking me to court</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.949" end="01:40:01.960" style="s2">over it I mean it&#39;s a bit strange I know</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.739" end="01:40:05.110" style="s2">one is a child I didn&#39;t actually treat I</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.960" end="01:40:08.130" style="s2">set her up for someone else to treat so</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.110" end="01:40:10.719" style="s2">they&#39;re having a go at me about the the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.130" end="01:40:12.219" style="s2">objectives of what I wanted to do so</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.719" end="01:40:14.739" style="s2">it&#39;s not about whether I did the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.219" end="01:40:17.170" style="s2">treatment right or wrong it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.739" end="01:40:18.280" style="s2">the the philosophy so what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.170" end="01:40:22.050" style="s2">trying to do here is they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.280" end="01:40:24.850" style="s2">get me on that I&#39;m doing the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.050" end="01:40:27.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.850" end="01:40:32.860" style="s2">rattling on three years now sort of when</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.580" end="01:40:36.730" style="s2">the first thing started going and I you</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.860" end="01:40:42.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s silly how much of my</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.730" end="01:40:44.920" style="s2">time energy this takes it just it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.280" end="01:40:48.310" style="s2">it&#39;s silliness it&#39;s craziness I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.920" end="01:40:50.620" style="s2">know you were talking as if no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.310" end="01:40:54.940" style="s2">the cause of this is and yet both</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.620" end="01:40:57.820" style="s2">experts are throwing in comments that I</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.940" end="01:41:00.370" style="s2">mean really strong wording you know like</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.820" end="01:41:04.480" style="s2">I know this is wrong it&#39;s been proven</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.370" end="01:41:08.050" style="s2">it&#39;s set and I yeah I will have to see</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.480" end="01:41:10.180" style="s2">how this goes but it&#39;s um I hope I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.050" end="01:41:13.000" style="s2">get a fair shout I hope I get a chance</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.180" end="01:41:16.210" style="s2">to say what I think what happens if they</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.000" end="01:41:19.570" style="s2">rule against you bye bye</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.210" end="01:41:21.280" style="s2">really mmm I can&#39;t practice anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.570" end="01:41:24.790" style="s2">of course what the annoying thing is I</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.280" end="01:41:27.610" style="s2">having just you know invested everything</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.790" end="01:41:30.010" style="s2">that I have into a treatment method and</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.610" end="01:41:34.180" style="s2">making it better I would lose all of</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.010" end="01:41:37.630" style="s2">that so here&#39;s the thing Mike that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.180" end="01:41:39.820" style="s2">happen and what&#39;s more I have listened</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.630" end="01:41:43.540" style="s2">very carefully to what you&#39;ve put online</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.820" end="01:41:46.330" style="s2">and I was expecting to hear kind of</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.540" end="01:41:47.980" style="s2">cruddy evolutionary analysis I expected</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.330" end="01:41:50.710" style="s2">based on what you were saying that you</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.980" end="01:41:52.480" style="s2">would be right but a lot of what you</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.710" end="01:41:55.210" style="s2">were gonna say was gonna need cleaning</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.480" end="01:41:56.980" style="s2">up that&#39;s not what I heard I heard</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.210" end="01:42:00.670" style="s2">somebody who nailed the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.980" end="01:42:02.650" style="s2">analysis thank you very much so in some</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.670" end="01:42:05.170" style="s2">sense I think you need a witness on your</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.650" end="01:42:10.270" style="s2">behalf who&#39;s capable of saying that</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.170" end="01:42:12.550" style="s2">credibly because like it or not they are</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.270" end="01:42:13.840" style="s2">engaged in malpractice if they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.550" end="01:42:15.489" style="s2">after you not only are they</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.840" end="01:42:17.770" style="s2">wasting your time but they are</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.489" end="01:42:20.730" style="s2">threatening to harm your patients if you</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.770" end="01:42:25.659" style="s2">can&#39;t work on them yeah that has been</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.730" end="01:42:27.070" style="s2">that is a suggested argument by one of</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.659" end="01:42:31.570" style="s2">my patients who&#39;s saying you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.070" end="01:42:33.400" style="s2">take away my right and my choice to have</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.570" end="01:42:37.780" style="s2">what you&#39;re providing Mike if they</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.400" end="01:42:40.510" style="s2">stopped you from working and if you have</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.780" end="01:42:42.550" style="s2">you contacted you said you had some</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.510" end="01:42:45.550" style="s2">contact with evolutionary medicine do</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.550" end="01:42:47.920" style="s2">you know Randy Nessie I&#39;ve heard of him</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.550" end="01:42:49.840" style="s2">but he&#39;s slightly I&#39;m slightly down the</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.920" end="01:42:52.330" style="s2">food chain should we put it from</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.840" end="01:42:54.849" style="s2">Randolph Nessie well I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.330" end="01:42:56.889" style="s2">that I know Randy he was a mentor of</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.849" end="01:42:58.780" style="s2">mine when I was in grad school I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.889" end="01:43:00.909" style="s2">he would find this fascinating and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.780" end="01:43:04.000" style="s2">almost sure he&#39;ll end up seeing it so</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.909" end="01:43:07.780" style="s2">Randy I&#39;d be very curious what you hear</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.000" end="01:43:11.139" style="s2">in this discussion and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.780" end="01:43:13.989" style="s2">about time that evolutionary dentistry</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.139" end="01:43:18.760" style="s2">was born and you seem like the right guy</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.989" end="01:43:23.440" style="s2">to Harold in that era thank you very</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.760" end="01:43:26.080" style="s2">much I do think as as I have mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.440" end="01:43:30.099" style="s2">before I think that evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.080" end="01:43:32.590" style="s2">medicine is woefully and I mean woefully</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.099" end="01:43:34.869" style="s2">under recognized yeah I said so ago</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.590" end="01:43:37.690" style="s2">slight slight detour for a second I</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.869" end="01:43:40.929" style="s2">think that if I was run over by a bus</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.690" end="01:43:43.840" style="s2">tomorrow I would want modern acute</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.929" end="01:43:46.270" style="s2">medicine on my side if there is no</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.840" end="01:43:49.360" style="s2">shadow of a doubt that it&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.270" end="01:43:54.070" style="s2">yeah however if I have a chronic illness</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.360" end="01:43:57.150" style="s2">I think we could almost say by</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.070" end="01:44:00.159" style="s2">definition that modern medicines failed</p>
