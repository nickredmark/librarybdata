<p begin="00:02:16.520" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">the philosophical heritage given to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.319" end="00:02:26.660" style="s2">by people like Socrates and Plato and</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.660" end="00:02:34.050" style="s2">we then took a look at the theory of</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.050" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">in the psychology the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">of wisdom and we took a look at his</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">theory and I pointed out his ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">adopting shaping and selecting are</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">order to bring understanding in that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">sort of intuitive grasping of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">significance of information I think is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:08.489" style="s2">what he&#39;s implying and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">the how he involves a balancing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.489" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2">interests and there&#39;s the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">how you connected to yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.110" end="00:03:16.050" style="s2">interpersonal how you connected to other</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">and so that&#39;s at least important</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.370" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">connections to implicitly at least I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">mean important connections to meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.530" end="00:03:29.820" style="s2">life that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">throughout this course he invokes</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.820" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">balance throughout and I tried to make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:34.980" style="s2">good case that you should see that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:38.100" style="s2">optimization and directly relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.980" end="00:03:39.600" style="s2">therefore two accounts of optimization</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.100" end="00:03:44.090" style="s2">of processing that we discussed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.600" end="00:03:44.090" style="s2">connection to relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.269" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">there were some issues I had with</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:52.110" style="s2">Sternberg the idea that all wise people</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:54.420" style="s2">all of this machinery is directed</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.110" end="00:03:58.430" style="s2">towards the common good that strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.420" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">as an Akron estate I think a less</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">contentious claim would be that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">directed towards virtue and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">life for oneself and others in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">unspecified way there was also the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">invocation of values as affecting or</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">constraining the whole process again it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">was unclear to me what this is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:24.210" style="s2">an ambiguity here it could be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:26.970" style="s2">relatively trivial claim that the wise</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.210" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">person is being regulated by normativity</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.970" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">you know by considerations what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">and good and beautiful and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:35.750" style="s2">definitional because wisdom is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">normative term</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.750" end="00:04:40.100" style="s2">and therefore relatively trivial or it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">could be that specific values are being</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.100" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">invoked here but if that&#39;s the case they</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">should be specifically stated and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">justified for why those ones are chosen</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">and explicitly explain how those</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:53.210" style="s2">specific values make an impact on</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:56.540" style="s2">specific aspects of the machinery so</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.210" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">that&#39;s all sort of missing and needs to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.540" end="00:05:00.230" style="s2">be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:01.160" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately a product theory not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.230" end="00:05:02.540" style="s2">process theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.160" end="00:05:03.920" style="s2">Sternberg does have a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.540" end="00:05:05.420" style="s2">foolishness but it&#39;s not independently</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.920" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">generated and it doesn&#39;t really pick up</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.420" end="00:05:12.740" style="s2">on the centrality of seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:16.220" style="s2">illusion and into reality so if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.740" end="00:05:17.480" style="s2">allow me to make use of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.220" end="00:05:19.790" style="s2">machinery not only the machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.480" end="00:05:21.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about in the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.790" end="00:05:23.750" style="s2">wisdom but the machinery that many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.800" end="00:05:25.400" style="s2">these theorists are either explicitly or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.750" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">implicitly invoking all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.400" end="00:05:30.290" style="s2">philosophical work we already covered in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.730" end="00:05:33.169" style="s2">the first half of the course connected</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.290" end="00:05:39.080" style="s2">to wisdom I want to try and humbly draw</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.169" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">upon that and talk about proposal made</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.080" end="00:05:45.140" style="s2">by myself and Leo Ferraro if you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:47.330" style="s2">remember Leo and I have done work</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.140" end="00:05:49.790" style="s2">together on flow which I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.330" end="00:05:55.790" style="s2">work on mindfulness that I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.790" end="00:05:58.100" style="s2">about this is worth from 2013 so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.790" end="00:06:01.760" style="s2">place to start is to go back to what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.100" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">saw and what a argued for so I hope I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.760" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">don&#39;t have to recapitulate that whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:07.370" style="s2">argument right that we have these two</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">competencies we have sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.370" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">inferential competence that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">with our propositional knowing and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:21.200" style="s2">have an insight competence right over</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:23.300" style="s2">here and that has to do with control and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.200" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">that has to be that&#39;s more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.300" end="00:06:27.260" style="s2">procedural perspectival I&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">to that point because that&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.260" end="00:06:33.640" style="s2">criticisms of Verve achey and Ferraro</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:36.640" style="s2">and then the idea here is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.640" end="00:06:36.640" style="s2">enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.350" end="00:06:43.900" style="s2">and protected from undue influence from</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.200" end="00:06:46.930" style="s2">sort of more s1 processing by active</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.900" end="00:06:49.990" style="s2">open-mindedness and then I argued and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.930" end="00:06:52.060" style="s2">following Jacobs and Teasdale right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.990" end="00:06:54.100" style="s2">also arguments derived from being the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.060" end="00:06:56.740" style="s2">need for an independent competence on</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.100" end="00:06:58.870" style="s2">controlled etc right that while this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.740" end="00:07:01.510" style="s2">really clearly the case for theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.870" end="00:07:03.340" style="s2">context and more therapeutic or at least</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.340" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">contexts we want this to be foreground 8</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.280" end="00:07:10.780" style="s2">and we want it protected from that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:13.000" style="s2">so we want it developed by mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.780" end="00:07:14.890" style="s2">really and you understand that by</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.000" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">mindfulness I mean a style that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.890" end="00:07:21.040" style="s2">coordinates psycho technologies together</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">of meditation contemplation perhaps flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.040" end="00:07:28.320" style="s2">interaction with the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.370" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">brought up the immediate question of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:35.350" style="s2">okay how are these coordinated together</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:36.910" style="s2">now one answer might be that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.350" end="00:07:38.920" style="s2">just opponent processing and there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.910" end="00:07:43.020" style="s2">self-organizing and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.920" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">potentially viable but there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.020" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">already at this point sorry that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:49.410" style="s2">so self congratulatory I don&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:53.380" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.410" end="00:07:55.870" style="s2">okay we argued let&#39;s just state it that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.380" end="00:07:59.950" style="s2">way we argued that whereas this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.870" end="00:08:03.460" style="s2">giving priority to propositional</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.950" end="00:08:05.650" style="s2">knowledge this has to do with procedural</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.460" end="00:08:07.810" style="s2">knowledge skills of attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.650" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">basically with cultivating certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.810" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">skills of attention and then the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:14.920" style="s2">was that active open mindedness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:18.630" style="s2">propositional knowing basically we</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.920" end="00:08:21.370" style="s2">argued then give you knowledge of facts</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.630" end="00:08:27.910" style="s2">this this gives you knowledge of events</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:30.490" style="s2">right or processes so right this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.910" end="00:08:33.010" style="s2">basically tells you about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.490" end="00:08:36.160" style="s2">understanding what a fact is as cross</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.010" end="00:08:38.169" style="s2">contextual patterns events or processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.160" end="00:08:40.270" style="s2">are things that are unfolding like</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.169" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">idiosyncratically right in time and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.270" end="00:08:46.600" style="s2">space I&#39;m not I mean I that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.100" style="s2">right perhaps a better way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.600" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">this that would align it with the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:53.970" style="s2">we talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">it&#39;s worked and sharp is this is your</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.970" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2">grasping of principles and this is your</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:09:02.940" style="s2">grasping of processes and this would</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:06.810" style="s2">therefore largely be sort of like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.940" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">being talked about in Sofia and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.810" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">largely what perhaps what was being</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">talked about in phronesis we suggested</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:16.170" style="s2">that I&#39;m still open to that suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite sure that it Maps as</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.170" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">cleanly as that now but in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2">this clearly propositional and at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">centrally procedural we invoked</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:41.310" style="s2">prospective oh right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:46.190" style="s2">propositional this is largely procedural</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">and then this is perspectival and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.190" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">right so if this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:52.230" style="s2">inference this has to do with insight</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already got a good sense we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.230" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">seen this we didn&#39;t we were not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:09:58.110" style="s2">cuz it hadn&#39;t been generated we are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">aware of Grossman&#39;s work at the time but</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.110" end="00:10:02.490" style="s2">we knew the Berlin work and this is of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:08.250" style="s2">court what&#39;s being managed here is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.490" end="00:10:10.110" style="s2">internalization how do you learn to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.250" end="00:10:12.660" style="s2">adopt and take other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.110" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">perspectives and internalize them within</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.660" end="00:10:18.390" style="s2">your own processing so they become</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">metacognitively effective and then we we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2">said well what perspectival knowing did</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:28.140" style="s2">and here&#39;s where I want to launch or</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">what am I I think first criticisms we</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.140" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">said well what perspective knowing does</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:36.750" style="s2">is it integrates knowledge of facts with</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">knowledge of events it sort of helps you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.750" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">to use I think maybe a better language</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:45.720" style="s2">it helps you to put principles into</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.020" style="s2">process and have processes governed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.720" end="00:10:51.209" style="s2">principles and that&#39;s what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.020" end="00:10:53.160" style="s2">perspectives are doing so this is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.209" end="00:10:55.380" style="s2">talking about the the epitome of this as</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.160" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">a skill and the epitome of this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.380" end="00:11:00.270" style="s2">theory and what a perspective does is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:02.700" style="s2">put theories and skills together I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.270" end="00:11:03.270" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of right still in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.700" end="00:11:05.310" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.270" end="00:11:08.310" style="s2">I think the relationship is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.310" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">a what I would argue for here the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.310" end="00:11:17.160" style="s2">relationship is more like this the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">propositional knowledge is grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.160" end="00:11:24.080" style="s2">but affected by procedural knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:27.450" style="s2">your skills knowing how to interact and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.080" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">then that this your your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.450" end="00:11:32.010" style="s2">cultivate skills and then apply them to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">the propositional knowledge is grounded</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.010" end="00:11:38.010" style="s2">in your perspectival knowing because</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">that&#39;s going to give you your</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.010" end="00:11:42.779" style="s2">situational awareness that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">cultivate the skills and so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.779" end="00:11:48.839" style="s2">apply your knowledge of principles and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">then I would argue that that and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.839" end="00:11:51.390" style="s2">seen me make this argument before this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:54.270" style="s2">is ultimately grounded in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.390" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">participatory knowing the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.270" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">attunement that affords your being in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.260" style="s2">the world and your ability to go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:07.380" style="s2">modal transformation existential change</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.260" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">so that also brings up I might as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.380" end="00:12:12.839" style="s2">mention it now another criticism of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:14.339" style="s2">of this theory which is although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.839" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">talking about propositional and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.339" end="00:12:18.890" style="s2">procedural knowledge and prospective</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:21.270" style="s2">unknowing there there is no clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.890" end="00:12:23.910" style="s2">discussion here of participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s a significant lacunae in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.910" end="00:12:27.089" style="s2">theory for the following reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:31.350" style="s2">without an account of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.089" end="00:12:32.910" style="s2">knowing for all of its claims the verve</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.350" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">a keen for our theory of being a process</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.910" end="00:12:38.130" style="s2">theory rather than a product theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">without talking about the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.130" end="00:12:44.370" style="s2">knowing it really can&#39;t incorporate into</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:46.620" style="s2">its account of becoming wise how one</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.370" end="00:12:50.070" style="s2">goes through transformational experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.620" end="00:12:52.050" style="s2">how one goes through modal change</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.070" end="00:12:53.880" style="s2">I mean modal in the existential sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.050" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">not the logical sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.880" end="00:13:01.380" style="s2">so without connecting participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:04.310" style="s2">knowing to this overarching schema the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.380" end="00:13:06.779" style="s2">connections between wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.400" end="00:13:13.320" style="s2">that we&#39;ve discussed are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.990" end="00:13:16.230" style="s2">crucially missing from this theory and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.320" end="00:13:16.960" style="s2">therefore its claim to being an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.230" end="00:13:19.780" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.960" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">theory can be rather significantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.780" end="00:13:28.420" style="s2">challenged I own I think that that so</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:31.540" style="s2">that needs important development we did</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.420" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">talk about a cognitive style that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.540" end="00:13:36.940" style="s2">could cultivate and one more thing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:40.420" style="s2">think what we were doing is also we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.940" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">smuggling in that the prospective</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.420" end="00:13:45.730" style="s2">all-knowing with the process of identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:50.290" style="s2">creation that&#39;s central to participatory</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.730" end="00:13:55.080" style="s2">knowing so I think that was also part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.290" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">the problem now what we did argue is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.080" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">that this is set within a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:06.490" style="s2">style that will give you a higher-order</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.490" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">way of regulating active open mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:11.350" style="s2">and mindfulness and here we took</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.980" end="00:14:14.110" style="s2">directly from the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.350" end="00:14:19.000" style="s2">tradition and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.110" end="00:14:21.100" style="s2">internalizing the sage right</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.000" end="00:14:23.860" style="s2">internalizing Socrates internalizing the</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.860" end="00:14:31.900" style="s2">the sage and we talked about what what</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.990" end="00:14:33.430" style="s2">impact that has so we you know what this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.900" end="00:14:34.690" style="s2">is internalized we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.430" end="00:14:36.340" style="s2">repeatedly what the process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.690" end="00:14:38.500" style="s2">internalization is what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.340" end="00:14:39.910" style="s2">internalize Socrates etc etc and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.500" end="00:14:43.270" style="s2">already seen how central that is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.910" end="00:14:47.100" style="s2">wisdom it&#39;s so well this is overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.270" end="00:14:47.100" style="s2">fallacious reasoning right</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:17.269" style="s2">self-deception but we also talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.560" end="00:15:19.640" style="s2">what does internalizing the sage do</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.269" end="00:15:21.320" style="s2">what&#39;s when you get that meta cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">enhancement you get that perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:25.430" style="s2">ability what&#39;s it doing so here we</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.660" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">talked about a virtue that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.430" end="00:15:32.450" style="s2">heard me talk about very much and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:36.140" style="s2">it&#39;s unfortunate because in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.450" end="00:15:38.300" style="s2">this this this is okay so the the Asia</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.140" end="00:15:41.200" style="s2">Greeks had four cardinal virtues wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.300" end="00:15:43.010" style="s2">which is really kind of a meadow virtue</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.200" end="00:15:46.850" style="s2">justice which we talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.010" end="00:15:48.950" style="s2">courage and then the fourth is this word</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.850" end="00:15:50.870" style="s2">softer son now softer son is often</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.950" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">translated as temperance doesn&#39;t capture</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.870" end="00:16:01.579" style="s2">it well moderation doesn&#39;t capture it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:16:04.490" style="s2">well so I want to to put aside that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.579" end="00:16:05.899" style="s2">try and come back at this but you see if</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.490" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">you went to the Delphic Oracle there</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.899" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">were things inscribed on the wall there</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:13.820" style="s2">and one was know thyself and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:15.170" style="s2">clearly you know connected and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.820" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">made it a zone and we&#39;ve come to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.170" end="00:16:18.829" style="s2">what that means how the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:21.709" style="s2">one&#39;s self is of course not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.829" end="00:16:23.990" style="s2">romantic autobiography but a deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.709" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">understanding of the principles by which</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.990" end="00:16:28.490" style="s2">you&#39;re operating but the other one was</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:31.699" style="s2">everything in moderation which was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.490" end="00:16:34.459" style="s2">this and it but that&#39;s not right that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.699" end="00:16:37.880" style="s2">again moderation is good but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.459" end="00:16:39.980" style="s2">quite right it&#39;s and we know this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.880" end="00:16:41.899" style="s2">connected to something like Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.980" end="00:16:43.880" style="s2">notion of the golden mean that all</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.899" end="00:16:45.050" style="s2">virtue and remember what that is you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.880" end="00:16:49.250" style="s2">tried to create you&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.050" end="00:16:52.010" style="s2">a virtual engine that right right</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.250" end="00:16:54.920" style="s2">generates enough options so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.010" end="00:16:57.019" style="s2">suffer vices of deficit but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.920" end="00:16:58.459" style="s2">generates enough right there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.019" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">governance there&#39;s enough selective</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.459" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">constraints so that it also forts vices</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.870" style="s2">of excess so there there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:11.630" style="s2">kind of optimization going on there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.870" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">as I said there which you get a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.630" end="00:17:15.440" style="s2">bit in the word moderation but modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:18.829" style="s2">raishin sounds more like averaging and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.440" end="00:17:20.270" style="s2">settling i we argued that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.829" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">better way of trying to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.270" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">by understanding it in something that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">was often contrasted which which is in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:36.710" style="s2">Crotty a-- so you know this word this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:39.850" style="s2">democracy uh right power or rule by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.710" end="00:17:43.340" style="s2">people and and krithia is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:49.300" style="s2">exercising power on yourself so this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.340" end="00:17:49.300" style="s2">kind of like self-restraint self-control</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.630" end="00:17:58.730" style="s2">and so a way of getting at this is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:18:02.110" style="s2">think about the the fact that you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.730" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">be practicing a virtue a virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.110" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">kradic lee or in a sort of cynic manner</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:13.790" style="s2">let me give you an example so here&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:18.680" style="s2">people there&#39;s Tom and there&#39;s Susan Tom</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.790" end="00:18:22.340" style="s2">is honest or at least he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.680" end="00:18:29.090" style="s2">become honest no Tom goes into</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.340" end="00:18:31.850" style="s2">situations and Tom sees clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.090" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">potential to lie and he thief clearly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.850" end="00:18:36.680" style="s2">the benefit that would accrue to him if</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:38.660" style="s2">he lies and it comes with a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.680" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">sort of temptation at there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.660" end="00:18:48.500" style="s2">tremendous impulse and so he exercises</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:50.600" style="s2">self-control and he doesn&#39;t lie and Tom</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.500" end="00:18:53.390" style="s2">is to be commended for that that is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.600" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">important kind of honesty but consider</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.390" end="00:19:02.150" style="s2">Susan Susan comes into a situation she</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:04.280" style="s2">clearly sees the opportunity to live</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.150" end="00:19:07.130" style="s2">she clearly sees the advantages that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.280" end="00:19:09.920" style="s2">were the crew to her if she lies but</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.130" end="00:19:11.930" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s like when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.920" end="00:19:13.820" style="s2">Frankfort and whether or not some it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.930" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">unthinkable to her not in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.820" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">that she can&#39;t think the thought I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">lie or think or imagine to herself like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not a viable option to her she</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:26.490" style="s2">can&#39;t she can&#39;t get into the existential</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.700" style="s2">mode where that draws on her</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.490" end="00:19:31.950" style="s2">anyway so although she can think it in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.700" end="00:19:34.429" style="s2">one sense in a Frankfort Ian sense it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.950" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">unthinkable to her it just she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.429" end="00:19:42.420" style="s2">tempted to lie in that sense many of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">myself included would side with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.420" end="00:19:49.740" style="s2">Greeks and saying susan is more honest</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">than Tom right because honesty is now</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.740" end="00:19:58.890" style="s2">second nature to Susan in a way it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:59.910" style="s2">to Tom so that&#39;s soft resan but at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.890" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">one aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.910" end="00:20:04.860" style="s2">do you remember we you you see that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:07.830" style="s2">remember when we were doing Paul and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.860" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">agape and Paul says now I will show you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.830" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">the most excellent way and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">talking of course about agape as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:17.820" style="s2">most excellent way and then he says</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:20.370" style="s2">remember in order to try and get you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.820" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">understand that the transformation when</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.370" end="00:20:24.630" style="s2">I was a child I thought like a child I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:26.280" style="s2">spoke like a child that acted like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.630" end="00:20:29.309" style="s2">child but when I became a man I put</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.280" end="00:20:31.050" style="s2">childish things behind me and remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.309" end="00:20:34.410" style="s2">we talked about that when your child</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.050" end="00:20:36.360" style="s2">your your deeply tempted by toys your</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.410" end="00:20:39.420" style="s2">salience landscape automatically</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.360" end="00:20:40.920" style="s2">organizes in a certain way but when</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.420" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re an adult when I&#39;m a man I come in</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.920" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">and I see Spencer&#39;s toys I know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.620" style="s2">they&#39;re there I know that I can play</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:50.390" style="s2">with them but they have no pull on me</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.620" end="00:20:53.429" style="s2">they do not call me they do not tempt me</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.390" end="00:20:55.890" style="s2">and as the child is to the adult the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.429" end="00:20:58.980" style="s2">adult is to this age this age has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.890" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">salience landscape in which they are not</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.980" end="00:21:05.220" style="s2">tempted to self-deception in the ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">that we so readily are that&#39;s soft</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.220" end="00:21:10.980" style="s2">person it is to have a salience</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:15.179" style="s2">landscape that has gone through a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.980" end="00:21:16.620" style="s2">of fundamental reversal it is not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.179" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">these are all differences of emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.620" end="00:21:22.679" style="s2">but like the way our seance landscape is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:26.850" style="s2">less oriented towards the self</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.679" end="00:21:29.730" style="s2">deceptiveness of a child the sages</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.850" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">salience landscape is less oriented</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.730" end="00:21:36.929" style="s2">towards our prevalent and pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:39.040" style="s2">forms of self-deception they see through</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.929" end="00:21:40.810" style="s2">illusion and into reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.040" end="00:21:44.800" style="s2">so this is of course deeply perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.810" end="00:21:51.850" style="s2">and and I want to add a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.800" end="00:21:54.910" style="s2">to it because it it&#39;s not just write it</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.850" end="00:21:56.440" style="s2">sorry you see the seat like in Taoism it</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.910" end="00:22:00.670" style="s2">comes through right</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.440" end="00:22:02.440" style="s2">the idea that right well look once</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.670" end="00:22:04.930" style="s2">you&#39;ve trained enough you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.440" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2">you just have to let you the sage can</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.930" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">just let things unfold naturally</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:13.450" style="s2">and you see this and you know even in</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:14.740" style="s2">Augustine you know love God and then do</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.450" end="00:22:16.420" style="s2">what you want of course you have to love</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.740" end="00:22:18.520" style="s2">God it that means if you really truly</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.420" end="00:22:20.800" style="s2">love God if agape is flowing through you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.520" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">as paul recommends then you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.800" end="00:22:24.790" style="s2">sovereign and then you will just you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:27.730" style="s2">will and this is what I want to say you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.790" end="00:22:29.850" style="s2">will be tempted to the good you will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.730" end="00:22:33.780" style="s2">tempted just like you can be tempted</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.850" end="00:22:36.040" style="s2">right your salience landscape naturally</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.990" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">in that and so this is a processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.500" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">theory as I&#39;ve mentioned I think there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.180" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">some important criticisms I would have</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.990" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">just argued that well perspective on our</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">sort of synthesizes these together I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s too simplistic a much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:54.160" style="s2">complex relationship I you see me argue</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.650" end="00:28:11.290" style="s2">mention a core aspect of this theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.920" end="00:28:14.920" style="s2">that I think is still central is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.290" end="00:28:17.680" style="s2">all of this all of this and we made this</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.680" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">came out I</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.160" style="s2">forgot to take a moment and explicate it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.060" end="00:28:26.990" style="s2">that all of this is about enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.160" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">relevance realization our main argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.990" end="00:28:31.640" style="s2">is that wisdom is some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.970" end="00:29:18.860" style="s2">is very important it connects wisdom to</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.620" end="00:30:37.789" style="s2">pointed many things a minute but</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:41.480" style="s2">something that central here is a theory</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.940" end="00:31:00.139" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand he doesn&#39;t have deep</p>

<p begin="00:31:00.139" end="00:31:05.119" style="s2">no no that&#39;s not right why speak one of</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.119" end="00:31:10.519" style="s2">information is by being more insightful</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.519" end="00:31:16.610" style="s2">information is like like avoiding bias</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.669" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">missing and we saw this you know our</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.269" end="00:31:39.590" style="s2">delt work very clearly we saw it implied</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:44.779" style="s2">in Sternberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.590" end="00:31:46.879" style="s2">and so right we should have taken this</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.779" end="00:31:50.419" style="s2">into account wisdom should also have</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.879" end="00:31:57.350" style="s2">within it a clear theory or connected to</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.649" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">enhance understanding what is it to</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.129" end="00:32:19.429" style="s2">not I&#39;m not in the place where I have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.940" end="00:32:20.990" style="s2">complete theory of understanding I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.429" end="00:32:25.720" style="s2">been doing a lot of work on it work that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.990" end="00:32:25.720" style="s2">I&#39;m actually doing with Leo Ferraro and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:31.970" style="s2">I and because that theory is still very</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.049" end="00:32:35.299" style="s2">much a work in progress I&#39;m also not</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.669" end="00:32:53.489" style="s2">so the criticisms have shown me many</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.489" end="00:32:58.289" style="s2">there&#39;s things that are underdeveloped</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.289" end="00:33:03.149" style="s2">however and I&#39;m going to try and address</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.080" end="00:33:07.710" style="s2">the understanding issue in a moment I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.149" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">would like to say nevertheless we we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.710" end="00:33:15.869" style="s2">see how all of the theories right</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:19.109" style="s2">converge including this one on relevance</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.460" end="00:33:40.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve made I think a plausible case for</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.379" end="00:34:00.139" style="s2">now what about understanding well we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.139" end="00:34:03.179" style="s2">already saw it invoked with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.139" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">grasping of significance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.179" end="00:34:06.179" style="s2">interesting in a completely independent</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.149" end="00:34:24.089" style="s2">a set of propositions right so there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.750" end="00:34:28.280" style="s2">the idea that understanding is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.089" end="00:34:31.140" style="s2">beyond possessing an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.280" end="00:34:33.090" style="s2">it&#39;s something above and beyond simply</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.140" end="00:34:35.850" style="s2">knowing we already saw with Keeks this</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.090" end="00:34:38.100" style="s2">idea of grasping the significance and I</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.710" end="00:34:47.190" style="s2">is if you take a look at the philosophy</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.190" end="00:34:52.290" style="s2">understanding goes beyond knowledge and</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.010" end="00:35:21.240" style="s2">think to go back to smellin right that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:23.640" style="s2">it has to do like we saw with grasping</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.240" end="00:35:24.870" style="s2">the relevance of what you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.640" end="00:35:26.820" style="s2">remember that was one of the key</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.820" end="00:35:31.560" style="s2">so in addition to all the implication</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.220" end="00:35:35.010" style="s2">relations and logical relations</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.730" end="00:38:02.339" style="s2">what&#39;s the contrast here okay you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:06.329" style="s2">want to say that somebody has understood</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.339" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">something and what that means is they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.329" end="00:38:10.710" style="s2">they&#39;ve grasped from the truth now they</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.069" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">will come out in a moment right</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.690" end="00:38:19.289" style="s2">but you can&#39;t say well if they didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.789" end="00:38:34.049" style="s2">right now are fault so I&#39;m actually not</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.030" end="00:38:42.990" style="s2">it to truth you might want to try it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.410" end="00:38:45.539" style="s2">more to something like rationality where</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.809" end="00:40:06.990" style="s2">how what what it is to say that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.740" end="00:40:08.490" style="s2">understands something is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.990" end="00:40:11.250" style="s2">good at you know being able to apply</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.099" end="00:40:20.700" style="s2">course it&#39;s this multi apt ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.559" end="00:40:22.500" style="s2">apply what they&#39;re they&#39;re good problem</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.900" end="00:40:32.030" style="s2">here of course is in</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">important capacity for problem finding</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.030" end="00:40:37.740" style="s2">somebody who has good understanding can</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.550" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">facilitate a need for they can motivate</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.740" end="00:40:42.120" style="s2">and facilitate a need for cognition</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:44.550" style="s2">because they can use that to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.120" end="00:40:49.340" style="s2">find and formulate problems perhaps zero</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.550" end="00:40:49.340" style="s2">in an important important problem Nexus</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.910" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">so and of course this optimal grip is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.740" end="00:41:02.190" style="s2">giving me something that regret the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:05.190" style="s2">regret or dirige it i don&#39;t know how he</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.190" end="00:41:08.220" style="s2">pronounces his name also talks about a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.190" end="00:41:10.110" style="s2">many people talk about the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.220" end="00:41:14.130" style="s2">understanding is contextually sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.110" end="00:41:15.720" style="s2">it&#39;s contextually relative to know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.130" end="00:41:18.660" style="s2">I understand something is relative to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.720" end="00:41:21.060" style="s2">the situation at hand and relative to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.660" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">the person at hand you and I can both</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.060" end="00:41:26.550" style="s2">know the same things right but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:29.880" style="s2">in situation in situation you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.550" end="00:41:31.590" style="s2">situation a in situation B you might</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.880" end="00:41:33.840" style="s2">understand those things because you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.590" end="00:41:35.220" style="s2">apply them in a I know I couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.840" end="00:41:39.930" style="s2">said to understand them as well cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.220" end="00:41:42.210" style="s2">can&#39;t apply them in situation B also</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.930" end="00:41:44.460" style="s2">right we could be in the same situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.210" end="00:41:46.740" style="s2">but I have a different set of skills and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.460" end="00:41:48.540" style="s2">so I can apply my knowledge better than</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.740" end="00:41:52.080" style="s2">you can I understand better than you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.540" end="00:41:57.840" style="s2">right so there&#39;s very much that this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.080" end="00:42:01.170" style="s2">context relative and I would then of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.840" end="00:42:02.850" style="s2">course context sensitive and you write</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.170" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">and that of course is the context</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.850" end="00:42:06.570" style="s2">sensitivity whereas this is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:08.310" style="s2">to do things in a much more context</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.570" end="00:42:10.020" style="s2">general way and of course I&#39;m invoking</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.310" end="00:42:12.540" style="s2">the machinery of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.020" end="00:42:14.420" style="s2">I&#39;m invoking in in in good control and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.540" end="00:42:17.420" style="s2">then the ability to transfer it right</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.420" end="00:42:17.420" style="s2">insightfully</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.080" end="00:42:28.180" style="s2">I would also argue that one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.270" end="00:42:34.540" style="s2">is needed right and you know where this</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.180" end="00:42:38.410" style="s2">because we&#39;ve already got the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.540" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">when if I am making these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.410" end="00:42:44.410" style="s2">forward commitments cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:50.020" style="s2">commitments they need to be backed by a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.410" end="00:42:52.870" style="s2">law of convergence so that my construct</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.020" end="00:42:56.550" style="s2">is also trustworthy I&#39;ve done a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.870" end="00:42:59.830" style="s2">of course to overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.550" end="00:43:02.470" style="s2">so if basic understanding is to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.830" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">the significance grasp right through</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.470" end="00:43:05.650" style="s2">relevance realization the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:09.160" style="s2">implication the relevant connections</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.650" end="00:43:12.360" style="s2">right this is what I&#39;m trying to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.160" end="00:43:15.310" style="s2">to you the basic understanding becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.360" end="00:43:17.010" style="s2">profound understanding when basic</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.310" end="00:43:20.010" style="s2">understanding is used to generate</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.010" end="00:43:20.010" style="s2">plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.900" end="00:43:35.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough because if</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.509" end="00:43:37.859" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me a sort of schematic way</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.789" end="00:43:40.740" style="s2">of putting it this is very horizontal it</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.859" end="00:43:43.529" style="s2">tells you how to bring different domains</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.740" end="00:43:45.299" style="s2">right together into your good Const role</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.529" end="00:43:47.339" style="s2">and then apply them to many domains and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.299" end="00:43:48.809" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the compression right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.339" end="00:43:50.249" style="s2">then you&#39;re doing the variation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.809" end="00:43:52.559" style="s2">doing the relevance realize the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.249" end="00:43:55.289" style="s2">compression variation right good problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.559" end="00:43:56.849" style="s2">formulation optimal gripping right this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.289" end="00:43:59.519" style="s2">is contextual e sensitive this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.849" end="00:44:03.869" style="s2">effectively right applied across in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.519" end="00:44:06.690" style="s2">cross contextual manner etc etc right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.869" end="00:44:08.509" style="s2">but I think understanding also has if</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.690" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me a vertical domain</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.509" end="00:44:15.900" style="s2">because I think part also of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:19.529" style="s2">profound understanding does is it aligns</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.900" end="00:44:26.759" style="s2">and optimizes the relationship but so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.529" end="00:44:28.980" style="s2">this is plausibility generation what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.759" end="00:44:32.809" style="s2">being aligned and optimized here I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.980" end="00:44:40.789" style="s2">are right the propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.809" end="00:44:44.509" style="s2">right the procedural perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.789" end="00:44:44.509" style="s2">the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.850" end="00:44:54.210" style="s2">I mean this goes back right somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.620" end="00:44:57.450" style="s2">really knew physics wouldn&#39;t just be</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.210" end="00:44:59.430" style="s2">grasping the propositions of physics</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.450" end="00:45:02.220" style="s2">they would be able to they&#39;d have the</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.510" end="00:45:14.490" style="s2">order to do physics well there might</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.570" end="00:45:18.210" style="s2">even be a participatory aspect to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.490" end="00:45:21.360" style="s2">they might have come to identify with</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.210" end="00:45:23.700" style="s2">the physicalist worldview and taken up</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.360" end="00:45:25.340" style="s2">their agency with respect to that</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.350" end="00:45:39.960" style="s2">interconnected and mutually facilitating</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.960" end="00:45:46.080" style="s2">would say of understanding the material</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.300" end="00:45:48.810" style="s2">so I think what needs to be developed is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.080" end="00:45:51.720" style="s2">a way of theoretically integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.810" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">horizontal that understanding is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.720" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">generate at least profound understanding</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:59.580" style="s2">is to take basic understanding grasping</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:01.470" style="s2">the relevance connections and make those</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.580" end="00:46:04.440" style="s2">relevance connections convergence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.470" end="00:46:06.450" style="s2">elegance optimal gripping so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.440" end="00:46:08.940" style="s2">profound understanding is to generate</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:10.980" style="s2">plausibility that&#39;s the horizontal but</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.940" end="00:46:14.130" style="s2">profound understanding is also to align</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.980" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">so you&#39;re getting grounding downward and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.130" end="00:46:18.840" style="s2">you&#39;re getting emergence upward right</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.710" end="00:46:47.770" style="s2">as I said what also needs to be aligned</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.460" end="00:46:51.220" style="s2">is transformational experience and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.770" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">means an account of nasus needs to also</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.109" end="00:47:41.000" style="s2">transformative experience there&#39;s of</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.260" end="00:47:49.730" style="s2">and so it has very much important</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:47.569" style="s2">do one you join a music appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.030" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">class okay and so we&#39;re using the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.569" end="00:48:50.420" style="s2">appreciation here not in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.549" style="s2">gratitude but how it&#39;s used when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.420" end="00:48:54.260" style="s2">people talk about music appreciation art</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.549" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">appreciation so you joining music</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.260" end="00:48:58.520" style="s2">appreciation for class class what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">make you a good student and the music</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.520" end="00:49:02.089" style="s2">appreciation class if you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">because you want to impress your</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.089" end="00:49:08.420" style="s2">girlfriend or your boyfriend or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">there because every time you go you pass</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.420" end="00:49:12.109" style="s2">the chocolate store and you buy some</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:13.880" style="s2">chocolate right and that sort of or</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.109" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">you&#39;re there because you&#39;re just trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.880" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">to get a credit the person teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:19.730" style="s2">music appreciation is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.589" style="s2">regard you as a good student because why</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.730" end="00:49:23.810" style="s2">because the goal of music appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.589" end="00:49:26.180" style="s2">is to come to value music for its own</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.810" end="00:49:28.340" style="s2">sake it&#39;s it&#39;s to come to front it is to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.180" end="00:49:30.290" style="s2">come to finding music intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.340" end="00:49:32.210" style="s2">valuable and therefore something that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.290" end="00:49:33.740" style="s2">directly relevant to your meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.210" end="00:49:37.640" style="s2">life something that you directly care</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.740" end="00:49:39.650" style="s2">about now the thing is if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.640" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">good now think of the paradox here and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.650" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">this is so beautiful the way keller</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:45.860" style="s2">brings it up if I was a good student I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:47.750" style="s2">would appreciate music for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.860" end="00:49:49.340" style="s2">but if I appreciated music for its own</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.750" end="00:49:54.410" style="s2">sake I do not need to take the music</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.340" end="00:49:56.510" style="s2">appreciation class right do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.410" end="00:49:57.890" style="s2">paradox here and then Keller points it</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.510" end="00:49:59.000" style="s2">this is the same thing when you decide</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:01.010" style="s2">you&#39;re going to undertake a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.000" end="00:50:03.770" style="s2">education the liberal education is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.010" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">to give you values and preferences that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.770" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">you don&#39;t currently have right so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">idea is the music-appreciation so what</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:21.410" style="s2">do you do there how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:22.220" style="s2">break through that dilemma now let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.410" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">very clear</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.220" end="00:50:28.130" style="s2">colored is in agreement with la paul</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:29.810" style="s2">that you can&#39;t get through this in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.130" end="00:50:34.100" style="s2">inferential fashion for all of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.810" end="00:50:36.250" style="s2">arguments we&#39;ve already seen right she</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.100" end="00:50:39.020" style="s2">talks about it she does make something</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.250" end="00:50:42.050" style="s2">clear that I don&#39;t think this is clear</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.020" end="00:50:44.810" style="s2">in Paul&#39;s work she talks about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.050" end="00:50:48.560" style="s2">that this process this process of trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.810" end="00:50:50.390" style="s2">to acquire right an appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.560" end="00:50:56.330" style="s2">something as intrinsically valuable she</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.390" end="00:50:58.430" style="s2">calls this process aspiration where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.330" end="00:51:00.440" style="s2">might call this process more inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.430" end="00:51:01.910" style="s2">the sudden insight right inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.440" end="00:51:05.390" style="s2">versus aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.910" end="00:51:07.340" style="s2">so you&#39;re aspiring and she points out</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.390" end="00:51:10.850" style="s2">something that I think is really clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.340" end="00:51:13.850" style="s2">that this has to be a forum this has to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.850" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">be something that can be seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.850" end="00:51:17.930" style="s2">rational process now of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">ways in which we can screw this up but</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.930" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">what she wants to argue is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:25.150" style="s2">a form of rationality appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:27.500" style="s2">aspiration she calls it proleptic</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.150" end="00:51:28.940" style="s2">rationality probably like when you gave</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.230" end="00:56:11.960" style="s2">aspiration is deeply bound up I would</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.360" end="00:56:15.010" style="s2">argue with gnosis and then something</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.960" end="00:56:17.060" style="s2">that Callard doesn&#39;t talk at all about</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.010" end="00:56:20.869" style="s2">but we&#39;ve already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.060" end="00:56:25.420" style="s2">I think aspiration is deeply connected</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.420" end="00:56:33.590" style="s2">almost like Socratic aporia your world</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.010" end="00:56:52.850" style="s2">the appropriate placeholder in place</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.450" end="00:56:54.590" style="s2">that&#39;s the beginnings of a psychological</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.590" end="00:57:00.350" style="s2">aspiration so I think we can bring what</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.790" end="00:57:03.230" style="s2">was needed for a theory of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.350" end="00:57:06.350" style="s2">because of course philosophy ah we</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.230" end="00:57:08.990" style="s2">aspire to wisdom and and we always</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.350" end="00:57:10.070" style="s2">aspire to wisdom because to claim and</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.990" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">this is a deep point that we&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.070" end="00:57:16.730" style="s2">wisdom is kind of a mistake so we need</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:19.670" style="s2">an account of understanding an account</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.730" end="00:57:22.250" style="s2">right of gnosis and and these are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.670" end="00:57:24.740" style="s2">related and an account of aspiration we</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.250" end="00:57:27.890" style="s2">need them to be further explicate it</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.740" end="00:57:31.190" style="s2">integrated and then integrated with the</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.190" end="00:57:46.690" style="s2">arguing for already okay I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.460" end="00:57:48.920" style="s2">and draw this all together now so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.690" end="00:57:51.290" style="s2">point to what&#39;s going on because I&#39;m</p>
