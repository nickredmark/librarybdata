<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:11.049" style="s2">meaning has been ignored by Hegel so we</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.090" end="00:04:18.280" style="s2">means that framing and formulating the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.849" end="00:04:21.070" style="s2">problem at the political level is too</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.280" end="00:04:23.260" style="s2">radically miss frame it and miss</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.070" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">formulate it and then I propose to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.260" end="00:04:29.460" style="s2">that instead we turn to an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">way of trying to reformulate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.460" end="00:04:36.729" style="s2">that we try and get a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">understanding as best we can the meaning</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">participate within we don&#39;t just simply</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.040" end="00:04:49.550" style="s2">I&#39;ll often say meaning-making but as</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:51.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll argue we don&#39;t just we don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">meaning the way the romantics said</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.740" end="00:04:56.419" style="s2">neither we do we just receive meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">from the world the way the empiricists</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.419" end="00:05:01.040" style="s2">and the Enlightenment argued right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:03.139" style="s2">gonna see that it&#39;s neither one of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.040" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s another dichotomy that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.139" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">transcend but nevertheless let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:12.470" style="s2">this machinery the machinery of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">realization what are the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.470" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">processes at work within it and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.570" style="s2">propose that we do that from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">scientific worldview precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.570" end="00:05:28.100" style="s2">at least from a scientific point of view</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">precisely because we need that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:33.740" style="s2">complement the historical analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:37.100" style="s2">because the scientific worldview is part</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.740" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">of the problem of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.100" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">itself so I propose we take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">the science of cognition and that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.050" style="s2">that we take a look at cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:52.220" style="s2">I am a cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.050" end="00:05:53.300" style="s2">professionally but as I said from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.220" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">very beginning of this series I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.300" end="00:05:58.490" style="s2">offering you a particular interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:59.630" style="s2">of how to do cognitive science not</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.490" end="00:06:01.729" style="s2">everybody in cognitive science would</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.630" end="00:06:05.000" style="s2">agree with me but I think it is viable</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.729" end="00:06:06.890" style="s2">and respectable version of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.000" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">science that can be argued for what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.890" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">that idea is the idea that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:16.010" style="s2">science is born out of a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:17.720" style="s2">in which the scientific study of mine is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.010" end="00:06:19.070" style="s2">unfolded and it ends as I indicated last</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.720" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">time it&#39;s a way that has actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.070" end="00:06:25.550" style="s2">contributed significantly to a version</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:27.950" style="s2">of the meaning crisis that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.550" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">personal deeply into the very guts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.950" end="00:06:34.510" style="s2">our minds and bodies all right and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">has to do with the idea that this term</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.510" end="00:06:43.789" style="s2">has now become equivocal and we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:45.410" style="s2">back to that in a minute because we</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.789" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">actually are talking about different</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.410" end="00:06:50.740" style="s2">things or at least different levels of</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:13.240" style="s2">actually make the machines and processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.110" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">different ontology different methodology</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.240" end="00:08:19.420" style="s2">etc then we of course we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">understanding - behavior and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.420" end="00:08:23.590" style="s2">psychology and here we talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">like working memory and problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.590" end="00:08:28.510" style="s2">decision making and we and we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:32.130" style="s2">experimentation on human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.510" end="00:08:34.890" style="s2">statistical analysis again different</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:38.680" style="s2">ontology different theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.890" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">vocabulary different methods of studying</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:43.090" style="s2">the phenomenon of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:45.400" style="s2">presenting evidence right and we noted</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.090" end="00:08:47.710" style="s2">throughout that there are attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.400" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">create hybrids between the various</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.710" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">disciplines so these are the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:57.580" style="s2">reality here and these are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:08:59.770" style="s2">disciplines here right because above</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.580" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">this as we said we have language because</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.770" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">of the tremendously important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">special role that language plays with</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:12.769" style="s2">to being a medium for mind and being a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:16.759" style="s2">way of communicating mind and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.769" end="00:09:18.379" style="s2">here we have linguistics and we might</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.759" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">get psycho linguistics to try and bridge</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.379" end="00:09:22.850" style="s2">between them right but nevertheless in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:25.459" style="s2">linguistics we&#39;re talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.850" end="00:09:27.410" style="s2">like you know sentence structures and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:28.670" style="s2">rules of transformation and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.410" end="00:09:33.170" style="s2">gathering different kinds of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:35.149" style="s2">etc and then the networking of minds and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.170" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">brains together through language and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.149" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">behavior as culture and that studied by</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.809" style="s2">anthropology and that has a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">different method this really emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.809" end="00:09:45.800" style="s2">the perspectival and the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:50.269" style="s2">so you do participant observation you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.800" end="00:09:55.639" style="s2">write ethnographies right and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.269" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">that helps to give one of the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.639" end="00:09:59.689" style="s2">of science it helps to formulate you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">know and specialize people so they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.689" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">get much more precise analysis and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.670" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">this is a good thing I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:09.199" style="s2">in any way despise this but it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:12.679" style="s2">problematic in that it carries with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.199" end="00:10:16.519" style="s2">first of all it fragments us well this</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.679" end="00:10:18.529" style="s2">term mine has now become equivocal what</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.519" end="00:10:21.259" style="s2">are we talking about when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.529" end="00:10:24.379" style="s2">about our mind and and related</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.259" end="00:10:25.910" style="s2">constructs like our self so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.379" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">remember what equivocation is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.910" end="00:10:30.949" style="s2">equivocation is when you fall into</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:33.790" style="s2">confusion precisely because you do not</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.949" end="00:10:38.439" style="s2">keep track of the meaning of your terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.790" end="00:10:43.339" style="s2">so here&#39;s one of my favorites right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.439" end="00:10:48.589" style="s2">nothing is better then long life and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.339" end="00:10:53.959" style="s2">happiness kind of something that you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.589" end="00:10:55.579" style="s2">in Star Trek right great and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.959" end="00:10:58.839" style="s2">say to you a peanut butter and jelly</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.579" end="00:10:58.839" style="s2">sandwich is better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.689" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">okay so nothing is better than long life</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.489" end="00:11:17.730" style="s2">and happiness and a peanut butter and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.129" style="s2">jelly sandwich is better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.730" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">there go a peanut butter and jelly</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.129" end="00:11:29.749" style="s2">sandwich is better than long life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">happiness so you know what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.749" end="00:11:35.699" style="s2">you should eat nope a peanut butter</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:44.100" style="s2">jelly sandwich and then commit suicide</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.699" end="00:11:48.119" style="s2">now that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.100" end="00:11:49.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s the whole point not this</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.119" end="00:11:51.119" style="s2">should not convince you to eat a peanut</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.559" end="00:11:53.249" style="s2">butter and jelly sandwich to end commit</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.119" end="00:11:56.369" style="s2">suicide it&#39;s designed to convince you of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.249" end="00:11:58.879" style="s2">the the ridiculousness of this argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.369" end="00:12:02.069" style="s2">now why is the argument ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.879" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2">because I&#39;m used the argument hinges on</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.069" end="00:12:10.829" style="s2">the this right and that because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.100" end="00:12:13.079" style="s2">using the same term it sounds like I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.829" end="00:12:16.259" style="s2">make the inference but of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.079" end="00:12:18.119" style="s2">although I&#39;m using the same word I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.259" end="00:12:19.829" style="s2">meaning the same thing this means no</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.119" end="00:12:22.110" style="s2">thing from the set of things that makes</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.829" end="00:12:24.569" style="s2">life worth living is better than long</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.110" end="00:12:26.129" style="s2">life and happiness this means no thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.569" end="00:12:27.959" style="s2">from this set of things you should eat</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.129" end="00:12:30.089" style="s2">and those are not equivalent sets</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.959" end="00:12:32.339" style="s2">there&#39;s not equivalent reference that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.089" end="00:12:35.309" style="s2">you don&#39;t keep track of what your words</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.339" end="00:12:37.769" style="s2">mean that&#39;s why we I&#39;m always so careful</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.309" end="00:12:39.089" style="s2">to try and give you like the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.769" end="00:12:41.879" style="s2">things in the history of the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.089" end="00:12:44.119" style="s2">a term if you don&#39;t get sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.879" end="00:12:49.019" style="s2">meaning of terms you&#39;ll fall into</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.119" end="00:12:56.429" style="s2">equivocation which is a disastrous way</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.019" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">to try and reason about anything okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.429" end="00:13:02.339" style="s2">what&#39;s the point of that well the term</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">mind isn&#39;t univocal they can be what am</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.339" end="00:13:06.389" style="s2">I talking about am I talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:07.739" style="s2">am I talking about this am I talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.389" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">about this am I talking about this am I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.739" end="00:13:10.860" style="s2">talking mother my time about how this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:13.529" style="s2">and this I&#39;m I talk about this don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.860" end="00:13:16.649" style="s2">know and the degree to which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.529" end="00:13:18.329" style="s2">equivocal without realizing it is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.649" end="00:13:21.490" style="s2">degree to which my thinking about my</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.329" end="00:13:27.520" style="s2">mind and therefore mice</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.490" end="00:13:30.550" style="s2">self is ridiculous if you aren&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.520" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">about what this word means how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.550" end="00:13:36.220" style="s2">using this concept you will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:44.170" style="s2">bullshitting yourself through</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:46.980" style="s2">equivocation I also pointed out that one</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.170" end="00:13:51.670" style="s2">of the consequences of this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.980" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">fragmentation what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.670" end="00:13:57.010" style="s2">well there&#39;s a couple is an ignorant in</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:58.870" style="s2">this and again I&#39;m not I am not</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.010" end="00:14:01.450" style="s2">disparaging these Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.870" end="00:14:04.390" style="s2">I love these Sciences I&#39;ve got education</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.450" end="00:14:08.380" style="s2">in them and I value them that is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.390" end="00:14:10.390" style="s2">what is happening here but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.380" end="00:14:13.750" style="s2">things that is missing that we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.390" end="00:14:16.899" style="s2">ignorant of in this model is this these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.750" end="00:14:21.160" style="s2">various levels of reality causally</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.899" end="00:14:24.310" style="s2">impact and constrain each other in very</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.310" end="00:14:28.810" style="s2">disciplines don&#39;t capture that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.410" end="00:14:31.510" style="s2">why there&#39;s this constant temptation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.810" end="00:14:40.779" style="s2">need to create the hybrids like psycho</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.510" end="00:14:43.300" style="s2">linguistics so how are we going to study</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.779" end="00:14:46.360" style="s2">therefore the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.300" end="00:14:49.029" style="s2">levels we have to get the disciplines to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.360" end="00:14:51.490" style="s2">hybridize or beyond that to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.029" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">other to integrate together in some</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">ignorance and that has to be an astute</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.910" end="00:15:04.450" style="s2">practice we can&#39;t just we can&#39;t just</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.450" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">through equivocation because that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.220" end="00:15:12.990" style="s2">bullshitting so what we have to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.730" style="s2">have to have a philosophically astute</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">an interdisciplinary science now I hope</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:40.570" style="s2">you see that cognitive science is</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.290" end="00:19:20.520" style="s2">understand it as is it as a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.350" end="00:19:44.170" style="s2">neuroscientist but I I read a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.790" end="00:19:46.210" style="s2">psychology or perhaps linguistics and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.170" end="00:19:49.150" style="s2">then I pick some ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.210" end="00:19:51.460" style="s2">interesting from the other disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.150" end="00:19:53.110" style="s2">and you know when I use them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.460" end="00:19:55.000" style="s2">sometimes I I&#39;ll tell some of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.110" end="00:19:56.560" style="s2">linguists or psychological friends some</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:19:58.420" style="s2">of the things I&#39;m doing in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.560" end="00:20:01.060" style="s2">and some of those ideas might interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.420" end="00:20:02.950" style="s2">them and of course that&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.060" end="00:20:06.610" style="s2">people are free to do this and the model</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.950" end="00:20:09.910" style="s2">for this right is you know kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.610" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">I mean this as an analogy you know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.910" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">we have an interfaith dialogue see the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:17.830" style="s2">whole point about interfaith dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:20.830" style="s2">you know the Christians and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.830" end="00:20:22.870" style="s2">Buddhists talk and you know I find</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.830" end="00:20:24.430" style="s2">something interesting the sama Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.870" end="00:20:26.140" style="s2">and Christianity and the Christians to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.430" end="00:20:29.970" style="s2">find something interesting me and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.140" end="00:20:32.290" style="s2">talk but we&#39;re not trying to Brad eclis</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.970" end="00:20:33.340" style="s2">transform each other there&#39;s no sense in</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.290" end="00:20:38.560" style="s2">which there&#39;s going to be a really</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.980" end="00:20:48.970" style="s2">Buddhism than Christianity it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.290" end="00:20:50.680" style="s2">after we do the interfaith dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.970" end="00:20:53.860" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have come up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.680" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">religion now I use that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:21:01.000" style="s2">precisely because I think it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:21:03.190" style="s2">right for understanding now the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.000" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">interfaith dialogue is to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.190" end="00:21:07.960" style="s2">enhance mutual understanding and build</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.880" end="00:21:15.670" style="s2">not I&#39;m not disparaging this but notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.910" end="00:21:17.410" style="s2">the problem here notice it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.670" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">capturing why people feel so strongly</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.410" end="00:21:22.150" style="s2">you know drawn towards creating things</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">like psycho linguistics that bridge</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.150" end="00:21:26.620" style="s2">between them the different disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:29.610" style="s2">see the problem with this is it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">it&#39;s neither too weak or too strong this</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.610" end="00:21:34.840" style="s2">can very quickly just become there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.840" end="00:21:39.510" style="s2">disciplines there&#39;s some interest</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.130" end="00:21:43.180" style="s2">there&#39;s some creation of mutual respect</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.510" end="00:21:46.330" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the case that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.180" end="00:21:48.130" style="s2">capturing significant theoretically</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.909" end="00:24:18.760" style="s2">okay but I&#39;m trying to use metaphor as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.929" end="00:24:20.529" style="s2">way of saying that there is already a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.760" end="00:24:22.419" style="s2">cognitive ability in us that we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.529" end="00:24:23.860" style="s2">exact and make use of in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.419" end="00:24:28.210" style="s2">science look look at how a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.860" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">works okay if I say to you but and Sam</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.210" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">as a human being if I say to you Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:38.890" style="s2">a pig right notice what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">in order to make this work so it looks</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.890" end="00:24:43.149" style="s2">like I&#39;m creating an identity claim Sam</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:45.190" style="s2">is a pig but of course what makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.149" end="00:24:47.350" style="s2">metaphor is it&#39;s not an identity claim I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.190" end="00:24:49.809" style="s2">can&#39;t use this as a way of telling you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.350" end="00:24:51.460" style="s2">that Sam has pink skin and he lives on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.809" end="00:24:53.559" style="s2">farm and he&#39;s gonna be eaten by other</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.460" end="00:24:55.390" style="s2">human beings someday okay that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.559" end="00:24:58.809" style="s2">what I need I mean something like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.390" end="00:25:02.010" style="s2">gluttonous or he&#39;s you know sexually</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.809" end="00:25:05.529" style="s2">selfish or something like that right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.010" end="00:25:10.029" style="s2">notice what I have to do I have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.529" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">the two different while also saying how</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.029" end="00:25:15.240" style="s2">they&#39;re importantly the same now why am</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:18.610" style="s2">i doing that because that difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.240" end="00:25:20.710" style="s2">right that difference gets me outside of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.610" end="00:25:22.600" style="s2">myself here&#39;s my framing of Sam and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.710" end="00:25:24.669" style="s2">difference gets me outside of my framing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.600" end="00:25:25.929" style="s2">of Sam and I look through this I look</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.669" end="00:25:28.090" style="s2">through if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.929" end="00:25:32.770" style="s2">you know the framing of something as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.090" end="00:25:34.870" style="s2">pig and I used this to look and see</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.770" end="00:25:39.669" style="s2">something in Sam away in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.870" end="00:25:42.309" style="s2">identical so I stepped back through the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.669" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">difference but I step I look through</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.309" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">into the identity and I see thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:51.610" style="s2">in Sam through my Pig lenses if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:54.070" style="s2">allow the metaphor and I allow it allows</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.610" end="00:25:55.480" style="s2">me to see and understand Sam in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.070" end="00:26:01.900" style="s2">different way it alters what I consider</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.480" end="00:26:05.950" style="s2">salient in Sam it restructures and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.900" end="00:26:07.870" style="s2">metaphor has this duality about it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.950" end="00:26:12.520" style="s2">what you want to do is you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.870" end="00:26:16.420" style="s2">want to create a metaphor that balances</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.520" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">these in an appropriate way when a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.420" end="00:26:22.180" style="s2">metaphor when a metaphor balances these</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:27.340" style="s2">these what these two well we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.180" end="00:26:29.770" style="s2">a metaphor being apt so notice if I make</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.340" end="00:26:33.820" style="s2">the identity relation too strong if I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.770" end="00:26:38.050" style="s2">emphasize this side too much and I say</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.820" end="00:26:40.750" style="s2">bees are Hornets you don&#39;t think oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.050" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">what a great metaphor that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.750" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">such a wonderful metaphor in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:47.860" style="s2">a really crappy metaphor right this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:50.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give me enough distance I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.860" end="00:26:52.750" style="s2">step back enough and have an insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.680" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">into this this provokes no insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.750" end="00:26:56.890" style="s2">there&#39;s no insightful transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:27:00.970" style="s2">my understanding of bees this is too</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.890" end="00:27:03.370" style="s2">close but if I if I emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.970" end="00:27:09.810" style="s2">difference too much something like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.370" end="00:27:11.710" style="s2">know arguments or chairs well you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.810" end="00:27:14.440" style="s2">arguments of chairs because they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.710" end="00:27:16.660" style="s2">human-made structures and we use them on</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.440" end="00:27:20.350" style="s2">a day-to-day basis and this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.660" end="00:27:22.690" style="s2">crappy metaphor precisely because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.350" end="00:27:25.390" style="s2">know the difference is too great I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.690" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">stepped back so much if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.390" end="00:27:29.260" style="s2">I&#39;m losing sight of this and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:32.290" style="s2">clear it&#39;s vague how what am I supposed</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.260" end="00:27:39.130" style="s2">to see about arguments through this</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.290" end="00:27:41.500" style="s2">distant lens of chairs apt is when I get</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.130" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">an appropriate balance of that so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.500" end="00:27:46.090" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for I&#39;m writing cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">science is I&#39;m looking for theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.090" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">constructs proposed theoretical entities</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:55.480" style="s2">that get this apt balance that allow me</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:58.360" style="s2">to keep the differences between the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.480" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">disciplines but you know but also</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.360" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">see from and through those distances</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:11.790" style="s2">relevant identities that allow me right</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:14.530" style="s2">to look from neuroscience into</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.790" end="00:28:19.920" style="s2">artificial intelligence in an insightful</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.530" end="00:28:23.410" style="s2">way or look from I step back from right</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.920" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">behavior in psychology I go I step into</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.410" end="00:28:28.290" style="s2">linguistics and then I look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:30.790" style="s2">psychology I keep that distance I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.290" end="00:28:33.010" style="s2">identify them but I also try and see ah</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.790" end="00:28:34.840" style="s2">but what is that what can I see in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.010" end="00:28:36.900" style="s2">psychology through the lens and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.840" end="00:28:40.270" style="s2">linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.900" end="00:28:41.590" style="s2">now of course the thing about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.270" end="00:28:44.110" style="s2">science is it&#39;s not trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.590" end="00:28:46.150" style="s2">single aptness right it&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.110" end="00:28:48.250" style="s2">create a one this is one way I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:49.630" style="s2">bridged between two domains cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.250" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">science is trying to create constructs</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.630" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">that are multi apt that bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:58.840" style="s2">multiple domains multiple disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:07.270" style="s2">and that multi aptness is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:15.700" style="s2">important so I&#39;m trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.270" end="00:29:18.850" style="s2">constructs with multi aptness they get</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.700" end="00:29:22.500" style="s2">this balance between identity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.850" end="00:29:26.200" style="s2">difference that affords and provokes</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.500" end="00:29:28.030" style="s2">insightful transformation of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.200" end="00:29:29.290" style="s2">theorizing from one discipline to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.030" end="00:29:36.490" style="s2">another and I start to create an</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.290" end="00:29:40.300" style="s2">overarching integration now this brings</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.490" end="00:29:42.730" style="s2">up an important idea but well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.300" end="00:29:45.160" style="s2">constraining me how do I know like</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.730" end="00:29:48.930" style="s2">what&#39;s how do I judge if I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.160" end="00:29:48.930" style="s2">well or badly</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.480" end="00:30:00.100" style="s2">well this has to do I think with this</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.549" end="00:30:03.580" style="s2">notion that is very much the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.100" end="00:30:08.580" style="s2">we use when we&#39;re considering how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.580" end="00:30:11.169" style="s2">create new constructs new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.580" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">theoretical entities that will bridge</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.169" end="00:30:15.159" style="s2">the between domains create lines of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">inquiry this is plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.159" end="00:30:19.149" style="s2">now there&#39;s two meanings to this word</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">one is just a synonym for high</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.149" end="00:30:25.029" style="s2">probability and that&#39;s not the one I</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.810" end="00:32:09.320" style="s2">and this time I can go into these many</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.430" end="00:32:16.360" style="s2">different domains I can do this</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2">think this is a much better wave this</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.900" end="00:32:30.470" style="s2">problems I think this is a much better</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.670" end="00:32:31.940" style="s2">understanding of what scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">trying to invoke when they say a theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.940" end="00:32:36.950" style="s2">is elegant right then just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">simplicity precisely because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.950" end="00:32:41.060" style="s2">we have no canonical way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">work out what scientists are meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.060" end="00:32:46.550" style="s2">when they talk about simplicity whereas</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:50.090" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that they do seek constructs</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.550" end="00:32:51.890" style="s2">to do this now here&#39;s a problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.090" end="00:32:54.350" style="s2">good enough is that is that good enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.890" end="00:32:57.380" style="s2">to make a construct plausible no see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.350" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">problem with that is if it&#39;s just on its</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.380" end="00:33:03.500" style="s2">own right we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re lacking</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.500" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">that we want and this is a point</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:11.140" style="s2">actually made by rusher and it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:14.180" style="s2">in some of the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.140" end="00:33:15.800" style="s2">plausibility you see we also want that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.180" end="00:33:17.510" style="s2">these constructs are produced in a</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.510" end="00:33:22.730" style="s2">they&#39;re used but this is how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.880" end="00:33:24.050" style="s2">produced right this is their forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.730" end="00:33:26.900" style="s2">orientation this is their backward</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.050" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">orientation we want a construct that has</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:36.230" style="s2">independent lines of Investigation now</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.940" end="00:33:39.530" style="s2">let me show you just a concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.230" end="00:33:43.750" style="s2">of this right and you can see it even in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.530" end="00:33:46.520" style="s2">young kids you prefer information that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.750" end="00:33:51.530" style="s2">right integrates think about integration</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.520" end="00:33:54.230" style="s2">across multiple senses right so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.530" end="00:33:56.120" style="s2">prefer information that is not not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.230" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">something you can see but also you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.120" end="00:33:58.940" style="s2">simultaneously here</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.190" style="s2">that&#39;s why seeing and hearing me right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.940" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">now is better than just seeing me or</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.190" end="00:34:10.280" style="s2">just hearing me now why is that the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:12.730" style="s2">well you see if if I&#39;m getting all of my</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.280" end="00:34:15.050" style="s2">information just through one channel</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.730" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a very good chance that this</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.050" end="00:34:22.900" style="s2">thing is being produced by bias</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:24.880" style="s2">by distortion in that channel but if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.900" end="00:34:28.770" style="s2">getting the same thing produced by from</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.880" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">multiple independent channels right</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a very good chance that is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:35.560" style="s2">being produced by the bias or distortion</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:37.240" style="s2">in any one of these there&#39;s a chance</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.560" end="00:34:39.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s a very good chance that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.240" end="00:34:42.250" style="s2">they&#39;re relative that the the relative</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.490" end="00:34:47.890" style="s2">biases and distortions cancel each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.250" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">out so by doing convergence I get bias</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.890" end="00:34:53.020" style="s2">reduction and man does that matter it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:56.890" style="s2">for overcoming the way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.020" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">bullshit ourselves with salience so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.890" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">convergence gives me biased reduction</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:04.810" style="s2">what rest shark alls trustworthiness now</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:08.950" style="s2">trustworthiness isn&#39;t truth it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.810" end="00:35:12.490" style="s2">certainty this by the way is why science</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.950" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">likes numbers scientists like numbers</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.490" end="00:35:16.690" style="s2">not because we&#39;re fascists or because we</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:17.410" style="s2">don&#39;t appreciate the artistic beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.690" end="00:35:19.570" style="s2">bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.410" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">we like numbers because they give us</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.570" end="00:35:31.990" style="s2">this look you can see three you can hear</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:33.810" style="s2">three you can touch three numbers afford</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.990" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">convergence and they boost</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.810" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">trustworthiness they would help to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:41.050" style="s2">reduce bias and remember I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:43.930" style="s2">argue that the scientific method of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.050" end="00:35:45.880" style="s2">experimentation is a method right in</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.930" end="00:35:47.650" style="s2">which we are trying a methods of sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.880" end="00:35:49.570" style="s2">the scientific method of experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.650" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">and observation our methods psycho</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:57.400" style="s2">reduce bias reduce the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.760" end="00:36:02.470" style="s2">we&#39;re deceiving how we&#39;re coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.400" end="00:36:04.360" style="s2">our constructs now think about this if</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.470" end="00:36:07.270" style="s2">you had just elegance</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.360" end="00:36:09.460" style="s2">that&#39;s multi aptness you can bridge to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.270" end="00:36:11.770" style="s2">many different areas and link lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.460" end="00:36:14.010" style="s2">stuff together but it wasn&#39;t produced in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.770" end="00:36:17.190" style="s2">a trustworthy manner what would you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.010" end="00:36:20.050" style="s2">you would have conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.190" end="00:36:22.690" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.050" end="00:36:25.330" style="s2">do their form of bullshitting because</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.690" end="00:36:27.550" style="s2">they are they&#39;re they&#39;re very a look if</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.330" end="00:36:30.760" style="s2">you will just accept that the british</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.760" end="00:36:35.410" style="s2">from another dimension you can explain</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.890" end="00:36:37.750" style="s2">so much of their political and social</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.410" end="00:36:40.120" style="s2">and interpersonal behavior just give me</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.750" end="00:36:41.890" style="s2">this idea just give me this and look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.120" end="00:36:44.590" style="s2">what I can do look at all the different</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.890" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">disparate facts I can link and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.590" end="00:36:49.510" style="s2">together I can give you the synoptic</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:53.110" style="s2">integration and you should be saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.510" end="00:36:56.170" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s all bullshit it&#39;s bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.110" end="00:36:58.330" style="s2">because we find this we want this so</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.170" end="00:37:00.490" style="s2">it&#39;s very salient but it&#39;s bullshit</p>

<p begin="00:37:06.100" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">the opposite so the conspiracy theory is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.030" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">far-fetched because it gives us lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.270" style="s2">this but very very little convergence</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:19.120" style="s2">what about this where I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.270" end="00:37:20.710" style="s2">tremendous convergence certainly we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.120" end="00:37:24.820" style="s2">like this and there&#39;s just there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.710" end="00:37:27.490" style="s2">little insight integration what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.820" end="00:37:29.740" style="s2">well if you read scientific journals</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.490" end="00:37:32.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll see people and even beyond</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.680" end="00:37:38.410" style="s2">is this up here this is the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.320" end="00:37:43.750" style="s2">theory and it&#39;s far-fetched but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.410" end="00:37:46.210" style="s2">what this is this is triviality and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.750" end="00:37:49.560" style="s2">reject things now excuse something of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.210" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">being trivial as to not say it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.560" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s to say that it has no</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">transformative power it makes no</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">difference it causes no insight it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.260" style="s2">affords no integration so this tells me</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">this tells us something and notice</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.260" end="00:38:10.870" style="s2">notice notice notice ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:13.150" style="s2">can equivocate on these right between we</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.870" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">can equivocate between this right</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.150" end="00:38:18.520" style="s2">between these two so Daniel Dennett</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:19.840" style="s2">talks about this and there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.520" end="00:38:21.550" style="s2">which one way in which we bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.840" end="00:38:25.840" style="s2">ourselves he calls it the deep Adeeb</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.550" end="00:38:29.320" style="s2">Adeeb Adeeb ok so people do this they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.840" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">say they&#39;ll say things like love is only</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:37.420" style="s2">and you everybody says this and all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:39.070" style="s2">very profound and you take another drink</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.420" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">of your alcohol or whatever all right</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.070" end="00:38:46.150" style="s2">now notice what&#39;s going on here on one</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:48.040" style="s2">level this is a triviality of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.150" end="00:38:49.450" style="s2">love is a four-letter word I&#39;ve got many</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.040" end="00:38:51.100" style="s2">different independent memory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.450" end="00:38:53.380" style="s2">different uses everybody is using the</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.190" end="00:41:09.150" style="s2">and controversial and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.630" end="00:41:12.270" style="s2">criticize you withdraw no I was just</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.150" end="00:41:15.270" style="s2">saying this it looks like I&#39;m doing but</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.270" end="00:41:16.680" style="s2">no justice but then I pretend that I</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:28.200" style="s2">we can abuse this machinery and bullshit</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:42.900" style="s2">this is abuse that right the DPD is an</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.280" end="00:41:54.270" style="s2">reality we can put this all together</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.990" end="00:41:57.030" style="s2">into a normative account of what good</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.270" end="00:42:05.400" style="s2">plausibility is we have high convergence</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.400" end="00:42:08.490" style="s2">little bit later when we do some more</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.540" end="00:42:10.650" style="s2">cardio science we want something more</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.490" end="00:42:12.330" style="s2">about this in terms of relevance</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.330" end="00:42:16.590" style="s2">come back to that but when I get a</p>

<p begin="00:42:16.590" end="00:42:21.300" style="s2">convergence and elegance then I get</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.890" end="00:42:26.220" style="s2">something that&#39;s highly plausible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.300" end="00:42:30.530" style="s2">making a construct that is trustworthy</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.020" end="00:42:38.970" style="s2">this is how I make integrative new</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.970" end="00:42:42.330" style="s2">and so this is what you&#39;re trying to do</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.250" end="00:47:55.030" style="s2">meaning or we simply sense it or find it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.580" end="00:47:57.530" style="s2">in the world okay I want to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.030" end="00:47:59.870" style="s2">the cognitive science of this I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.530" end="00:48:04.910" style="s2">take a look at right the science of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.870" end="00:48:07.370" style="s2">cognition and I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.910" end="00:48:12.380" style="s2">exemplify what I showed you what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.370" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">argued for I want to try and exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.380" end="00:48:25.430" style="s2">synoptic integration and the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:27.770" style="s2">a plausible construct so the faculty in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.430" end="00:48:31.990" style="s2">us that is supposed to be our core</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.770" end="00:48:36.250" style="s2">cognitive capacity or core capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.990" end="00:48:38.930" style="s2">meaning cultivation and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.250" end="00:48:43.460" style="s2">adaptively respond to the world and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.930" end="00:48:45.290" style="s2">goes all the way back right to the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:50.300" style="s2">heritage this is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.290" end="00:48:53.420" style="s2">intelligence intelligence is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.300" end="00:48:58.490" style="s2">capacity that makes you a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.420" end="00:49:01.420" style="s2">agent at least an agent whose cognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.490" end="00:49:04.850" style="s2">is working with meaning as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.420" end="00:49:07.400" style="s2">living thing right that is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.850" end="00:49:08.810" style="s2">like a plant responding maybe in a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.400" end="00:49:10.700" style="s2">sophisticated fashion but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.810" end="00:49:13.010" style="s2">responding in this complex fashion to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.700" end="00:49:17.500" style="s2">its environment intelligence means you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.010" end="00:49:17.500" style="s2">are in some sense a cognitive agent</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.640" end="00:49:27.130" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">what is it that we should how should we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.640" end="00:49:43.560" style="s2">frame this we&#39;re gonna try and get a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:46.140" style="s2">purchase on this right so a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.560" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">trying to understand this is the way we</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.140" end="00:49:55.830" style="s2">try to test for intelligence is being a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:59.060" style="s2">general problem solver and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.830" end="00:50:01.710" style="s2">back both within the psychometric to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.060" end="00:50:04.590" style="s2">people like banan&#39;s simon who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.710" end="00:50:06.780" style="s2">to measure intelligence and people like</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.590" end="00:50:11.570" style="s2">newell and simon to different people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.780" end="00:50:14.490" style="s2">whether way that are trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.570" end="00:50:16.680" style="s2">artificial intelligence make the</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.570" end="00:50:24.270" style="s2">right not fake intelligence right both</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.350" end="00:50:26.630" style="s2">of them point to this idea that when</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.270" end="00:50:29.430" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to measure or make</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.630" end="00:50:30.930" style="s2">intelligence we&#39;re trying to measure you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.430" end="00:50:32.940" style="s2">as a general problem solver or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.930" end="00:50:34.290" style="s2">trying to make a machine that is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.940" end="00:50:36.680" style="s2">general problem solver now what does</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.290" end="00:50:40.470" style="s2">that mean okay so here&#39;s a machine</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.680" end="00:50:42.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not a general problem solver this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.470" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">is good for solving this problem holding</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.510" end="00:50:47.670" style="s2">water and we&#39;ve talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">such a way that I can use it it solves a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.670" end="00:50:49.910" style="s2">bunch of other problems maybe but not</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:54.390" style="s2">very many</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.910" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">not very many it&#39;s very limited in its</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.390" end="00:51:05.000" style="s2">problem-solving capacity right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:09.900" style="s2">unlike that cup you are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.000" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">solving a wide variety of problems in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:14.610" style="s2">wide variety of domains you are a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">general problem solver you can worry</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.610" end="00:51:20.310" style="s2">about God and how to get a drink how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">go swimming right how to build a</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.310" end="00:51:26.700" style="s2">houseboat the number of domains in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:28.590" style="s2">you can operate is vast and within each</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.700" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">one of those domains there are many</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.590" end="00:51:32.420" style="s2">different kinds of problems you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:34.470" style="s2">solve you are a general problem solver</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.420" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s why when we measure</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.470" end="00:51:38.580" style="s2">intelligence we give you a wide variety</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:40.620" style="s2">of different kinds of tests to see if</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.580" end="00:51:42.570" style="s2">you can solve a wide variety of problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.620" end="00:51:44.070" style="s2">across multiple domains that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.570" end="00:51:45.960" style="s2">test to see if you&#39;re a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.070" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">solver and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.960" end="00:51:51.329" style="s2">Newell and Simon were exactly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:53.099" style="s2">make they in fact called it we can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.329" end="00:51:55.079" style="s2">this term now because it now means</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.099" end="00:51:57.030" style="s2">global positioning but they called it</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.079" end="00:51:58.740" style="s2">the GPS the general problem solver the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.030" end="00:52:01.260" style="s2">first project to make artificial</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.740" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">intelligence not just computational</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.260" end="00:52:04.680" style="s2">machines but artificial intelligence was</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:06.510" style="s2">the right this project of trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.680" end="00:52:11.460" style="s2">the general problem solver okay so</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.510" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">you&#39;re a general problem solver okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.460" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">that makes sense right now what I need</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:22.500" style="s2">to do is a couple things to be I got to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:24.480" style="s2">be very careful here all right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.500" end="00:52:26.190" style="s2">because people get very of course this</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:29.809" style="s2">is well we&#39;ll come back to that this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.190" end="00:52:36.210" style="s2">such a a politically Laden term</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.809" end="00:52:37.829" style="s2">precisely because we we aren&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.210" end="00:52:40.440" style="s2">about what we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.829" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">equivocating all over the place and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.440" end="00:52:45.030" style="s2">we&#39;re ignorant of how this term is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:47.790" style="s2">applied to different levels of reality</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.030" end="00:52:49.650" style="s2">and yet nevertheless we will shut</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.790" end="00:52:51.990" style="s2">ourselves by finding it salient and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.650" end="00:52:56.250" style="s2">rushing into speech and action without</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.990" end="00:52:59.030" style="s2">the clarity that is needed we&#39;ll see for</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.250" end="00:53:04.280" style="s2">example that this is not a synonym for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.030" end="00:53:06.750" style="s2">being rational being intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.280" end="00:53:08.760" style="s2">what you ultimately should care about is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.750" end="00:53:15.569" style="s2">not how intelligent you are but how</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.760" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">rational you can become so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.569" end="00:53:21.569" style="s2">care here we&#39;re meaning some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:23.130" style="s2">you have for solving your problems in</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.569" end="00:53:28.710" style="s2">learning and so we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.130" end="00:53:30.930" style="s2">intelligence separate from knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.710" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">course having knowledge enables you to</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.930" end="00:53:35.970" style="s2">do things right and in that sense in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:37.410" style="s2">broad sense of adaptivity it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.970" end="00:53:40.170" style="s2">more adaptive to your environment you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.410" end="00:53:42.030" style="s2">can do lots of things even if those</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.170" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">things are make claims that other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.030" end="00:53:49.730" style="s2">value for their truth but if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:54.390" style="s2">think of the if you make these</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.730" end="00:53:56.309" style="s2">synonymous then you can&#39;t use this to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.390" end="00:53:58.440" style="s2">explain this you can&#39;t say the reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.309" end="00:53:59.579" style="s2">why susan was able to acquire such</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.440" end="00:54:01.349" style="s2">knowledge is we</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.579" end="00:54:03.239" style="s2">she&#39;s intelligence because if</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.349" end="00:54:05.099" style="s2">intelligent means possessing knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.239" end="00:54:06.779" style="s2">then you all you&#39;re saying is Susan</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.099" end="00:54:09.059" style="s2">possesses knowledge because Susan</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.779" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">possesses knowledge which is non</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.059" end="00:54:19.349" style="s2">explanatory right so what we want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:22.859" style="s2">is what is it to solve a problem don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.349" end="00:54:26.670" style="s2">focus on the product having the answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.859" end="00:54:29.279" style="s2">getting the knowledge I focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.670" end="00:54:30.539" style="s2">process that process and this is going</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.279" end="00:54:32.459" style="s2">to be a hallmark we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.539" end="00:54:34.709" style="s2">before the hallmark of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.459" end="00:54:37.619" style="s2">valuing the process not just being</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.709" end="00:54:43.499" style="s2">fixated on the product especially the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.619" end="00:54:45.690" style="s2">belief the conclusion right so what we</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.499" end="00:54:47.279" style="s2">got to analyze the process what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.690" end="00:54:50.519" style="s2">solve a problem and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.279" end="00:54:52.229" style="s2">work of Newell and Simon was just so</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.519" end="00:54:56.420" style="s2">deeply influential it&#39;s been influential</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.229" end="00:54:59.069" style="s2">in psychology computer science economics</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.420" end="00:55:01.410" style="s2">it&#39;s just seminal and important work</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.069" end="00:55:05.069" style="s2">now as I first try to describe it to you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.410" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to strike you as you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.069" end="00:55:10.529" style="s2">somewhat trivial but let&#39;s go let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:14.789" style="s2">very carefully on what we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.529" end="00:55:17.039" style="s2">right we&#39;re going to try and analyze a</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.789" end="00:55:20.789" style="s2">problem down into four basic features</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.039" end="00:55:23.579" style="s2">and we&#39;ll end today&#39;s episode with that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.789" end="00:55:26.369" style="s2">and at that point it won&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.579" end="00:55:28.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve got that profound construct that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.369" end="00:55:32.449" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for and then I&#39;ll need you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.890" end="00:55:35.789" style="s2">to wait to next time</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.449" end="00:55:37.499" style="s2">but Newell and Simon basically said what</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.789" end="00:55:39.390" style="s2">what is it to have a problem a problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.499" end="00:55:40.709" style="s2">is when there&#39;s a difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.390" end="00:55:42.959" style="s2">state you&#39;re in which they called your</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.709" end="00:55:46.289" style="s2">initial state and the state you want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.959" end="00:55:48.239" style="s2">be and this is your goal state so I have</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.289" end="00:55:49.440" style="s2">a problem when there&#39;s a significant</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.239" end="00:55:52.499" style="s2">difference between those for example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.440" end="00:55:54.029" style="s2">thirsty right and I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.499" end="00:55:55.949" style="s2">thirsty since those aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.029" end="00:55:58.920" style="s2">thing I things have to change in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.949" end="00:55:59.999" style="s2">world and in me but the difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.920" end="00:56:02.430" style="s2">between the initial state and the goal</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.999" end="00:56:05.190" style="s2">state to go away so part of what I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.430" end="00:56:07.799" style="s2">to do when I solve a problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.190" end="00:56:09.059" style="s2">system has to be able to represent will</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.799" end="00:56:11.130" style="s2">have to come back to how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.059" end="00:56:13.310" style="s2">use that term the initial state and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.130" end="00:56:16.820" style="s2">goal state and then the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.310" end="00:56:18.620" style="s2">our actions operations I can perform</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.820" end="00:56:20.780" style="s2">that will change the state I&#39;m initially</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.620" end="00:56:23.450" style="s2">into some other state so for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.780" end="00:56:25.250" style="s2">part of the problem I had was I&#39;m over</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.450" end="00:56:26.690" style="s2">here and the glasses over here so one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.250" end="00:56:28.090" style="s2">the things I can do one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.690" end="00:56:30.980" style="s2">can do is I can walk towards the glass</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.090" end="00:56:32.510" style="s2">right the cop right of course another</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.980" end="00:56:34.070" style="s2">thing I can do is I can raise my hand</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.510" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">now you say well don&#39;t raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.070" end="00:56:36.500" style="s2">that&#39;s stupid</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.540" style="s2">well wait there&#39;s going to become a</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.500" end="00:56:40.600" style="s2">point though when I do need to raise my</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.540" end="00:56:43.880" style="s2">hand so I&#39;m gonna need that operation</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.600" end="00:56:48.260" style="s2">okay so I think you&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.880" end="00:56:50.690" style="s2">things and then what I do is from here</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.260" end="00:56:54.590" style="s2">perhaps I can do two other operations</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.690" end="00:56:56.630" style="s2">right from a trim here maybe three from</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.590" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">here maybe only one and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.630" end="00:57:14.060" style="s2">forth right I&#39;m not gonna draw it all</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:16.040" style="s2">out right so so far I&#39;ve got right three</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.060" end="00:57:17.990" style="s2">things that I&#39;m analyzing a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.040" end="00:57:20.900" style="s2">problem-solving I&#39;m analyzing problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.990" end="00:57:23.420" style="s2">solving in two initial State a goal</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.900" end="00:57:26.600" style="s2">state and operators that can transform</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.420" end="00:57:28.520" style="s2">one state into another state there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.600" end="00:57:36.080" style="s2">other thing I have I have what are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.520" end="00:57:38.180" style="s2">called path constraints you see I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.080" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">general problem solver I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.180" end="00:57:45.140" style="s2">find just any solution one of the ways I</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:47.620" style="s2">can make lunch for myself is to burn</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.140" end="00:57:52.070" style="s2">down my house it will cook my food that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.620" end="00:57:53.570" style="s2">is not a good solution not because it</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.070" end="00:57:55.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t achieve the goal I want in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.570" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">situation of cooking my food but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.850" end="00:57:59.510" style="s2">really reduces me as a general problem</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.510" end="00:58:04.340" style="s2">problem to the detriment of my ability</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">to solve multiple other problems or I</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.340" end="00:58:10.100" style="s2">will lose my intelligence I will lose my</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:13.250" style="s2">capacity as a general problem solver so</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.100" end="00:58:16.700" style="s2">what I have to do is the following</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.250" end="00:58:19.820" style="s2">solving a problem is this it&#39;s to have a</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.589" end="00:58:31.509" style="s2">constraints preserving me as a general</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.869" end="00:58:38.109" style="s2">problem solver that&#39;s what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.509" end="00:58:40.059" style="s2">solve a problem and this this is called</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.109" end="00:58:46.119" style="s2">the problem space or sometimes called</p>
