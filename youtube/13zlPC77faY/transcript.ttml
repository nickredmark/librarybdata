<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">but the topic serves as an anchor for</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">each game so the two players</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">use that as a starting point</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">to explore their own perspective</p>

<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">there&#39;s only one rule really which is to</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">turns</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">but there are ideals to the game</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">the first ideal is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">we avoid the use of i</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">and you to bypass the ego</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">enter into the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">and tap into the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">we also try to intertwine</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">our moves as much as possible with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">other players moves</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">to try and create as many points of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">interconnection</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">by paying close attention to the other</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">and nourishing the other player with our</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">so they feel listened to and they feel</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">and finally we try and concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">as much of our truth as much of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">into each of our moves</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">if you by accident use i or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">which is very common don&#39;t worry about</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">try and speak faster than you can think</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">let yourself be surprised by the truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">which is inside of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">which you never thought was there</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">the great temptation of the game</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">is to start thinking about what you are</p>
