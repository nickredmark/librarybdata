<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">a whole lot of issues which are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">closely related that I&#39;m going to</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">disagreement with a lot of the content</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">but the the thinking on the topics is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:53.909" style="s2">a really good at least point of of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">address to say that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.909" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">problems that I have are generally what</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">I would call the the style of contents</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">of the recordings that I made talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">how to frame the substance that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.360" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">Greenhalgh is yeah I so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:35.590" style="s2">sort of address this issue yeah so I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:41.460" style="s2">guess to use some of maybe the language</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.590" end="00:02:46.150" style="s2">in in the that I don&#39;t like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.460" end="00:02:49.590" style="s2">conclusions in in sort of the opinions</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:53.110" style="s2">expressed and such but I mean you know a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">lot of you know let me just get into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.110" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">issues specifically I guess so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s so much to comment on they</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">bring up Joe Rogan as being a kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:20.020" style="s2">mean I do I don&#39;t have disagreements of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.420" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">fact with a lot of what is said here you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.020" end="00:03:25.930" style="s2">know and and it&#39;s true that people like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">Joe Rogan are almost like a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.930" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">nexus between high culture and low</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.810" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">culture and Joe Rogan is something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.630" end="00:03:50.710" style="s2">a very important aspect of the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.260" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">emergent media and you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.710" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">there is a lot of obvious value in what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:07.540" style="s2">Joe Rogan does functionally for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">could say the evolution of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">such yeah this is perhaps not not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.400" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">best thing to start with here</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:30.130" style="s2">I very critical of Joe Rogan&#39;s yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:32.650" style="s2">see I don&#39;t like talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.130" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">things because they come out very harsh</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.650" end="00:04:43.780" style="s2">like a lot of my opinion and comment</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">here is is is overly harsh and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.780" end="00:04:48.460" style="s2">important the points that I make are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">very important and that makes it even</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.460" end="00:04:55.540" style="s2">harsher but there is a difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:58.300" style="s2">between the kind of the meta discussion</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.540" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">of the issues that are important and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.300" end="00:05:02.290" style="s2">let&#39;s just say the facts on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">and how they present themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.290" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">these are our separate arenas so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:15.760" style="s2">say the criticism that I have with Joe</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:18.340" style="s2">Rogan if you were to take on board that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.760" end="00:05:26.290" style="s2">criticism he would probably be much less</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.340" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">popular and that would be that would not</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.290" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">be helpful in some sense so I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:35.650" style="s2">in as much as that girag in&#39; is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:37.960" style="s2">essentially a platform in which he can</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.650" end="00:05:44.430" style="s2">interact with many different voices many</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.960" end="00:05:44.430" style="s2">different ideas come across his</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.270" end="00:05:55.150" style="s2">his band width of broadcasting which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.910" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">quite broad you know he reached as many</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.150" end="00:06:01.300" style="s2">people so that reach would would not be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.860" style="s2">possible and so but I mean in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.300" end="00:06:05.920" style="s2">I think you could make the case that Joe</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.860" end="00:06:08.860" style="s2">Rogan in terms of style is somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.920" end="00:06:11.260" style="s2">what is sometimes referred to as legacy</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.860" end="00:06:14.380" style="s2">media that he is almost like them the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.260" end="00:06:18.850" style="s2">closest thing to legacy media in the new</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.380" end="00:06:20.470" style="s2">media in some sense and obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.850" end="00:06:23.290" style="s2">has nothing to do with the people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.470" end="00:06:26.140" style="s2">he gives a platform to it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.290" end="00:06:30.550" style="s2">I&#39;m just talking about almost him as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.140" end="00:06:33.850" style="s2">individual and his how he assesses</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.550" end="00:06:37.720" style="s2">things and and such and I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.850" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">really has to do with his temperament is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.720" end="00:06:42.370" style="s2">almost intellectual temperament</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.610" end="00:06:44.650" style="s2">personality style and such and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.370" end="00:06:48.910" style="s2">it&#39;s always it&#39;s not nice talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.650" end="00:06:50.410" style="s2">these things because people have</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.910" end="00:06:53.530" style="s2">different personalities people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.410" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">different in terms of how they perceive</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.530" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">and judge the world and it&#39;s not nice to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">talk about their limitations which are I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:05.890" style="s2">don&#39;t think any of these limitations</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:09.580" style="s2">that I levy against people are in any</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.890" end="00:07:12.130" style="s2">way innate but there are such heavy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.580" end="00:07:15.270" style="s2">ingrained patterns that develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.130" end="00:07:19.240" style="s2">character in a person&#39;s character</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:20.470" style="s2">through a process of you know there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.240" end="00:07:23.230" style="s2">least some level of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.470" end="00:07:24.940" style="s2">innovation individuation which obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.230" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">is why very young children are</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.940" end="00:07:31.830" style="s2">especially intelligent because they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:36.310" style="s2">making decisions that are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.830" end="00:07:44.530" style="s2">framing their psyche and and how those</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.310" end="00:07:47.400" style="s2">things are structured lay the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.530" end="00:07:49.570" style="s2">boundaries for future networks of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.400" end="00:07:53.230" style="s2">possible decisions and possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.570" end="00:07:55.600" style="s2">judgements and perceptions and yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.230" end="00:07:59.160" style="s2">mean there are lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.600" end="00:08:01.230" style="s2">theories in terms of personality theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.160" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">all of the good ones essentially are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.230" end="00:08:08.520" style="s2">academically viable because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:12.690" style="s2">really justify them academically because</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.520" end="00:08:15.810" style="s2">they&#39;re there&#39;s no there&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.690" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">enough philosophical argument for how</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.810" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">you you would have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">meaningfully discriminate between</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:32.370" style="s2">different styles of cognition or mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:36.410" style="s2">objects or these things are by their</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:40.200" style="s2">very nature incredibly theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.410" end="00:08:45.150" style="s2">psychology is is probably the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.200" end="00:08:49.290" style="s2">blemish that we have in the respected</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.150" end="00:08:51.870" style="s2">world of academia or I mean I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.290" end="00:08:55.370" style="s2">that kind of the societal authority that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.870" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">is given to academics the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.370" end="00:09:01.280" style="s2">psychological sophistication and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:09.720" style="s2">impoverishment of it anyway to to just</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.280" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">focus on on this context so I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:16.340" style="s2">is a lot of that can be flung in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">every direction I I must say I have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.340" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">lot of reservation about Jordan green</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:28.170" style="s2">holes contributions which I could hash</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">out I don&#39;t know if I don&#39;t think I did</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.170" end="00:09:39.270" style="s2">I blow these things because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:41.580" style="s2">somewhat like since I need to lay down a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.270" end="00:09:43.860" style="s2">broader thing about why it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.580" end="00:09:46.530" style="s2">to do so because it definitely feels</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.860" end="00:09:50.460" style="s2">unfair without a proper context of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.530" end="00:09:53.280" style="s2">talking about psychology but there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.460" end="00:09:56.130" style="s2">two ways of let&#39;s say understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.280" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">world and I&#39;m going to talk very roughly</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.130" end="00:10:02.940" style="s2">because they&#39;re depending on how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">bring up subjects and how let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.940" end="00:10:11.430" style="s2">reduce them there are there are pitfalls</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:12.870" style="s2">there are very obvious traps which I see</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.430" end="00:10:17.400" style="s2">people falling into</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.870" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">and this is the problem is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.400" end="00:10:24.300" style="s2">people just almost want to fit into some</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:27.420" style="s2">kind of patent framework that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">IDW is roughly sketching out and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.420" end="00:10:34.170" style="s2">just want to kind of find some some</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.850" style="s2">important dicta that they can live</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.170" end="00:10:38.310" style="s2">within that outline they can operate</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">without that outline without someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.310" end="00:10:43.490" style="s2">like me creeping up in the shadows and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:46.410" style="s2">sort of fashion them over their head and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.490" end="00:10:53.730" style="s2">and and living things against them in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">nasty way and this is a problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.730" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">that if you try to extract dicta like</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:11:06.780" style="s2">that you&#39;ve lost the real space and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:09.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of already conceded it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.780" end="00:11:11.790" style="s2">just kind of be taken over by what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.300" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">essentially a kind of vague consensus of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.790" end="00:11:17.850" style="s2">some kind of horrible morality which I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:22.230" style="s2">even heard some descriptions of in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.850" end="00:11:27.210" style="s2">content of this particular video just in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.230" end="00:11:31.500" style="s2">terms of yeah now what I&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.210" end="00:11:33.570" style="s2">I can I can illustrate my point slightly</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.500" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">but what I think is missing from this</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.570" end="00:11:40.020" style="s2">discussion is let&#39;s say purchase on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:41.700" style="s2">core belief system that kind of grounds</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.020" end="00:11:42.960" style="s2">the IDW and I think people even said</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.700" end="00:11:45.510" style="s2">well you know we&#39;re not trying to be the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.960" end="00:11:47.610" style="s2">IDW so we don&#39;t need to sort of have our</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.510" end="00:11:49.170" style="s2">feet on the ground in that way we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.610" end="00:11:51.810" style="s2">actually want to live within a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.170" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">framework and or an outline and do some</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.810" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">thinking of our own let&#39;s just say and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.380" end="00:12:03.780" style="s2">yeah a lot of this this kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">loose consensus I&#39;m going to say I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.780" end="00:12:15.570" style="s2">I see it building basically out of some</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:17.840" style="s2">flaws that I see in the the thought of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.570" end="00:12:19.810" style="s2">Jordan Greenhalgh which were almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.840" end="00:12:23.980" style="s2">stylistic floors</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.810" end="00:12:25.570" style="s2">I can describe this in a few different</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.980" end="00:12:28.930" style="s2">ways but I do want to give a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.570" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">broader context but let me just go back</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">to making the illustration that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.910" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">to make you know creating an atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:41.740" style="s2">of good behavior and creating venues in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.920" style="s2">which this honest thinking can you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.740" end="00:12:50.440" style="s2">it can sort of happen in a nice way</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.920" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">I mean my ex--you is completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.440" end="00:12:55.420" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">I see the having an having an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.420" end="00:13:01.000" style="s2">culture is is much stronger than that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:04.150" style="s2">and much more important than all of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.000" end="00:13:18.580" style="s2">so I mean the only let&#39;s say thing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.150" end="00:13:21.430" style="s2">I would the the curatorship of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.580" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">content set as section something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.430" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">that I mean this doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">cuz my youtube channel is is you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.230" end="00:13:37.330" style="s2">practically dead but the the the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:40.930" style="s2">thing I would ever consider editing out</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.330" end="00:13:43.810" style="s2">of content sorry out of comment sections</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.930" end="00:13:46.570" style="s2">would be spam like literally spam that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.810" end="00:13:48.430" style="s2">you could not actually see what people</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.570" end="00:13:50.290" style="s2">were thinking or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.430" end="00:13:52.900" style="s2">don&#39;t need the repetition of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.290" end="00:13:55.030" style="s2">so if something was literally inane and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.900" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">spam I think you can obviously make a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.030" end="00:14:03.459" style="s2">case for removing that but if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:07.770" style="s2">making nasty maybe making a good points</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.459" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">in a nasty way I think I think you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.770" end="00:14:11.830" style="s2">intellectual honesty can deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:14.740" style="s2">I think you can make relate an</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.830" end="00:14:17.709" style="s2">intellectual response you you can and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.740" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">then rebuke the person style you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.709" end="00:14:22.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t see a problem I think you should</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:26.080" style="s2">be able to contend with these things I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.990" end="00:14:28.470" style="s2">don&#39;t think I mean essentially when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.080" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">are kind of editing a sorry</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:33.150" style="s2">when you&#39;re removing people&#39;s comments</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:35.190" style="s2">because you don&#39;t like the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.150" end="00:14:40.650" style="s2">cultural vibe that they&#39;re creating I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.190" end="00:14:43.410" style="s2">mean that just sounds like you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.650" end="00:14:46.380" style="s2">mean obviously I&#39;m of a different</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.410" end="00:14:48.090" style="s2">opinion that you know the that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.380" end="00:14:50.730" style="s2">trying to promote a culture and we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.090" end="00:14:52.950" style="s2">to do that by basically creating an</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.730" end="00:14:54.780" style="s2">atmosphere and someone&#39;s saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.950" end="00:15:00.060" style="s2">this is my house or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.780" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">I mean ya recoiled from a lot of of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:19.950" style="s2">kind of to me that that is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">admission of a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.950" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">cowardice but also lacking the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.030" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">lacking a sort of a good faith in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.070" end="00:15:41.260" style="s2">kind of the mind of the individual but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">this is perhaps better exemplified from</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.260" end="00:15:46.690" style="s2">a completely different example I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:48.820" style="s2">say that yes there are people out there</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.690" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">who are going to read the comment as</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.820" end="00:15:53.820" style="s2">they read the first comments as they</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:56.230" style="s2">were listening to a video before they</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.820" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">respond to the video and that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.230" end="00:16:00.670" style="s2">like that contextualizes the content</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">already and that will contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.670" end="00:16:08.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say your response to it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:10.300" style="s2">might see a comment but actually very</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.590" end="00:16:18.370" style="s2">often but this might also just because</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.300" end="00:16:22.330" style="s2">of be how I how my screen is set up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.370" end="00:16:24.790" style="s2">I you know in terms of the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.330" end="00:16:27.550" style="s2">of the YouTube panel or where the video</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.790" end="00:16:30.670" style="s2">is viewing I will not be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.550" end="00:16:33.940" style="s2">the comments until I have my own formed</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.670" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">opinion I like so after I have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.940" end="00:16:36.370" style="s2">opinion</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.260" style="s2">then I&#39;ll maybe consider the comments to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.370" end="00:16:39.670" style="s2">work out if someone has ready let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.260" end="00:16:42.250" style="s2">dealt with the thing that I found</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.670" end="00:16:44.650" style="s2">offensive and then I can sort of add my</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.250" end="00:16:47.170" style="s2">two cents or chimed in something or</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.650" end="00:16:50.980" style="s2">modify something that has already been</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.170" end="00:16:54.790" style="s2">pointed out or make my own contribution</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.980" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">you know so I would say perhaps I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.790" end="00:16:59.320" style="s2">very different class and and in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:03.010" style="s2">sense I am in a very different class of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.320" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">curator or consumer of this new media</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.010" end="00:17:06.610" style="s2">because essentially I do consider myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:12.819" style="s2">as being part of the intellectual dog</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.610" end="00:17:14.500" style="s2">with and I don&#39;t think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.819" end="00:17:19.390" style="s2">price of entry of that is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.500" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">high there cultural references to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.390" end="00:17:26.140" style="s2">that horrible pop music not horrible I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">mean actually stylistically I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.140" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">call it horrible but the content of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:34.060" style="s2">particular song you know will never be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:36.390" style="s2">Royals you know this is what I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.060" end="00:17:36.390" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.649" end="00:17:47.029" style="s2">trying trying to make his face for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.120" end="00:18:01.140" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of content that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:04.140" style="s2">need to cover but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.140" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">anything like the death of the author in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.140" end="00:18:14.669" style="s2">in this new sense I mean I I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:18.570" style="s2">is a very that again comes from tracking</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.669" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">a kind of the form of what patterns seem</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.570" end="00:18:23.789" style="s2">to be happening at a kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:26.460" style="s2">third pot third-person perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.789" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with this new culture or</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.460" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">new media you have to have a very kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:37.950" style="s2">of okay yeah this is good summation I</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">think of the problem happening here is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.950" end="00:18:44.149" style="s2">that you should not address people as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:47.490" style="s2">kind of group now that like human beings</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.149" end="00:18:50.399" style="s2">the whole perspective of like this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.490" end="00:18:52.919" style="s2">happening to human beings plural group</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.399" end="00:18:54.600" style="s2">this is happening to group noun and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.919" end="00:18:56.549" style="s2">are members of a group now and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.600" end="00:18:57.690" style="s2">the wrong way to conceive of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.549" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">things and you&#39;re going to get yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.690" end="00:19:02.070" style="s2">into a lot of trouble because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">actually completely circumvent what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.070" end="00:19:07.500" style="s2">really going on because and and I do</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.660" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">yeah so I mean saying that like the</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.730" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">know I I would say that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:16.460" style="s2">the author is lost in in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:18.380" style="s2">greater saga of forces I think that only</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.460" end="00:20:21.130" style="s2">that literally only happens in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.380" end="00:20:24.860" style="s2">of the audience that has already adopted</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.430" end="00:20:37.040" style="s2">there are some beliefs that almost they</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.530" end="00:20:45.800" style="s2">have a kind of there&#39;s almost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.040" end="00:20:51.470" style="s2">dial ism in in something some of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.800" end="00:20:54.500" style="s2">thinking I don&#39;t almost feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.470" end="00:20:57.470" style="s2">wanting to catalog the problems but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.500" end="00:20:58.820" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve probably made enough insulting</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.470" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">remarks that I should probably try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.820" end="00:21:07.850" style="s2">substantiate them fully so at least they</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">could be seen as more potentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.850" end="00:21:13.730" style="s2">helpful and and this this comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">point as well that if you are interested</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.620" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to think of a nice way</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:22.710" style="s2">to kind of describe it I can only think</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">of analogies right now it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.710" end="00:22:29.220" style="s2">you know we need security we need safety</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">you know we need some room to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.220" end="00:22:33.900" style="s2">you know we and and I I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:37.580" style="s2">that is an important grander point which</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.900" end="00:22:41.250" style="s2">can be served by something we do need</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.580" end="00:22:44.070" style="s2">but I would call I don&#39;t know if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.250" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">else has has used this phrase I feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:51.270" style="s2">like I must have stolen it from someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2">but we need slow spaces in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.270" end="00:23:00.120" style="s2">get a hold of our own thinking and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:23:02.760" style="s2">room is important but I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.120" end="00:23:06.690" style="s2">the price of admission to that is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.760" end="00:23:08.430" style="s2">sort of it has to be vulnerability of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.690" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">vulnerability and a kind of human</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.430" end="00:23:13.380" style="s2">intellectual humility of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:16.620" style="s2">take on things which are perhaps very</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.380" end="00:23:20.160" style="s2">devastating and the idea that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.620" end="00:23:30.420" style="s2">sort of going to don&#39;t be rude in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.160" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">house I mean yeah look you see it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.420" end="00:23:34.890" style="s2">hot you can&#39;t critique things blankly</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.270" style="s2">because obviously that would there would</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.890" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">be a context in which that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.270" end="00:23:41.930" style="s2">appropriate you know if someone is being</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:44.070" style="s2">rude and there isn&#39;t let&#39;s just say an</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.930" end="00:23:47.370" style="s2">intellectual challenge in what they say</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.070" end="00:23:50.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s merely just almost spam I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.370" end="00:23:52.920" style="s2">say that that is worth disdaining and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.360" end="00:23:54.360" style="s2">removing from your sort of environment</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.920" end="00:23:56.700" style="s2">because it&#39;s literally just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.360" end="00:23:59.220" style="s2">trying to slow things down but there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.700" end="00:24:01.080" style="s2">things that are not merely trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.220" end="00:24:07.410" style="s2">slow things down you could say that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.080" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">are they are trying to wreak fatal fatal</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.410" end="00:24:12.750" style="s2">devastation and I think we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:16.140" style="s2">permissive and open to this because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.750" end="00:24:20.100" style="s2">either have to refute or contest or find</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.140" end="00:24:23.150" style="s2">some perhaps that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.100" end="00:24:23.150" style="s2">potential value in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.160" end="00:24:30.520" style="s2">at least in in in developing a rebuke or</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.640" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">an immunity to such let&#39;s say an</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.520" end="00:24:39.130" style="s2">intellectual assault and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:40.660" style="s2">obviously we cannot actually know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.130" end="00:24:44.530" style="s2">perhaps this is not so illegitimate to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.660" end="00:24:46.690" style="s2">expect of people that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.530" end="00:24:52.600" style="s2">people should be shielded from views</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.690" end="00:24:59.550" style="s2">that are would require one to completely</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.600" end="00:24:59.550" style="s2">dismantle oneself and re re redevelop</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.800" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">yeah to cut out a whole section of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.170" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">discourse simply because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:25.090" style="s2">gratifying to to sort of to pass PA rse</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">I always wish I could say that word I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.090" end="00:25:31.410" style="s2">could say that work without having to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:31.410" style="s2">spell it because it&#39;s a homophone but</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.170" end="00:25:42.220" style="s2">that&#39;s you know I would say that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.850" end="00:25:44.590" style="s2">of these things are happening yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.220" end="00:25:48.570" style="s2">need to talk about psychology more in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.590" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">details so the thing is is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:56.170" style="s2">psychology has its own parameters it has</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:58.630" style="s2">its own that I mean psychology proper as</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.170" end="00:26:03.720" style="s2">an obviously psychology that I refer to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.630" end="00:26:03.720" style="s2">in a sense is not popular</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.809" end="00:26:12.679" style="s2">yeah I mean it would probably do much</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.490" end="00:26:15.080" style="s2">better if I would write a book about my</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.679" end="00:26:18.460" style="s2">ideas before trying to sort of inject</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.080" end="00:26:18.460" style="s2">them into the public sphere but</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.669" end="00:26:35.710" style="s2">yeah so was it basically what gives way</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:37.899" style="s2">to death of the author and notions like</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.710" end="00:26:40.090" style="s2">that is let&#39;s just say psycho</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.899" end="00:26:41.889" style="s2">psychological politics in its proper</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.090" end="00:26:44.379" style="s2">place and understanding that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.889" end="00:26:45.909" style="s2">whole field of psychological politics</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.379" end="00:26:51.220" style="s2">and this was perhaps even what was being</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.909" end="00:26:54.629" style="s2">slightly explored when this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.220" end="00:26:54.629" style="s2">was talking about comedy</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.270" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">the the problem I would say with its use</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.899" end="00:27:25.169" style="s2">some language droolin greenhalgh is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:29.640" style="s2">presenting fragments of introverted</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.169" end="00:27:34.100" style="s2">thinking he is sharing his introverted</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.330" end="00:27:46.909" style="s2">is a very vital part of intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.830" end="00:27:53.929" style="s2">the problem with articulating fragments</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.539" end="00:27:56.130" style="s2">of introverted thinking is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.929" end="00:27:58.230" style="s2">introverted thinking is so vital to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.130" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">intellectual life that it basically sets</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.230" end="00:28:07.980" style="s2">up orthodoxy and dogma and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:11.610" style="s2">especially sort of obvious when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.980" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">got fragments because they they will</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.610" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">sort of have their own internal</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:17.779" style="s2">coherency which will lead to more of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.179" style="s2">same you know and it kind of ends up</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.779" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">assimilating things into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.179" end="00:28:27.029" style="s2">matrix framework</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.570" end="00:28:37.700" style="s2">you cannot build it you have to take it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.330" end="00:28:39.740" style="s2">as a as an entire package and so unless</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.700" end="00:28:42.889" style="s2">you have a complete package of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.740" end="00:28:48.470" style="s2">introverted thinking it&#39;s pretty much</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.470" end="00:28:53.870" style="s2">to be able to work with introverted</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.009" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">that it will never keep up with context</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.960" end="00:29:05.179" style="s2">and so it actually has to have quite a</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.179" end="00:29:09.950" style="s2">have to kind of keep it reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.399" end="00:29:17.990" style="s2">something manageable and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.950" end="00:29:20.090" style="s2">like kind of it has to be representative</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.990" end="00:29:22.429" style="s2">of something that is quite core and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.090" end="00:29:26.200" style="s2">pivotal pivotal but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.429" end="00:29:29.929" style="s2">that is essentially quite simplistic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.200" end="00:29:31.940" style="s2">an almost blunt but almost infinite in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.929" end="00:29:34.370" style="s2">its application now this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.940" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">is when you start kind of rendering it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.370" end="00:29:40.460" style="s2">and rendering it into detail you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:42.649" style="s2">these kind of you get what seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.460" end="00:29:44.210" style="s2">very useful implements but they if you</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.210" end="00:29:57.409" style="s2">toxic influence built into them and one</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.169" end="00:29:59.750" style="s2">of the toxic effects of this is that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.409" end="00:30:06.110" style="s2">you you get sort of married into an</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.750" end="00:30:07.639" style="s2">abstracted disembodied paradigm where</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.110" end="00:30:10.879" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of looking at reality from</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.289" end="00:30:23.269" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to call a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.940" end="00:30:25.490" style="s2">component but let me not sound like like</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.269" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">a crackpot I&#39;ll just catch that out very</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.490" end="00:30:31.519" style="s2">importantly I was just thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:34.340" style="s2">phrase which hopefully the looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.519" end="00:30:36.500" style="s2">this phrase will well is illustrate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.340" end="00:30:40.639" style="s2">point the important points because this</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.500" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">goes into a core belief moving and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.639" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">understanding from a core belief rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:47.390" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:50.150" style="s2">through a kind of through some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.390" end="00:30:54.340" style="s2">aggregated pattern you know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.150" end="00:30:59.780" style="s2">just kind to try to mimic the activity</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.340" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen modeled and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.780" end="00:31:04.460" style="s2">live within some kind of moral domain</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:07.010" style="s2">that that you see instantiated within</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.460" end="00:31:09.140" style="s2">that like narratives are important but</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.010" end="00:31:13.640" style="s2">they&#39;re important as gateways to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.140" end="00:31:18.650" style="s2">say core belief almost actualization</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.640" end="00:31:20.920" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s my example so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.650" end="00:31:23.420" style="s2">phrase let me just make up this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.920" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;s so important for human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.420" end="00:31:28.730" style="s2">believe in human beings now depending on</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:31.460" style="s2">the context and the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.730" end="00:31:33.260" style="s2">intellectual context that one puts</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.460" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">emphasis on certain things and reads</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.260" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">into things with certain common sense I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.860" style="s2">can find a context in which what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:41.060" style="s2">just said is the worst thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.860" end="00:31:44.090" style="s2">world and what I&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.060" end="00:31:46.670" style="s2">is a very profound and wise thing now</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.090" end="00:31:52.790" style="s2">let me just contrast those views to try</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.670" end="00:31:55.010" style="s2">and make this point you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.790" end="00:31:56.360" style="s2">shame that human beings don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.010" end="00:31:58.910" style="s2">human beings you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.360" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">so the the idea of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.910" end="00:32:05.300" style="s2">believing in human beings now you should</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:08.030" style="s2">not believe in the group noun of human</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.300" end="00:32:11.300" style="s2">beings that simply just the collective</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.030" end="00:32:15.380" style="s2">of human beings like matter-of-factly</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.300" end="00:32:21.170" style="s2">banding together that group of humans is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.380" end="00:32:22.940" style="s2">not is not that&#39;s not going to have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.170" end="00:32:26.390" style="s2">kind of magic that it&#39;s going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.940" end="00:32:30.920" style="s2">to kind of almost you know the idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.390" end="00:32:34.550" style="s2">of a group of humans is not significance</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.920" end="00:32:37.010" style="s2">and it in fact entails no deep or</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">profound promise on anything you know it</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">cannot but to say that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:49.280" style="s2">important for human beings to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">human beings the idea that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.280" end="00:32:54.410" style="s2">within human beings is what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:55.950" style="s2">believed in like the thing that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.410" end="00:32:59.610" style="s2">say can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.950" end="00:33:02.460" style="s2">human beings the the space within human</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.610" end="00:33:05.340" style="s2">beings needs to be believed in that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.460" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">certainly true and that is you could say</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.340" end="00:33:09.210" style="s2">that that&#39;s quite hidden in the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.620" style="s2">human you know the only problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.210" end="00:33:14.100" style="s2">world is is that human beings don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.620" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">believe in human beings now if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.100" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">believe in the space within human beings</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:28.370" style="s2">right that is the let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:33.000" style="s2">articulation of choice and and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.370" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2">decisions made in an unbounded way in</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:38.760" style="s2">the exercise of free will</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:41.340" style="s2">let&#39;s say in the purpose in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.760" end="00:33:45.570" style="s2">enterprise of constructing purpose okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">now this is what is actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.570" end="00:33:49.049" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to create a community</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to curatorship</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.049" end="00:33:53.490" style="s2">it into being a good venue of good</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.590" style="s2">activity or something like that all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.490" end="00:34:00.409" style="s2">that is essentially meaningless unless</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.590" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">you qualify it with what purpose are we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.409" end="00:34:10.520" style="s2">cultivating what purpose are we trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">to to kind of get our ecosystem to to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.520" end="00:34:18.089" style="s2">crafted around you know so you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:20.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of economy of purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.089" end="00:34:21.690" style="s2">there are different types of purposes</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.010" end="00:34:24.599" style="s2">there are you know there are generative</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.690" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">purposes and they are just devastating</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.599" end="00:34:32.069" style="s2">and bankrupts purposes in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.669" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">that are just looking for more people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.069" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">go down with them you know and there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:43.649" style="s2">kind of a kind of self defeatism or to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:45.300" style="s2">some species of nihilism now in as much</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.649" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">as one isn&#39;t transparent about one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.300" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">purpose you know which is kind of quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:57.869" style="s2">obvious and in the intellectual sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.530" style="s2">manifestation of what is generally</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.869" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">regarded as skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.530" end="00:35:04.980" style="s2">you know skepticism doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:07.980" style="s2">state a purpose for you to have to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.980" end="00:35:11.609" style="s2">its accusation seriously this is where</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.980" end="00:35:13.500" style="s2">where skepticism essentially defeats</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.609" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">people because it forces people to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.500" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">into their economy of no purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">therefore it will eventually exhaust you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:24.440" style="s2">you know so I mean the the proper way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:24.440" style="s2">defeating skepticism is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.630" end="00:35:45.750" style="s2">is attacking it for not having a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.279" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">it is for making a positive claim</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.750" end="00:35:56.130" style="s2">against us now when when you that&#39;s a is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.359" end="00:35:58.619" style="s2">quite an intellectual point let let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.130" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">just say or abstract philosophical point</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.619" end="00:36:02.940" style="s2">ER when you&#39;ve got that under your belt</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:05.609" style="s2">then you&#39;re not so worried about let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.940" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">say being ravaged by trolls or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.609" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">like that and I mean I have I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:12.900" style="s2">believe intellectually I&#39;m quite robust</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:16.759" style="s2">that I don&#39;t have any real problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.900" end="00:36:19.619" style="s2">dealing with anyone and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.759" end="00:36:22.849" style="s2">sometimes I will be angry at trolls and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.619" end="00:36:26.630" style="s2">I will express genuine anger at them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.849" end="00:36:29.130" style="s2">they will take this as a technical</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.630" end="00:36:32.759" style="s2">victory on their part because they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.130" end="00:36:34.670" style="s2">gotten me to react and you know in as</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.759" end="00:36:40.200" style="s2">much as they have not expressed their</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.670" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">true intellectual position let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.200" end="00:36:47.339" style="s2">say perhaps they were just doing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">purely to sort of simulate an</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.339" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">intellectual exchange to kind of help</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:55.559" style="s2">produce a reaction but I would say in as</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:36:58.650" style="s2">much as it&#39;s done by very young people</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.559" end="00:37:02.220" style="s2">that do this it&#39;s one way for them to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.650" end="00:37:04.349" style="s2">interrogate the states of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.220" end="00:37:06.119" style="s2">intellectualism in the world or to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.349" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">across something I mean it&#39;s one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.119" end="00:37:11.309" style="s2">one way to search in some sense and in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:14.430" style="s2">as much as I actually come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.309" end="00:37:18.450" style="s2">good piece of almost intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.450" end="00:37:26.519" style="s2">of that is is inverted on the troll that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.789" end="00:37:28.829" style="s2">is let&#39;s say not expressing any of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.519" end="00:37:31.380" style="s2">genuine value but literally just looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.829" end="00:37:35.910" style="s2">for how much feels they can kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.380" end="00:37:39.029" style="s2">from the ether usually that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.910" end="00:37:40.980" style="s2">trolling or I&#39;d like to think I have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.029" end="00:37:42.450" style="s2">sixth sense about these things that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.980" end="00:37:45.180" style="s2">know I mean when people are being</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.180" end="00:37:50.740" style="s2">often I rebuke them but I I dismiss I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.089" end="00:37:55.570" style="s2">quite dismissive in my rebuke I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.740" end="00:37:57.250" style="s2">puts a lot of energy into it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.570" end="00:38:00.300" style="s2">there is a kind of art to this and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.250" end="00:38:08.020" style="s2">perhaps I could have discussed this</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.300" end="00:38:14.170" style="s2">better details but anyway in a sense one</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.020" end="00:38:16.630" style="s2">can add purpose to any context even in</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.070" end="00:38:44.530" style="s2">that I think is missing will disagree</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.530" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">no point in bemoaning that someone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:38:55.180" style="s2">expressing a proper purpose I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:38:56.590" style="s2">gets convoluted but you know sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.180" end="00:39:02.140" style="s2">will complain to people that I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.590" end="00:39:04.170" style="s2">they&#39;re being inconsistent that they you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:05.730" style="s2">know that their sense acting like</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.170" end="00:39:08.170" style="s2">pseudo-intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.730" end="00:39:12.010" style="s2">because they&#39;re not actually willing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.170" end="00:39:18.100" style="s2">take on anything although they have kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.010" end="00:39:20.650" style="s2">of suggested that they are you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.100" end="00:39:22.090" style="s2">sorry so I&#39;m making these things and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.650" end="00:39:26.470" style="s2">keep on trying to undermine them as</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.090" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">dicta because no dicta holds the economy</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.470" end="00:39:34.690" style="s2">of purpose is sort of the real game that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:37.570" style="s2">is being played by the IDW less to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.690" end="00:39:43.150" style="s2">or the form of the new game in in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.570" end="00:39:46.350" style="s2">new culture yeah so I think that we must</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:49.350" style="s2">be quite subsets able and vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.350" end="00:39:49.350" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.480" end="00:40:03.190" style="s2">disagreement yeah so the content</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.310" end="00:40:12.030" style="s2">disagreement is what we need to what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.190" end="00:40:14.680" style="s2">need to foster and then suggesting and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.030" end="00:40:18.270" style="s2">and that will always be suggestive of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.680" end="00:40:21.250" style="s2">the economy of purpose that is in play</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.270" end="00:40:25.120" style="s2">in some sense and that is say the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.250" end="00:40:26.440" style="s2">essence of the Methodist the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.120" end="00:40:30.450" style="s2">matter discussion obviously the meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.440" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">discussion can also have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.450" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">content in its own right which is kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:46.360" style="s2">of not centered in the core but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:51.390" style="s2">keep on tracing its particular its roots</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.360" end="00:40:51.390" style="s2">from the core into into that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:57.340" style="s2">yeah but but generally it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.490" end="00:41:04.420" style="s2">discuss those things because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.340" end="00:41:08.520" style="s2">almost of a psychological nature yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.420" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">mean I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like really</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.520" end="00:41:15.640" style="s2">bringing some of my contribution to bear</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.660" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">because it is much like character</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.640" end="00:41:22.660" style="s2">assassination sadly and you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:27.310" style="s2">get away with that as I yeah so I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.660" end="00:41:28.930" style="s2">said the problem with Joe Rogan and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.310" end="00:41:36.490" style="s2">know know that he was sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">discussed as a kind of cultural fact but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.490" end="00:41:46.900" style="s2">that he has this kind of he he Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.100" end="00:41:49.180" style="s2">also has he&#39;s primarily what I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.900" end="00:41:51.760" style="s2">call an introverted censor and he has a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.180" end="00:41:53.320" style="s2">quite I would say almost a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:57.190" style="s2">with introverted thinking although his</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.320" end="00:42:00.310" style="s2">introverted thinking in essence he kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.190" end="00:42:04.990" style="s2">of group group sources that he gets that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.310" end="00:42:06.520" style="s2">from his network of his you know of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.990" end="00:42:08.020" style="s2">people he knows the things he</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.520" end="00:42:09.850" style="s2">understands the things he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.020" end="00:42:10.150" style="s2">experienced he extrapolates that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.850" end="00:42:11.769" style="s2">of in</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.150" end="00:42:17.799" style="s2">Virgen thinking and so he&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.769" end="00:42:19.499" style="s2">his own Overton Window and I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.799" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">the problem that I have with him is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.499" end="00:42:26.289" style="s2">he&#39;s sort of contract you know he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:27.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t really put novel things to him</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.289" end="00:42:30.220" style="s2">and he&#39;s going to it like judge them</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.970" end="00:42:34.299" style="s2">based on first principles he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.220" end="00:42:34.990" style="s2">think that way and it&#39;s not really his</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.299" end="00:42:37.210" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.990" end="00:42:40.599" style="s2">in some sense that&#39;s the character of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.210" end="00:42:41.980" style="s2">his personality style these things are</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.599" end="00:42:44.529" style="s2">subject to change there or subjects</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.980" end="00:42:48.990" style="s2">modification but you know generally</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.529" end="00:42:53.380" style="s2">speaking very few people become</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.990" end="00:42:55.150" style="s2">enlightened you know very few people get</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.380" end="00:43:01.089" style="s2">the kind of self-knowledge that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.150" end="00:43:02.859" style="s2">allows them to change the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.089" end="00:43:06.579" style="s2">functions that they have a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.859" end="00:43:08.109" style="s2">utilizing so but I mean and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.579" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">is a fundamental problem in in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.109" end="00:43:18.249" style="s2">grander scheme of things is that so</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:21.489" style="s2">there is almost a fundamental problem in</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.249" end="00:43:24.299" style="s2">that the IDW cannot you cannot just</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.489" end="00:43:28.359" style="s2">extract a kind of short list or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.299" end="00:43:32.619" style="s2">framework or an outline you have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.359" end="00:43:34.539" style="s2">of understand it you know like you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.619" end="00:43:38.289" style="s2">to kind of own it completely you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.539" end="00:43:41.739" style="s2">just kind of work within its outline you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.289" end="00:43:43.900" style="s2">know and create a kind of a new culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.739" end="00:43:49.869" style="s2">that sort of looks like that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.900" end="00:43:51.549" style="s2">going to fly and different people have</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.869" end="00:43:53.559" style="s2">let&#39;s say different structural</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.549" end="00:43:57.400" style="s2">limitations you know so I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.559" end="00:43:59.619" style="s2">reason why let&#39;s say the IDW or better</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.400" end="00:44:07.259" style="s2">asset or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.619" end="00:44:12.369" style="s2">I mean talking about these issues is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.259" end="00:44:14.109" style="s2">somewhat complicated for me but let me</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.369" end="00:44:17.349" style="s2">just say that at the very least these</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.109" end="00:44:19.400" style="s2">people have been worked on and they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.349" end="00:44:26.130" style="s2">worked on themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.400" end="00:44:31.650" style="s2">and they have made hard choices in terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.130" end="00:44:35.099" style="s2">of their own internal schema and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.650" end="00:44:47.930" style="s2">have sacrificed its some it is something</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.099" end="00:44:47.930" style="s2">like the the Christ archetype you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.819" end="00:44:59.459" style="s2">and you know this process you know is is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.229" end="00:45:02.069" style="s2">described in the Christian scripture but</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.459" end="00:45:05.099" style="s2">you know so sort of to break bread is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.069" end="00:45:09.589" style="s2">break down your understanding and to eat</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.099" end="00:45:12.719" style="s2">it and to break bread with somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.589" end="00:45:16.009" style="s2">you know the kind of the communion and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.719" end="00:45:18.769" style="s2">the sharing of the flesh in the blood</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.009" end="00:45:21.329" style="s2">the breaking of the flesh and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.769" end="00:45:25.229" style="s2">consummation of the blood is you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.329" end="00:45:27.029" style="s2">you you taste it to know is that good</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.229" end="00:45:29.430" style="s2">wine you know what is the effect of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.029" end="00:45:32.130" style="s2">wine what is this blood good enough to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.430" end="00:45:40.190" style="s2">drink you know this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.130" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">spiritual metaphor how does this blood</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.190" end="00:45:45.749" style="s2">operate in somebody else&#39;s life if this</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.140" end="00:45:48.089" style="s2">blood is nourishing somebody else&#39;s soul</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.749" end="00:45:49.949" style="s2">how well does it function in that other</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.089" end="00:45:56.089" style="s2">soul how well does it work in another</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.949" end="00:45:59.279" style="s2">body you know there&#39;s a kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.089" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a universal ethics sort of built</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.279" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">into this and when you get into nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:12.779" style="s2">issues and discerning those issues you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:16.170" style="s2">know it gets generally it can get very</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.779" end="00:46:18.390" style="s2">nasty especially if it&#39;s not done in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.170" end="00:46:20.369" style="s2">right context as I said it requires a</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.390" end="00:46:23.039" style="s2">lot of vulnerability to use another</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.369" end="00:46:25.369" style="s2">spiritual net metaphor it requires to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.039" end="00:46:25.369" style="s2">naked</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.130" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">I mean just just to I mean I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:39.290" style="s2">almost everyone must have had many</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.920" end="00:46:44.360" style="s2">dreams in their childhood about being</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.290" end="00:46:50.420" style="s2">naked in either public places or being</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.360" end="00:46:53.390" style="s2">naked in uncomfortable settings you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.420" end="00:46:55.340" style="s2">and and I mean I feel sorry for people</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.390" end="00:46:57.230" style="s2">who did not have dreams like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.340" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">because if you didn&#39;t have dreams like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.230" end="00:47:03.740" style="s2">that you&#39;re certainly not looking in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:09.140" style="s2">right places you you&#39;re not asking the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.740" end="00:47:11.240" style="s2">right questions you know it&#39;s one that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.140" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">one might be engaged in the same process</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.240" end="00:47:17.780" style="s2">without having the dream one could have</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.350" end="00:47:19.880" style="s2">similar veins of sort of daydreaming</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.780" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s mean the same thing that have</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">nothing to do with being naked but have</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:33.220" style="s2">anyway I&#39;m not going to get in tune to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:33.220" style="s2">sort of so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.770" end="00:47:44.310" style="s2">there is a problem of specialized</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.510" end="00:47:44.310" style="s2">knowledge in the sense in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:53.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that is just going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.920" end="00:47:59.800" style="s2">take on in culture it does require a</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.770" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">common purpose or reaching a greater</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.780" end="00:48:43.150" style="s2">something that essentially just becomes</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.310" end="00:49:06.940" style="s2">at that time but because it was not</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.070" end="00:49:08.440" style="s2">translated throughout the culture in an</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.940" end="00:49:10.320" style="s2">authentic enough way because it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.440" end="00:49:13.510" style="s2">ripped off because it was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.320" end="00:49:15.460" style="s2">counterfeited well enough that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.510" end="00:49:21.790" style="s2">essentially that that becomes the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.460" end="00:49:26.110" style="s2">kind of the new shell that sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.790" end="00:49:30.310" style="s2">passes these these kind of superficial</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.110" end="00:49:34.770" style="s2">tests in terms of consistency and sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.310" end="00:49:34.770" style="s2">of those patterns of consistency</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.670" end="00:49:53.720" style="s2">I can understand the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:55.640" style="s2">interest in looking for those but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.720" end="00:49:57.589" style="s2">and that is certainly the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.640" end="00:49:59.990" style="s2">people who have let&#39;s say a creative</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.589" end="00:50:01.910" style="s2">introverted thinking and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">creative in the sense of the the</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:11.180" style="s2">personality matrix which is not a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.970" end="00:50:13.460" style="s2">not a personality matrix that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.180" end="00:50:15.500" style="s2">personally believe in but it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.460" end="00:50:20.599" style="s2">enough approximation and I&#39;m certainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.500" end="00:50:22.549" style="s2">don&#39;t have the space to to get into my</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.599" end="00:50:27.589" style="s2">personality theory which is sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.549" end="00:50:37.660" style="s2">known and unpublished and without a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.589" end="00:50:37.660" style="s2">platform but you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.099" end="00:51:05.509" style="s2">I would say that the by that one I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.459" end="00:51:05.509" style="s2">that punch but</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.490" end="00:51:27.059" style="s2">yeah so the whole superhero analogy</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">I guess I mean the problem with his</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:45.640" style="s2">exploration I guess is is that each</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:49.720" style="s2">superhero must have an origin story must</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.640" end="00:51:52.890" style="s2">have a sufficient and necessary origin</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.720" end="00:51:56.830" style="s2">story and although there are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.890" end="00:51:59.590" style="s2">those will vary as the the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.830" end="00:52:01.900" style="s2">themselves vary and they all seem to if</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.590" end="00:52:04.510" style="s2">they&#39;re all you know in the class of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.900" end="00:52:06.250" style="s2">superhero at the end of the day and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.510" end="00:52:08.380" style="s2">all have various different powers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.250" end="00:52:12.180" style="s2">all fine and they all have various</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.380" end="00:52:15.850" style="s2">different degrees of acclaim or or</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.180" end="00:52:18.250" style="s2">purview in terms of the types of matters</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.850" end="00:52:19.800" style="s2">that they contend themselves with that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.250" end="00:52:22.030" style="s2">also is all fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.800" end="00:52:23.290" style="s2">but I think what is being overlooked in</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.030" end="00:52:26.200" style="s2">this analogy in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.290" end="00:52:28.060" style="s2">conversation is the origin story and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.200" end="00:52:34.410" style="s2">kind of the faithfulness of the origin</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.060" end="00:52:43.930" style="s2">story and that let&#39;s just say the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.410" end="00:52:46.300" style="s2">all of the all of the superheroes are on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.930" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge of their let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.300" end="00:52:50.590" style="s2">their own character developments in</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:52.990" style="s2">terms of why they are where they&#39;re are</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.590" end="00:52:57.540" style="s2">where they are they know why they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.990" end="00:53:06.970" style="s2">there and that cannot be formulaic Lee</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.540" end="00:53:11.320" style="s2">derived and modeled and mimicked yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.970" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">and I do think that there is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:21.940" style="s2">the core belief thinking is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:24.580" style="s2">missing from this discussion and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.940" end="00:53:26.680" style="s2">know sadly when I raise these points it</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.580" end="00:53:30.780" style="s2">has to come up at let&#39;s say the expense</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.680" end="00:53:30.780" style="s2">of Joe Rogan because I do think that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.500" end="00:53:40.360" style="s2">wonder even if Joe Rogan would would</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.470" end="00:53:45.360" style="s2">even be able to receive a lot of almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.360" end="00:53:45.360" style="s2">these IDW guests unless there was</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.390" end="00:53:49.750" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:52.210" style="s2">this criticism or it&#39;s not the this</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.750" end="00:53:55.329" style="s2">critique mere Allah said critique rather</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.210" end="00:53:58.420" style="s2">than criticism as I don&#39;t mean it to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.329" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">critical but I think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.420" end="00:54:05.829" style="s2">give you that even what&#39;s-his-name</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:07.690" style="s2">Ruben I always get his first name wrong</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.829" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">he said Paul Ruben I don&#39;t know I keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.690" end="00:54:17.430" style="s2">forgetting his name but Ruben of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:22.150" style="s2">Rubin report I think even he potentially</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.430" end="00:54:23.710" style="s2">would not have moved over from his</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.150" end="00:54:27.640" style="s2">liberal echo-chamber</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.710" end="00:54:29.560" style="s2">unless there was a certain scale of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.640" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">was going on in the greater society</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.560" end="00:54:35.890" style="s2">unless there was a kind of if this was</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:38.680" style="s2">just one glitch in the matrix I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.890" end="00:54:42.070" style="s2">know if he would have actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.680" end="00:54:44.589" style="s2">recognized it because except that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.070" end="00:54:50.050" style="s2">were these many things happening and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.589" end="00:54:51.700" style="s2">I think Joe Rogan is is such almost a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.050" end="00:54:57.339" style="s2">repository of a kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.700" end="00:55:01.660" style="s2">experience of of what he sees as as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.339" end="00:55:08.829" style="s2">kind of you know like he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.660" end="00:55:13.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t construe facts for himself I</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.829" end="00:55:13.710" style="s2">have to contextualize this properly like</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.300" end="00:55:23.050" style="s2">he would not be the first person to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.650" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">a claim a fact he sort of gets his</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.050" end="00:55:33.250" style="s2">standards and even principles in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:37.240" style="s2">of crowd-sourced way and in as much as</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.250" end="00:55:40.089" style="s2">that he becomes an organ of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.240" end="00:55:41.890" style="s2">a much larger movement so he&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.089" end="00:55:47.920" style="s2">thinking process with his audience</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.890" end="00:55:50.140" style="s2">almost that is let&#39;s say more open and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.920" end="00:55:53.859" style="s2">that&#39;s probably what perhaps allows him</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.140" end="00:55:56.680" style="s2">to draw a broader appeal because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.859" end="00:55:59.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say not not as judgmental as he as</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.680" end="00:56:01.059" style="s2">perceptive he is very perceptive but not</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.650" end="00:56:05.279" style="s2">as judgmental and that man</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.059" end="00:56:10.599" style="s2">sometimes as an incredibly almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.279" end="00:56:15.059" style="s2">capricious judgmental the only example I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.599" end="00:56:26.409" style="s2">can think of is if you look at his</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.059" end="00:56:38.969" style="s2">exchange with Milo gianopolous if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.409" end="00:56:38.969" style="s2">just sort of take a very minut you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.089" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">for following the threads of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.769" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">intellectual threads of that exchange</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.490" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">and the kind of the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.160" end="00:57:05.210" style="s2">substance that is being traded in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:15.800" style="s2">exchange were being offered and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.210" end="00:57:18.619" style="s2">counter-offered yeah so so I see figures</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.800" end="00:57:20.390" style="s2">like Joe Rogan at least how I believe he</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.619" end="00:57:25.550" style="s2">was discussed in this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.390" end="00:57:27.290" style="s2">that he was being roughly this claim is</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.550" end="00:57:28.760" style="s2">was not directly made but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.290" end="00:57:31.790" style="s2">reason why Joe Rogan entered the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.760" end="00:57:37.490" style="s2">discussion was because he&#39;s roughly seen</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.790" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">as we need a robust middle ground where</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.490" end="00:57:44.390" style="s2">things happen and we need to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:48.080" style="s2">create the landscape of culture you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.390" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">all all the topics brought up in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.080" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">conversation or like you know it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:56.360" style="s2">of it&#39;s it&#39;s talking right at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:59.540" style="s2">of of things that are kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.360" end="00:58:01.670" style="s2">in the zeitgeist of this burgeoning new</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.540" end="00:58:04.280" style="s2">era or something like that or you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.670" end="00:58:07.580" style="s2">like it&#39;s sort of you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.280" end="00:58:16.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quite almost a visionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.580" end="00:58:16.840" style="s2">reading on on sort of the likely</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.290" end="00:58:27.970" style="s2">framework and structure of how culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.450" end="00:58:27.970" style="s2">is broadly evolving and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:37.870" style="s2">to me it loses its spiritual elements</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.100" end="00:58:40.270" style="s2">and when I say spiritual I mean like in</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.870" end="00:58:42.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s being led by the collective</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.270" end="00:58:46.810" style="s2">noun of human beings and it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.880" end="00:58:49.420" style="s2">led by the decision of human beings of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.810" end="00:58:51.550" style="s2">what is within human beings yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.420" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">even in the discussion in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.550" end="00:58:56.020" style="s2">how how anything develops you know like</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:58:58.990" style="s2">Jordan greenhalgh was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.020" end="00:59:02.500" style="s2">courage that you know people have this</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.990" end="00:59:05.710" style="s2">kind of instinctive Drive to know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.500" end="00:59:08.230" style="s2">that you know if our culture is not a</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.890" end="01:02:32.840" style="s2">you see that those points I think are</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.599" end="01:03:44.190" style="s2">least stands in the minds of anyone</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.789" end="01:03:47.529" style="s2">listening to this I think it has value</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.190" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">in that sense that some understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.529" end="01:03:56.739" style="s2">these sorts of pitfalls are important in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.319" end="01:03:59.739" style="s2">general but also that there is some</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.739" end="01:04:03.249" style="s2">intellectual value that can be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.739" end="01:04:06.099" style="s2">extracted from rebuking this and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.249" end="01:04:09.699" style="s2">this in not just generally but also in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.099" end="01:04:12.940" style="s2">particular in as much as that you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.699" end="01:04:15.579" style="s2">eventually tether up those systems</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.940" end="01:04:18.369" style="s2">there&#39;s those relics of introverted</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.579" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">thinking you can kind of systematize</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.369" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">them into a kind of ideological you you</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:28.449" style="s2">have to kind of find some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:30.009" style="s2">holistic framework a is the prominent</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.449" end="01:04:33.069" style="s2">with ti-ti is always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.009" end="01:04:43.089" style="s2">poisonous unless you can kind of create</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.069" end="01:04:44.979" style="s2">a some kind of interface like I I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.089" end="01:04:47.109" style="s2">want to bring up all these strange</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.979" end="01:04:52.150" style="s2">spiritual sort of analogies and things</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.109" end="01:04:54.809" style="s2">like that but there are networks that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.150" end="01:04:58.479" style="s2">can be made between different people</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.809" end="01:05:01.029" style="s2">that can synergize and reinforce each</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.479" end="01:05:03.819" style="s2">other in a positive way and so that in</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.029" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">tandem with other people&#39;s gifts let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.819" end="01:05:07.749" style="s2">just say you can create something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">greater than the sum of its parts and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.749" end="01:05:17.890" style="s2">you can almost kind of create a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:19.989" style="s2">a human mechanism made up of spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.890" end="01:05:22.719" style="s2">gifts and let&#39;s say psychological</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.989" end="01:05:24.609" style="s2">insights that if you have a good enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.719" end="01:05:27.249" style="s2">working system I mean generally the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.609" end="01:05:28.789" style="s2">problem with Ti is that it&#39;s can only</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.249" end="01:05:40.470" style="s2">really be used</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.789" end="01:05:45.930" style="s2">- to fix problems it cannot be used to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.470" end="01:05:48.890" style="s2">sort of - so and and it can it fix us it</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.930" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">can be used to sort of diagnose problems</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.890" end="01:05:59.099" style="s2">perhaps the arm is try to be very</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:06:01.020" style="s2">precise otherwise we&#39;d mislead people it</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.099" end="01:06:02.940" style="s2">can&#39;t so yeah it doesn&#39;t fix the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.020" end="01:06:07.380" style="s2">problems but it can diagnose problems</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.940" end="01:06:09.720" style="s2">but it really is very bad at suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.380" end="01:06:15.089" style="s2">what the solution is because it almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.720" end="01:06:24.539" style="s2">it has no yeah so it really is something</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.089" end="01:06:26.250" style="s2">that kind of yes generally even I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.539" end="01:06:29.779" style="s2">you then will the times in which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.250" end="01:06:32.670" style="s2">used TI is that is when when TI</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.779" end="01:06:35.279" style="s2">fragmented TI will will put holes in</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.670" end="01:06:36.930" style="s2">something then you actually don&#39;t throw</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.279" end="01:06:38.970" style="s2">it away</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.930" end="01:06:41.369" style="s2">the thing with holes in it you use those</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.970" end="01:06:42.809" style="s2">holes as a way for it to kind of puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.369" end="01:06:46.109" style="s2">piece into something else</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.809" end="01:06:47.670" style="s2">you know and and but T I will tell you</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.109" end="01:06:50.359" style="s2">nothing about what the puzzle piece of</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.670" end="01:06:55.589" style="s2">with you know that requires a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.359" end="01:06:57.770" style="s2">leap of something else and the key the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.589" end="01:06:59.910" style="s2">the occasion between those puzzle things</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.770" end="01:07:02.480" style="s2">essentially will never be intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.910" end="01:07:11.220" style="s2">justified it will only ever be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.480" end="01:07:13.440" style="s2">pragmatically you know so in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.220" end="01:07:17.539" style="s2">you can never impose these these sorts</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.440" end="01:07:20.940" style="s2">of will never find use for these things</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.539" end="01:07:25.319" style="s2">in very strict arenas that have to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.940" end="01:07:30.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say universally ethical you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.319" end="01:07:35.160" style="s2">only find efficacy for this kind of can</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:38.210" style="s2">only find utility when you&#39;re dealing in</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.160" end="01:07:40.130" style="s2">sort of creative enterprises like</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.210" end="01:07:42.040" style="s2">constructing</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.130" end="01:07:43.700" style="s2">something where everyone involved is</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.040" end="01:07:47.600" style="s2">consenting you know sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.700" end="01:07:49.850" style="s2">devising businesses or sort of creating</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.600" end="01:07:52.160" style="s2">something constructive with with a group</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.850" end="01:07:59.570" style="s2">of people you&#39;re not going to this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.160" end="01:08:04.270" style="s2">not a way to to do government except in</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.570" end="01:08:07.570" style="s2">some kind of voluntary sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.270" end="01:08:14.840" style="s2">self-government that you know is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.570" end="01:08:21.350" style="s2">constituted you know so the ti-ti is</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.840" end="01:08:24.130" style="s2">hope but it is hope already kind of has</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.350" end="01:08:27.620" style="s2">to presuppose a sort of faith it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.130" end="01:08:37.280" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have any specific expression</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.620" end="01:08:39.140" style="s2">of faith the context of the hope will</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.280" end="01:08:42.200" style="s2">give you the character of the faith</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.140" end="01:08:48.320" style="s2">attached to it and this is getting so</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.200" end="01:08:50.300" style="s2">tangential as I said the the problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.320" end="01:08:53.330" style="s2">with Ti is that it is useful but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.300" end="01:08:57.230" style="s2">only useful if you have it in a complete</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.330" end="01:08:59.450" style="s2">holistic sort of ironclad thing and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.230" end="01:09:05.090" style="s2">know you can&#39;t really do that in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.450" end="01:09:06.980" style="s2">intellectualism well I mean you can but</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.090" end="01:09:10.930" style="s2">it&#39;s then your expressions won&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.980" end="01:09:17.960" style="s2">the form of Ti they&#39;re going to be in an</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.930" end="01:09:19.580" style="s2">array of things so yeah I mean Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.960" end="01:09:21.200" style="s2">Greenhalgh would have to become a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.580" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">different sort of intellectual I guess</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.200" end="01:09:30.010" style="s2">for him to to take on board the things</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:30.010" style="s2">that I have said and</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.309" end="01:09:48.920" style="s2">so you know yeah this is why this is why</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">character assassination this is not is</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.920" end="01:10:03.889" style="s2">not desirable you know I mean roughly</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:09.039" style="s2">speaking why people don&#39;t bother you</p>

<p begin="01:10:09.039" end="01:10:18.260" style="s2">their atheism because it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.659" end="01:10:20.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s such a kind of well I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.260" end="01:10:22.780" style="s2">intellectual sort of esoteric crowd why</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.840" end="01:10:27.079" style="s2">they you know who let&#39;s say are</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.780" end="01:10:32.559" style="s2">generally intellectually the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.079" end="01:10:32.559" style="s2">are more intelligence than the atheists</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.980" end="01:10:36.670" style="s2">why they don&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:47.790" style="s2">because people are let&#39;s say so</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.390" end="01:10:48.810" style="s2">psychologically invested and people are</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.790" end="01:10:50.340" style="s2">certainly going to be more</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:11:00.390" style="s2">really that I mean just to say to make a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:04.730" style="s2">general point which is perhaps going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.390" end="01:11:04.730" style="s2">be quite provocative but um you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.000" end="01:11:14.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the spirit of man Satan or</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.910" end="01:11:22.200" style="s2">whatever you want to call it the the the</p>

<p begin="01:11:27.900" end="01:11:40.380" style="s2">the temporal things that these are baked</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.980" end="01:11:45.890" style="s2">into the personality style on the level</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.380" end="01:11:50.520" style="s2">of a kind of psychological ideology and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.890" end="01:11:52.950" style="s2">that is where Satan lives let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.520" end="01:11:56.520" style="s2">whether or not you say bad things about</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.950" end="01:12:00.180" style="s2">what you label Satan or the spirit of</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.620" end="01:12:05.490" style="s2">that links to the psychological paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.510" end="01:12:11.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s somewhat meaningless and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.490" end="01:12:16.200" style="s2">know so even if someone is is a atheist</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.750" end="01:12:19.590" style="s2">or all professors to believe in in God</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.200" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">you know it&#39;s doesn&#39;t really matter on</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.590" end="01:12:24.870" style="s2">on the psychological level the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:26.820" style="s2">is do they believe in fatalism do they</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.870" end="01:12:31.400" style="s2">believe in determinism do they believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.820" end="01:12:31.400" style="s2">that they live in a kind of magical</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:43.800" style="s2">statements with I don&#39;t want to sort of</p>

<p begin="01:12:43.800" end="01:12:49.310" style="s2">there really is no difference in</p>

<p begin="01:12:49.310" end="01:12:54.030" style="s2">believing in fatalism and determinism</p>

<p begin="01:13:11.460" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">know you you I mean a lot of pagan</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.050" end="01:13:19.230" style="s2">there are a lot of different species of</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:21.030" style="s2">a lot of different beliefs in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.230" end="01:13:23.160" style="s2">how people self-identify but the real</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.030" end="01:13:25.350" style="s2">question is do you believe that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.160" end="01:13:27.900" style="s2">spirits do you believe that the economy</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.350" end="01:13:33.750" style="s2">of purpose that you&#39;re engaged in that</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.900" end="01:13:36.780" style="s2">that is the highest level of action you</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.750" end="01:13:38.969" style="s2">know you either believe in that or you</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.780" end="01:13:44.460" style="s2">don&#39;t you believe that you are subject</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.969" end="01:13:48.060" style="s2">to to to time to determinism well the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.460" end="01:13:50.130" style="s2">time of the soul fatalism you know if</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.060" end="01:13:52.230" style="s2">your soul is controlled by an external</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.130" end="01:13:54.510" style="s2">forces not controlled by your economy of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.230" end="01:14:01.650" style="s2">purpose what does it mean to love your</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.510" end="01:14:03.500" style="s2">brother if you believe in fatalism you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.650" end="01:14:06.270" style="s2">know it degrades everything you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.500" end="01:14:08.310" style="s2">when you degrade the economy of purpose</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.270" end="01:14:12.750" style="s2">then your purpose essentially is as</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.310" end="01:14:16.739" style="s2">cheap as what whatever economy is is</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.750" end="01:14:18.989" style="s2">sort of governing it and so if you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.739" end="01:14:23.520" style="s2">an economy of fatalism or an economy of</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.989" end="01:14:25.560" style="s2">determinism that that is your God at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.520" end="01:14:27.840" style="s2">end of the day and determinism is your</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.560" end="01:14:29.370" style="s2">God so it doesn&#39;t matter if you say that</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.840" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">you&#39;re an atheist if you believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.370" end="01:14:33.660" style="s2">essentially that time is the ruler of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:39.390" style="s2">all things so is you know essentially</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.660" end="01:14:44.820" style="s2">time is your authority or some other</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.390" end="01:14:47.670" style="s2">physical property or some other anyway</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.820" end="01:14:52.590" style="s2">these are metaphysical claims you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.670" end="01:14:55.110" style="s2">and so you know it is a very high bar to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.590" end="01:14:59.250" style="s2">admission into the club in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.110" end="01:15:03.650" style="s2">because you you have to you have to say</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.250" end="01:15:03.650" style="s2">you have to sort of take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.040" end="01:15:09.219" style="s2">but when you do that you get the power</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.250" end="01:15:12.280" style="s2">as it were</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.219" end="01:15:13.719" style="s2">you become a superhero and you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.280" end="01:15:14.949" style="s2">these sorts of core beliefs you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.719" end="01:15:16.329" style="s2">that they can be accessed through</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.949" end="01:15:18.219" style="s2">narrative and we definitely need</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.329" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">narratives probably better narratives</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.219" end="01:15:23.650" style="s2">than just the superhero analogy as I</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:26.499" style="s2">said that what is probably missing in</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.650" end="01:15:31.960" style="s2">this discussion is that the origin story</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.499" end="01:15:33.849" style="s2">is more important than just looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.960" end="01:15:36.400" style="s2">these capes and these superheroes is</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.849" end="01:15:38.920" style="s2">that what is hidden behind the cape is</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.400" end="01:15:43.840" style="s2">the origin story the public doesn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.920" end="01:15:51.429" style="s2">the origin story and so yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.840" end="01:15:56.260" style="s2">finally going to stop talking now I just</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.429" end="01:15:59.800" style="s2">want to quickly go back and fill in on</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.260" end="01:16:03.749" style="s2">at least one point when I was describing</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.800" end="01:16:11.590" style="s2">girag and I never made a good enough</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.749" end="01:16:13.449" style="s2">description about at least yeah I this</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.590" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">is because I was roughly trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.449" end="01:16:17.800" style="s2">collect recollect something that I had</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:20.050" style="s2">said in a conversation to somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.800" end="01:16:23.050" style="s2">but I&#39;ll just fill in their detail other</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.050" end="01:16:25.090" style="s2">the the problem that I see with Joe</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.050" end="01:16:27.610" style="s2">Rogan&#39;s intellectualism essentially is</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.090" end="01:16:30.729" style="s2">that his tact in dealing with the topic</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.610" end="01:16:33.639" style="s2">or dealing with someone&#39;s opinion or</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.729" end="01:16:40.150" style="s2">what someone says is almost not a kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.639" end="01:16:42.219" style="s2">of universal test that he applies you</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.150" end="01:16:44.739" style="s2">know he how he sort of deals with things</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.219" end="01:16:47.679" style="s2">or the merit of someone&#39;s ideas is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.739" end="01:16:50.530" style="s2">on a first principles basis it&#39;s more on</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.679" end="01:16:53.739" style="s2">the basis of if he already agrees with</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.530" end="01:16:56.050" style="s2">you or not and so there&#39;s a kind of at</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.739" end="01:16:59.860" style="s2">least in terms of intellectualism what</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.050" end="01:17:05.019" style="s2">seems to be a kind of a very almost</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.860" end="01:17:07.539" style="s2">capricious treatment and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.019" end="01:17:09.880" style="s2">has its value because in a sense he is</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.539" end="01:17:12.610" style="s2">representing all the very many opinions</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.880" end="01:17:15.420" style="s2">and factions on this topic which he has</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.610" end="01:17:18.699" style="s2">kind of generally perceived and fielded</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.420" end="01:17:22.469" style="s2">from what he considers at least</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.699" end="01:17:24.539" style="s2">respectable elements within</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.469" end="01:17:25.800" style="s2">general society or population or</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.539" end="01:17:28.280" style="s2">something like that you know see who</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.800" end="01:17:33.030" style="s2">love he will often I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.280" end="01:17:37.380" style="s2">actually consume a lot of his his work</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.030" end="01:17:40.800" style="s2">but he will reference feelings and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.380" end="01:17:45.300" style="s2">opinions out there which he will kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.800" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">have quite somewhat of a holistic record</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.300" end="01:17:52.999" style="s2">of and repository for dispensing you</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:56.570" style="s2">know and he will have almost a his</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.999" end="01:17:58.619" style="s2">record of almost like a matrix of</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.570" end="01:18:02.400" style="s2">controversy and a matron you know in</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.619" end="01:18:04.469" style="s2">terms of the various factions that he</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.400" end="01:18:06.210" style="s2">sees that that have a dog in the fight</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.469" end="01:18:09.239" style="s2">or something like that and how he keeps</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.210" end="01:18:13.170" style="s2">tabs on that is also perhaps why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.239" end="01:18:17.760" style="s2">able to at least be a platform that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.170" end="01:18:23.699" style="s2">caters to a very broad audience but what</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.760" end="01:18:26.190" style="s2">he is in fact modeling is is something</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.699" end="01:18:31.829" style="s2">that at least I find doesn&#39;t bear record</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.190" end="01:18:33.539" style="s2">to any core belief or universal ethic or</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.829" end="01:18:42.210" style="s2">anything like that it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.539" end="01:18:43.800" style="s2">kind of substantive or you know and as I</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.210" end="01:18:47.729" style="s2">say that comes through very clearly in</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.800" end="01:18:50.789" style="s2">his articulation and treatment almost</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.729" end="01:18:53.579" style="s2">just of ideas themselves and so he sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.789" end="01:18:55.110" style="s2">of stuck being some kind of pundit and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.579" end="01:18:57.510" style="s2">you have to hope that he is being</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.110" end="01:19:00.979" style="s2">corralled enough why let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.510" end="01:19:03.929" style="s2">collective experience in which he is</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.929" end="01:19:14.610" style="s2">situate himself but he gets kind of sort</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.539" end="01:19:17.460" style="s2">of he&#39;s sort of just in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.610" end="01:19:22.710" style="s2">general trend in the general movement or</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.460" end="01:19:30.690" style="s2">whatever and I mean for various reasons</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.710" end="01:19:33.139" style="s2">this lends itself to modeling things</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.690" end="01:19:33.139" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.900" end="01:19:43.980" style="s2">oh yeah I&#39;ve made in my own mind at</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.770" end="01:19:45.920" style="s2">least I&#39;ve made probably in recordings</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.980" end="01:19:49.380" style="s2">that I&#39;ve made that I have not uploaded</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.920" end="01:19:51.570" style="s2">there are comedians especially have this</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.380" end="01:19:53.970" style="s2">when they are let&#39;s say somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.570" end="01:19:57.960" style="s2">offering social commentary and/or</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.970" end="01:20:01.890" style="s2">political analysis I mean not all I</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.960" end="01:20:04.080" style="s2">would say George Carlin had a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.890" end="01:20:13.260" style="s2">first principles sort of stance on</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.080" end="01:20:21.060" style="s2">things and said Bill Hicks I&#39;m so bad</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.260" end="01:20:26.820" style="s2">with names his name wasn&#39;t Steven Hicks</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.060" end="01:20:36.450" style="s2">Fawcett I think was I think it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.820" end="01:20:39.870" style="s2">Bill Hicks anyway I mean not that their</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.450" end="01:20:43.230" style="s2">body of work sort of has a large amount</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.870" end="01:20:47.360" style="s2">of social commentaries but at least I</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.230" end="01:20:47.360" style="s2">can imagine these are people that would</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:55.070" style="s2">be particularly in their defense of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.540" end="01:20:55.070" style="s2">their points of view let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.910" end="01:21:01.910" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.460" end="01:21:18.770" style="s2">let me tie this into the thesis the</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.330" end="01:21:22.290" style="s2">general thesis that I was making is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.770" end="01:21:24.030" style="s2">it is problematic therefore that some</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.290" end="01:21:26.850" style="s2">people have personality styles that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.030" end="01:21:33.300" style="s2">less capable of exuding a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.850" end="01:21:39.030" style="s2">Independence or uncompromised stance and</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.300" end="01:21:41.730" style="s2">that is somewhat more susceptible you</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.030" end="01:21:44.760" style="s2">know it is unfortunate that in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.730" end="01:21:47.190" style="s2">for some people as they are in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.760" end="01:21:50.489" style="s2">I would say the development of their</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.190" end="01:21:52.890" style="s2">personality or false ego or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.489" end="01:21:58.290" style="s2">language you want to use that they have</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.890" end="01:22:02.159" style="s2">not yet created enough self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.290" end="01:22:07.890" style="s2">let&#39;s just say to to be aware of certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.159" end="01:22:10.800" style="s2">things and and you know try to sort of I</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.890" end="01:22:12.780" style="s2">was trying to sketch out in in the main</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.800" end="01:22:19.050" style="s2">recording that I made that this is an</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.780" end="01:22:20.790" style="s2">addendum to that that you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.050" end="01:22:27.060" style="s2">when you try to sort of address these</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.790" end="01:22:30.179" style="s2">issues you&#39;re starting in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.060" end="01:22:33.949" style="s2">with almost nothing in in a naked state</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.179" end="01:22:37.620" style="s2">and a completely undeveloped state</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.949" end="01:22:40.940" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to develop a new faculty</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.620" end="01:22:45.900" style="s2">or facility within your character and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.940" end="01:22:47.909" style="s2">that is incredibly daunting and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.900" end="01:22:53.100" style="s2">having to go through the phases of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.909" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">say redevelopment and hopefully more of</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.100" end="01:22:57.060" style="s2">a pristine way because if you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:23:00.570" style="s2">just going to mix it haphazardly with</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.060" end="01:23:02.250" style="s2">how you&#39;ve already collected experiences</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.570" end="01:23:06.900" style="s2">you know essentially it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.250" end="01:23:12.960" style="s2">impossible to sort of not just continue</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.900" end="01:23:17.550" style="s2">the same mistakes in some slightly more</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.960" end="01:23:21.359" style="s2">cryptic or subtle way that the arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.550" end="01:23:24.539" style="s2">compounded in perhaps under some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.359" end="01:23:25.919" style="s2">general guys you know and and then you</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.539" end="01:23:29.899" style="s2">know that can also be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.919" end="01:23:29.899" style="s2">process of development that then one</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.049" end="01:23:38.369" style="s2">takes if one can read iagnosed or re</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.859" end="01:23:42.749" style="s2">submit oneself to some sort of exercise</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.369" end="01:23:45.649" style="s2">of reform or revision you you can sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.749" end="01:23:49.169" style="s2">of see a meta pattern</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.649" end="01:23:55.859" style="s2">and sort of getting closer to the root</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.169" end="01:24:01.739" style="s2">of it in terms of manufacturing some</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.859" end="01:24:07.069" style="s2">sort of realignment or growth at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.739" end="01:24:07.069" style="s2">point at which one was delimited into</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.699" end="01:24:12.779" style="s2">yeah it is interesting because people</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.349" end="01:24:15.839" style="s2">are shaped a lot by their experiences</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.779" end="01:24:19.799" style="s2">and I mean this in a positive way in</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.839" end="01:24:22.109" style="s2">that when one is confronted with</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.799" end="01:24:24.419" style="s2">something and let&#39;s say demolished and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.109" end="01:24:27.209" style="s2">then there is a restructuring that comes</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.419" end="01:24:32.389" style="s2">from that that the experience somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.209" end="01:24:32.389" style="s2">which is part of their narrative then</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.779" end="01:24:40.069" style="s2">perhaps a narrative around their core</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.069" end="01:24:43.439" style="s2">belief enables them to articulate</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.069" end="01:24:46.439" style="s2">something new something that is from a</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.439" end="01:24:50.909" style="s2">synthesis and so in some sense you get a</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.439" end="01:24:53.609" style="s2">piece of somebody else worked into your</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.909" end="01:24:58.369" style="s2">character and as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.609" end="01:25:01.369" style="s2">conscious about this in a sense you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.369" end="01:25:01.369" style="s2">somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.680" end="01:25:12.840" style="s2">in this sense there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.300" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">constant communication between different</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.840" end="01:25:20.580" style="s2">people that you can almost use the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.400" end="01:25:23.760" style="s2">strengths of others and I want to use a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.580" end="01:25:26.400" style="s2">word it&#39;s something like emulation but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.760" end="01:25:28.410" style="s2">mean that almost in the kind of in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.400" end="01:25:32.550" style="s2">technological sense of a me that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.410" end="01:25:35.190" style="s2">like you&#39;re emulating a different</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.550" end="01:25:39.600" style="s2">platform with with the hardware that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.190" end="01:25:51.360" style="s2">have and when you are consciously</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.600" end="01:25:55.140" style="s2">emulating yeah you can also then</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.360" end="01:25:58.350" style="s2">recognize that even your your original</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.140" end="01:26:00.690" style="s2">false ego is itself a form of emulation</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.350" end="01:26:05.460" style="s2">but often it&#39;s a kind of unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.690" end="01:26:09.200" style="s2">reactive you know thing that lots of</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.460" end="01:26:09.200" style="s2">ways of describing it primal hurt</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.170" end="01:26:48.520" style="s2">remember what that book was I think it</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.530" end="01:26:53.320" style="s2">was called something like sacred</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.520" end="01:26:55.240" style="s2">contracts it has some what it&#39;s some it</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.320" end="01:26:57.480" style="s2">has some kind of theory of primal hurt</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.240" end="01:27:03.430" style="s2">in it I I didn&#39;t read the book but I did</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.480" end="01:27:06.660" style="s2">I did</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.430" end="01:27:11.080" style="s2">I think inform some of the author&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.660" end="01:27:17.410" style="s2">knowledge in this area it was a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.080" end="01:27:26.370" style="s2">long time ago but anyway um yeah I make</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.410" end="01:27:29.110" style="s2">all these claims white prove three</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.370" end="01:27:38.460" style="s2">traulsen to substantiate at some point</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.110" end="01:27:38.460" style="s2">but also can be said about this is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.350" end="01:27:45.130" style="s2">this does get somewhat more convoluted</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.760" end="01:27:47.680" style="s2">in that there is a there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.130" end="01:27:54.610" style="s2">psychological politics in culture always</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.680" end="01:27:58.240" style="s2">in some sense and I think until the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.610" end="01:28:01.630" style="s2">general culture is until there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.240" end="01:28:03.430" style="s2">general knowledge about this activity</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.630" end="01:28:06.550" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in culture and this</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.430" end="01:28:08.050" style="s2">level of deconstructing culture into</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.550" end="01:28:12.670" style="s2">this level of awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.050" end="01:28:14.590" style="s2">understanding and the consciousness of</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.670" end="01:28:17.520" style="s2">psychological politics until we have</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.590" end="01:28:26.470" style="s2">that there&#39;s going to be no ball walk</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.520" end="01:28:28.360" style="s2">against essentially just I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.470" end="01:28:29.429" style="s2">most important part of culture as a word</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.360" end="01:28:32.229" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.429" end="01:28:35.739" style="s2">there are certain elements which have</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.229" end="01:28:40.780" style="s2">let&#39;s say always been unconscious that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.739" end="01:28:43.989" style="s2">would like to say that generally the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.780" end="01:28:51.789" style="s2">plutocratic element within culture has</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.989" end="01:28:56.519" style="s2">always been served by a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.789" end="01:28:58.360" style="s2">sympathetic bond with the so-called</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.519" end="01:29:00.309" style="s2">revolutionaries you know the people like</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.360" end="01:29:04.419" style="s2">Russell Brand I find very intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.309" end="01:29:06.699" style="s2">cheap and you know these are actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.419" end="01:29:08.260" style="s2">you know that they pretend to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.699" end="01:29:10.059" style="s2">visionaries but they are in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.260" end="01:29:21.489" style="s2">most reactionary sorts of people you can</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.059" end="01:29:23.739" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s that kind of I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.489" end="01:29:25.780" style="s2">the interview with Russell Brand and</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.739" end="01:29:29.010" style="s2">Candice Owens almost just wish I could</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.780" end="01:29:32.380" style="s2">sort of just pause that exchange and</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.010" end="01:29:33.699" style="s2">interject with a whole slew of critiques</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.380" end="01:29:38.169" style="s2">against Russell Brand&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.699" end="01:29:39.969" style="s2">mindlessness essentially and and the</p>

<p begin="01:29:39.969" end="01:29:48.070" style="s2">owns was was making which could be</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.949" end="01:29:53.050" style="s2">elaborated into credibly robust and</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.070" end="01:29:55.689" style="s2">broad rebukes against again the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:29:55.689" end="01:30:04.959" style="s2">at the core of Russell Brand&#39;s wishful</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.150" end="01:30:12.189" style="s2">the visionary conflation of politics and</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.959" end="01:30:19.539" style="s2">morality you know that kind of the</p>

<p begin="01:30:38.499" end="01:30:42.340" style="s2">evil people and that will keep us safe</p>

<p begin="01:30:45.490" end="01:30:50.610" style="s2">but in fact the plutocracy is in the</p>

<p begin="01:30:50.610" end="01:30:56.920" style="s2">essentially to I mean really the same</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.920" end="01:31:02.290" style="s2">nice things essentially is because</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.280" end="01:31:04.030" style="s2">people are unable to manifest them</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.290" end="01:31:07.750" style="s2">already there&#39;s nothing stopping you</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.030" end="01:31:09.760" style="s2">essentially from I mean why does your</p>

<p begin="01:31:09.760" end="01:31:13.300" style="s2">why can&#39;t you privately organize around</p>

<p begin="01:31:13.300" end="01:31:18.130" style="s2">I mean we live generally in open enough</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.850" end="01:31:20.320" style="s2">societies that it really wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.130" end="01:31:22.450" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t matter even if you are run</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.320" end="01:31:25.690" style="s2">politically by idiots because you could</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.450" end="01:31:28.330" style="s2">organize your life essentially to</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.690" end="01:31:30.400" style="s2">completely avoid those structures well</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.330" end="01:31:33.630" style="s2">enough if you were able to actually</p>

<p begin="01:31:46.240" end="01:31:50.860" style="s2">better for the people that deserve more</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.460" end="01:31:53.650" style="s2">justice you know it&#39;s sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.860" end="01:32:01.500" style="s2">that will generally always tend towards</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.650" end="01:32:06.040" style="s2">the kind of creep of fascistic</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.500" end="01:32:07.210" style="s2">ideological you know and I mean that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.040" end="01:32:09.220" style="s2">know in the context of social justice</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.210" end="01:32:10.870" style="s2">because you have to understand the Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.220" end="01:32:14.050" style="s2">philosophy was really obsessed with</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.870" end="01:32:18.700" style="s2">social justice at its core this is you</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.050" end="01:32:21.850" style="s2">know that was their their proto-fascist</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.700" end="01:32:23.020" style="s2">ideology which basically infected all of</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.850" end="01:32:25.660" style="s2">Europe and America</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.020" end="01:32:27.970" style="s2">I mean people forget that how popular</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.660" end="01:32:29.500" style="s2">Hitler was before the wall before the</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.970" end="01:32:33.700" style="s2">war Hitler was pretty much the most</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.500" end="01:32:38.170" style="s2">popular leader in in Europe and and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.700" end="01:32:39.940" style="s2">know people forget why is because you</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.170" end="01:32:42.310" style="s2">know the kind of the liberal progressive</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.940" end="01:32:44.770" style="s2">vision which collected people in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.310" end="01:32:48.220" style="s2">Nuremberg rallies to destabilize far</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.770" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">more Germany you know basically the</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.220" end="01:32:51.730" style="s2">essentially the proto-feminist as well</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:53.770" style="s2">and all those people walking</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.730" end="01:32:55.270" style="s2">hand-in-hand wanting you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.770" end="01:32:56.950" style="s2">essentially the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.270" end="01:32:58.750" style="s2">fascist vision is that you would have</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.950" end="01:33:00.660" style="s2">basically a rainbow Hitler that sorts</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.750" end="01:33:05.830" style="s2">everything out</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.660" end="01:33:08.380" style="s2">but obviously identity and and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.830" end="01:33:11.140" style="s2">identity purity or whatever or or</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.380" end="01:33:13.720" style="s2">identity morality can only serve one</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.140" end="01:33:17.230" style="s2">master so you know there&#39;s only one ring</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.720" end="01:33:19.390" style="s2">to rule them all essentially you you the</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.230" end="01:33:22.200" style="s2">state can only serve one identity and</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.390" end="01:33:25.420" style="s2">you know identity is just such a</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.200" end="01:33:28.180" style="s2">pathetic philosophical vehicle and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.420" end="01:33:30.520" style="s2">instrument you know like yes you can fix</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.180" end="01:33:32.500" style="s2">everything according to to one identity</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.520" end="01:33:35.890" style="s2">but you know you&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.500" end="01:33:37.750" style="s2">fudge everything into into making the</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.890" end="01:33:39.460" style="s2">narrative work for that identity and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.750" end="01:33:42.690" style="s2">therefore you have to have this very</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.460" end="01:33:46.660" style="s2">stark and and caricature of reality</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.690" end="01:33:48.010" style="s2">serving that ideological you know spiral</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.660" end="01:33:50.800" style="s2">because it essentially is unsustainable</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.010" end="01:33:54.700" style="s2">and it creates a hyperrealism and you</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.800" end="01:33:56.560" style="s2">know we have this happening in our large</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.700" end="01:33:58.330" style="s2">level in terms of culture you know and</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.560" end="01:34:02.050" style="s2">the whole feminist thing is pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.330" end="01:34:03.250" style="s2">just sad even you know trolling and</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.050" end="01:34:05.530" style="s2">things like that although everything</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.250" end="01:34:10.660" style="s2">within his context can be fine</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.530" end="01:34:12.370" style="s2">the whole I mean one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.660" end="01:34:15.940" style="s2">made trolling attractive at the start</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.370" end="01:34:17.830" style="s2">was that it was a way to undermine the</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.940" end="01:34:20.290" style="s2">kind of brainless nurse by basically</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.830" end="01:34:23.170" style="s2">copying the brainless nests of certain</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.290" end="01:34:25.630" style="s2">ideologues essentially because there is</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.170" end="01:34:28.450" style="s2">almost so much race baiting and trolling</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.630" end="01:34:30.820" style="s2">based into identity politics and and</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.450" end="01:34:32.770" style="s2">that sort of activism and that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.820" end="01:34:34.690" style="s2">thinking and so it&#39;s sort of like you</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.770" end="01:34:37.530" style="s2">beat them by joining them by joining</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.690" end="01:34:41.830" style="s2">them and being stupid you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.530" end="01:34:46.510" style="s2">somewhat exemplify the era of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.830" end="01:34:49.270" style="s2">of particular slant of political lens</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.510" end="01:34:52.900" style="s2">you know and so in some sense I do think</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.270" end="01:34:54.460" style="s2">trolling has a dual function in that way</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.900" end="01:34:57.970" style="s2">because it sort of dilutes the efficacy</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.460" end="01:35:01.570" style="s2">of the kind of heuristic tactic in terms</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.970" end="01:35:05.020" style="s2">of culture it dilutes the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.570" end="01:35:07.300" style="s2">fascism which is but sadly that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.020" end="01:35:08.140" style="s2">ever go away unless properly until you</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.300" end="01:35:11.790" style="s2">sort of confront</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.140" end="01:35:14.050" style="s2">head on and you name it at its core and</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.790" end="01:35:18.010" style="s2">sadly I think that if we just try to</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.050" end="01:35:19.870" style="s2">fall into some kind of dicta and outline</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.010" end="01:35:22.480" style="s2">of the cultural space that the</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.870" end="01:35:24.940" style="s2">intellectual dark web provides that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.480" end="01:35:27.480" style="s2">not going to be good enough to save us</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.940" end="01:35:27.480" style="s2">from it</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.790" end="01:35:34.750" style="s2">and the core beliefs and the and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.970" end="01:35:36.850" style="s2">ethical ethos and getting that right</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.750" end="01:35:40.360" style="s2">will be the only ball walk will be the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.850" end="01:35:42.460" style="s2">only safety in fact and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.360" end="01:35:44.860" style="s2">problem that I have with with someone</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.460" end="01:35:47.800" style="s2">like Joe Rogan is that he essentially is</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.860" end="01:35:50.200" style="s2">is sort of nihilistic on this point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.800" end="01:35:52.270" style="s2">sort of beyond him he&#39;s somewhat at</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.200" end="01:35:54.670" style="s2">least he&#39;s fairly intellectually honest</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.270" end="01:35:56.620" style="s2">about that you know in terms of how you</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.670" end="01:35:58.840" style="s2">know he&#39;s at least articulates his</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.620" end="01:36:02.290" style="s2">assessment of it in a way where he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.840" end="01:36:05.410" style="s2">you know I&#39;m on this team or I&#39;m on that</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.290" end="01:36:07.480" style="s2">team you know he says you know where he</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.410" end="01:36:09.610" style="s2">he would prefer that one side to win but</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.480" end="01:36:11.770" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t you know pretend to be part</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.610" end="01:36:15.730" style="s2">of it you know so I think you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.770" end="01:36:18.250" style="s2">very honest in terms of transparency in</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.730" end="01:36:22.510" style="s2">terms of where he&#39;s at and and that I</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.250" end="01:36:26.280" style="s2">think you know he&#39;s not a bad actor but</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.510" end="01:36:29.020" style="s2">yeah my point is simply that he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.280" end="01:36:30.970" style="s2">you know not being a bad actor is is</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.020" end="01:36:33.250" style="s2">sort of helpful in the general context</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.970" end="01:36:34.900" style="s2">because it gives the room for good</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.250" end="01:36:37.870" style="s2">actors as well and he has certainly been</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.900" end="01:36:42.670" style="s2">helpful platform for people as I said</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.870" end="01:36:45.160" style="s2">factually he is every positive trend</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.670" end="01:36:46.840" style="s2">within the general culture but there is</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.160" end="01:36:49.570" style="s2">a difference between the meta discussion</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.840" end="01:36:52.030" style="s2">and and let&#39;s say the factual discussion</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.570" end="01:36:54.780" style="s2">and so yeah I&#39;m just trying to delineate</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.030" end="01:36:54.780" style="s2">these things</p>
