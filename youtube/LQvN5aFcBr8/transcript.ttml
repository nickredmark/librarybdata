<p begin="00:00:45.200" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">looked into this quite a bit myself for</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">a potential documentary for the bbc a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.640" style="s2">um and looked at your work um would you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">like to just start off by summarizing</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">your work</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:00:59.359" style="s2">um for people who maybe aren&#39;t familiar</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">with it it&#39;s a very big picture</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">yeah no i think the big picture is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">you know starting in 1980 which is when</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">the third edition of the diagnostic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:10.840" style="s2">statistical manual was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">published by the american psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.840" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">association starting in the united</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">states but then it expanded</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">we got a narrative that was told to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">public and our societies organized</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">themselves around the narrative which we</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">were told was scientific and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.600" style="s2">narrative is quite simple</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">is that they had this they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">discovering that these are brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">diseases these are brain illnesses</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">anxiety psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">and most important that it seemed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">they were due to chemical imbalances in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">and that the drugs we had fix those</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">chemical imbalances like insulin for</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">diabetes that&#39;s the story we were sold</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a story of great scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">progress when you think about it right</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">think about how complex the brain is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">human brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">and they had identified the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">molecule that causes madness depression</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">anxiety and they could fix it if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">so i&#39;d say that&#39;s the greatest discovery</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">maybe scientific history given the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">complexity of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">and then we heard you know then we got</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">stories about these new drugs that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">so much better than the first generation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">psychiatric drugs prozac of course was</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">the first but we got new antipsychotics</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">and with that narrative our use of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">reversal diagnoses expanded but our use</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">of psychiatric drugs just expanded first</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">and by the way to people of all ages i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">mean we started</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">medicating our kids to our elderly</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">people and initially there was some</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">resistance in europe to medicating the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">kids and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2">but gradually this story took hold</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">really around the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">now my work i think in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">writ large is this is to say is it true</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">it does and by the way not from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">critics does their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">scientific literature um</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">support that story so and what you find</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">is that the chemical imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">theory was always a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">so for example we&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">depression is due to um</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">too little serotonin and it drugs up</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">serotonin okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">well you can go back and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">that hypothesis really arises in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">1960s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">and you can see by 1984 the nimh is</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">listen we&#39;re just not finding that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">people who are depressed</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">have low serotonin and then in 1998 the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">american psychiatric association&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">textbook says you know the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">imbalance theory was</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">a pretty um naive</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">theory in the first place it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you know there was really no</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">that the cause of a problem should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">the opposite of the drug&#39;s mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">and they said it&#39;s gone it didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t confirm it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">and you can go kenneth candler in 2004</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">he was a world leader in investigating</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">says hey we&#39;ve hunted for these chemical</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">imbalances we haven&#39;t found them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">literature but that&#39;s not what was being</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">told to the public</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">and that includes by the american</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">psychiatric association now that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">first part you can and so you see this</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">this narrative of progress starts to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">so the irony the real irony of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">chemical imbalance story is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">in scientific terms a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">the whole theory arose because of an</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">understanding of how the drugs acted on</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">how they perturbed normal functioning</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">and what they found is that before</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">people went on the drugs they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">have any characteristic chemical</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">but they found that once you go on these</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">drugs they induce</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">a physiological change opposite of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">drug&#39;s mechanism of an action</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">that is the very thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">hypothesized to cause say psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">or depression in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what the science showed and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">is so amazing is you see this worry</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">all the way back to the 70s and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">worry that antidepressants</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">actually were depressogenic agents uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">over the long term that you can trace</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">that back to the 80s but especially then</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very long-winded answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">david to say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">in simple terms we as a society have</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">organized ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">around this narrative of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">now uh you know i&#39;m not a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">i didn&#39;t do the research but you can go</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">and look at that research and you find</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">scientific story</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">is quite different okay and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">unfortunately what you find over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">long term again and again is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">that we are worsening</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">the natural course of these disorders</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">over the long term in the aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking now specifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">because of the news about jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:07.319" style="s2">and he just put out a video yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">um talking about his history with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.319" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">and warning people not to take them for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">more than two weeks that this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.440" style="s2">that he&#39;s very worried about those drugs</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">can you talk specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.440" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">benzodiazepines in this context what</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">how do they work and how does the brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:24.160" style="s2">kind of compensate</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">why is it so dangerous to be taking them</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">for for a length of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">yeah the benzel story is really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">doctors have known these drugs for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">long time shouldn&#39;t be taken long</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">two or three weeks so that&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">new knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">that became like the official</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">recommendation in 1980</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">uh here&#39;s here&#39;s the thing so when we</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">talk about serotonin and dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re basically excitatory</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">neurons excitatory um</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">neurotransmitters what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">you have a presynaptic neuron right</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">and it releases and let&#39;s say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">dopaminergic neuron it releases that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">it binds with receptors on the so this</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">is the presynaptic neuron the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">postsynaptic neuron</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">and since it&#39;s an excitatory neuron it</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">causes this neuron to fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s how messages are passed</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">but the brain at the same think of a car</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">has an accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">it also has a break right and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">how you sort of maintain</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">brain function because you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">molecules that can excite things so they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">get molecules that can acquire things</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">well the molecule that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">quiets things the main molecules called</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">gaba and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">so what happens is it with a with a gaba</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">neurotransmitter it it it inhibits the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">firing of the second neuron it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">less likely to fire so it&#39;s a quieting</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">so what a benzodiazepine does is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">amps up the gaba system it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">slamming the brake on on</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">on neuronal activity so that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">you know that&#39;s why um you know your</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">you know you feel relaxed or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">care your anxiety goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s because the the benzo when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">first take it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">is quieting your your your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">your brain in essence and your whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">and this is why also if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">too many pencils you&#39;ll stop breathing</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">um so what what is again so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">so this is your braking system right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">you go into benzo</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">and benzo is amplifying gaba</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">it it gets into the gaba receptors so it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">acts as a gaba substitute</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">so your brain goes ah i&#39;m doing too much</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">inhibit inhibition there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">inhibitory of of my regular functioning</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">so it starts</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">reducing its uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">gaba receptors and its own production of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">gaba</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">so think about this it&#39;s the normal</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">right now what you do is with the drug</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">press harder on that break all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re putting your foot down</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">but the brain&#39;s own braking mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">starts becoming less effective okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">so now go off your benzo</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">right what do you got you&#39;ve lost your</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">braking system</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">or it&#39;s become diminished so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">for example you hear people coming off</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">how i&#39;ve got these weird skin</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">sensations and all these things is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">because your neurons are firing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">like crazy out of control because you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">you have at the very least lessened</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">that natural braking system now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">other thing that people don&#39;t realize so</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">i take a benzo for four weeks now i can</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">either go off</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">i can keep on many people keep on well</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">the best long-term studies we have show</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">that over the long term even if you stay</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">on your</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">uh benzo you&#39;re more likely to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">anxious okay it&#39;s like the drug because</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">of this whole change in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">system it starts losing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">the speculums speculation so even if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">stay on you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">if you do comparison between a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">that never took it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">and one that stayed on you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">the group continually on will have more</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.079" style="s2">anxiety more panic episodes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">more likely to be start you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.079" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">agoraphobia</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">you know all these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">associate with it so</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">long long to summarize all this</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s some evidence you can use these</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">drugs for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">with some effectiveness and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">in difficult times</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">but beyond that you&#39;re getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">place where it&#39;s quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re setting yourself up for</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">difficult times</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">uh trouble getting off and if you stay</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">on um</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">more emotional problems and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">cognitive uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">impairments too yeah i remember reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">your work and it just seems so clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">that because the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">is a an adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s adapting to this perturbations that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">you&#39;re having from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">from not just benzos but all all</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">psychiatric drugs</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">and then especially if you&#39;re taking it</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">for anxiety and your brain is then</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">effectively kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">um ramping up the the receptors for</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">anxiety when you&#39;re coming off them</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">you are then super super sensitized for</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">the very thing that you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">dull down in the first place one thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">ask you about because i&#39;ve seen jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">peterson and his daughter talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">that he was prescribed it for a food</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">allergy</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">and then increasingly over over time</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">developed what he described as a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">unusual</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">reaction to to benzos where they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">actually making him more anxious rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">than less</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">and from what i understand from your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">work at least that&#39;s not actually that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">unusual to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">that you once over time you start to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">actually become</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">become more and more sensitized to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">very thing that you&#39;re trying to block</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">what would you how would you reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">that no i think you just got it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">no i i mean this is part of the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">of this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">that you come there for some short</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">relief</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">and short-term relief but you&#39;re setting</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">yourself up if you stay on these very</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">long for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">for a difficult process either the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">difficult thing of coming off</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">or just as you said because the brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">has changed</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">more everyday anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">there there is a a mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">explains it and the mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">you&#39;re is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:41.160" style="s2">is you&#39;re taking away the brain&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">braking system</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.160" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">physiologically and i don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">so the brain&#39;s trying to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">homeostatic equilibrium right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">trying to put its</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">break it so you go on a benzo as to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">braking system</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re pressing down harder on</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">the braking system and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">the braking system itself sort of dims</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">force and you think that&#39;s a that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">equilibrium so maybe if i just stay on</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">the drug this will be a new way for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">brain to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">act but it seems like the brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">that compensatory system actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">becomes a bit dysfunctional as much as</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that you really reach a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">but as opposed to a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">you know new eq a new way of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">like one foot on the brake one for an</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">and it seems like it leads over time to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">sort of a dysfunctionality</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">so you see like often more psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">in psychotic patients on antipsychotics</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">long term</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s thought because that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">this the brain is becoming so super</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">sensitive to dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s now in this abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">state with depression the idea is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">drives your brain into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">look actually a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">dysfunctional serotonergic state</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">so benzo if you continually take it it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">probably driving your gaba system which</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">is your braking system</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">into a dysfunctional state i mean in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this immediate effort for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">brain to maintain a homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">but it seems that it&#39;s such a stressor</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">on the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">it becomes to become it tends to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">less functional over time</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">and i i think this metaphor can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">illuminate this in a little way so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">get in your car okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">so so go ahead and get in your car foot</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">put</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">start to drive put one foot on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">accelerator okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">and now as you start driving put your</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">other foot on the brake and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">you decide to go down the road okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re using both systems and now drive</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">your car like that for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">is it going to be it&#39;s going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">effective functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">you know systems wear out is what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">if that makes sense i i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">to explain how over time</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">you&#39;re getting these this these signs of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve already kind of hinted at it</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">but i&#39;d like to broaden this out a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">um why i think this is such a vitally</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">important conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">is sort of the wider issue of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">biatrogenic</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">damage which is the word that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">damage caused by medical interventions</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">and i&#39;ve heard a few people contact of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">mine talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">iatrogenic plague what i understand is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">that when people often go on to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">psychiatric drug</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">and they then have these side effects</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">it&#39;s then often attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">the condition that they originally</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">presented with</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">but they are often then in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.759" style="s2">system of a different cocktail of drugs</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">moving from one to the other and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">all have quite they can all</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">collectively have quite damaging effects</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">can you talk about that sort of catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">situation that people find themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">and how that plays out just in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">a bigger picture well in a way i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve summarized it quite good</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">it&#39;s quite well um that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">uh so you you start down this path okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">and often</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">you get down this path with just a mild</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">problem right</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">you come in you have a mild problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for maybe you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">divorced or you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">lost a job or something has happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not sleeping and so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">start down this path where</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">your brain is going to be changed by a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">drug</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">and as we were discussing earlier very</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">often it</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">poops out the positive effect that sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">of control of the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">poops out over time right so what</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">happens when it poops out</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">do you blame and and maybe new symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">are coming up</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t working he&#39;d been on</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">any number of drugs it all started when</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">he broke up with his girlfriend like</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">when he&#39;s 20 years old</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:55.200" style="s2">but that&#39;s part of the um</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">narrative that really is a uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.200" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">misleads the public with that when</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">people when you see people deteriorate</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">on these medications long term</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s blamed to the disease even though</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">natural course of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">and in that way they preserve they</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">preserve the image of the drugs as as</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.679" style="s2">you know as helpful and all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">get assigned to the disease</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">but there&#39;s no evidence for that and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">and david one thing i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">really important here</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">what&#39;s the natural course of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">problems because</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">in order to assess whether a drug is</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">doing harm</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">over the long term okay or providing a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">benefit</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:36.799" style="s2">you have to know the natural course what</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">is the natural capacity to recover</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.799" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">so what is the long-term course your</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">drug in order to be beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">has to beat that natural recovery rate</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">the natural recovery rate from</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">depression is 80 which by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">what it used to be called and and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">two years later let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">80 are not depressed okay for your drug</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">beneficial over two years you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">have a recovery rate of like 85</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">and but you don&#39;t see that you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">like well actually the recovery rate on</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">antidepressants is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">but in the best long in a in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">long-term studies we had in the united</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">states you know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">stay well rate was at the end of one</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">in real clinical settings and one it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">three percent</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">and and the other was about uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">it was about six percent</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">and as the the researchers said these</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">are astonishingly</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">low um you know stay well rates and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">they did those studies they said</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">these are real world studies we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">going to be doing these pharma-funded</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">studies where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to pick a select group of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">now at the same time but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">so what are you doing you&#39;re taking the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">natural recovery rate and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">lowering it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s the way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">this it&#39;s not that everybody does poorly</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">on their drugs but what are you doing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">outcomes in the aggregate and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">optimistic part of this whole story is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">if we go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">it&#39;s recovery rates in the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">from an episode of depression</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">an episode of anxiety anxiety in</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">particular was seen as</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">transient um or even psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">we&#39;re so often seen as episodic you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">get through it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">and when we talk about depression as</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">episode we&#39;re talking about people got</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">hospitalized for depression we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">talking about this walking around</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">hospitalized depression clinical</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">depression and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">even hospitalized patients about 80</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">percent would be well within one year</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">and they they did a modern study on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">and they said what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">recovery rate for depression in modern</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">times okay they finally did this</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">in the absence of drugs you know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">the recovery weight was at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">one year 85</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">so in the medicated arm it was like 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">in the in the in the unmedicated arm it</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">was like 85</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">and if you read that story the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">researchers go wow really be hard for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">drug</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">to beat this recovery yeah i just</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">wonder if you could summarize</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">quite briefly just what you think are</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">the most damning statistics</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">or the most kind of compelling evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">for the damage that&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">of of the of these drugs well in anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">of an epidemic what i did is i just</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">looked at as a marker of disability okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">so i looked at the number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">were ending up on government disability</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">due to mental illness okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">now that&#39;s the extreme end right they</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">can no longer work</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">well in 1987 we had about 1.25 million</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">adults</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">on disability due to mental illness okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">then we get this that&#39;s when prozac</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">comes to market we get this explosion in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">the use of drugs</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">and now today it&#39;s around five million</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">adults on disability united states and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s gone up in every country</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">i can find</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">that embrace this story and the use of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">antidepressants and all</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">uh like in the uk um</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">nor you know in any scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">countries australia new zealand you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">it over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">the second thing is like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">happening to the kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">so you see with this increasing use of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">psychiatric drugs the mental health of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">kids is deteriorating</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">in the united states something like well</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">first of all just on disability</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">in 1987 when prozac came to market we</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">had 16 000 kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">whose families or guardians received a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">payment because the kid was dis</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">the child was disabled by mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s something like seven or eight</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">hundred thousand now</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s like uh what is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:47.960" style="s2">a 40 time increase 40 fold increase</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">and if you look at kids who end up</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.960" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">psychiatrized</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">and sort of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.039" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">if they end up on disability two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">go on to uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">adult disability when they turn age 18.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">but the most amazing thing is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">50 of american students now</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">seek mental health during their four</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">years of college</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">so i see this disability like the canary</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">in the cold ma</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">coal mine in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a marker of harm done</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">but all the markers suicide&#39;s gone up</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">like 20 years in a row in the united</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">um the burden of depression globally has</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">increased dramatically and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">saying it&#39;s only due to the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">but all the markers of psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">distress and developed societies have</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">basically gone</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">up in the last uh 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s on just um if we just see this</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">as a story of a medical failure okay if</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">we just look at this through a medical</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">lens</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">the larger failure is this is also a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">story of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">because think about what the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">imbalance story is telling you</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of telling you that these</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">chemicals in your brain control you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re sort of the the robot to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">these master chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">and it takes away a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">of responsibility for oneself right</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s not your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">whereas if you have a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">philosophy and the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">is listen to suffer is to be human</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be anxious we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">depressed sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">and even to go a bit mad is not all that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">unusual especially if you stop sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">but if we have like an older style of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">that first of all we have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">you know if we look at as a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">you see in novels and shakespeare and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">we understand that humans suffer we also</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">understand that the human mind is not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">pleasant place sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a difficult place</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">that becomes your philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">understanding what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">it ain&#39;t easy growing up ain&#39;t easy so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">when you suffer you&#39;re depressed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">grieving</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">okay and you&#39;re a bit crazy that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">are at the same time we understand in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">that philosophy we understand we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">responsive to our environment that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">you need to change your environment</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s on a an individual level how</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">about a social level how do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">healthy population</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">well we know you try to create a more</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">equal society a fairer society you try</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">to make sure people have good housing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">health care that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">so the biggest tragedy in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">view is this we as a society and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">happened in societies around the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;re told a false story now it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">pitched to us as a story of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">science and we organized our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">our sense of self or expectations of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">around that false around that story</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">and yet when you dig into that story you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">find it&#39;s best understood as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">marketing story a commercially story</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">commercial story it&#39;s serving</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">financial interests the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">power interests the prestige of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">medical specialty</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s doing extraordinary harm to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">society it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">we have more people becoming disabled</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">you have so many people feel that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">they never live their full lives because</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">their emotions were muted</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">and the biggest thing for me is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">sense of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">because it robs us of our sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">can be resilient human beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">and also look at shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">look at your bible humans you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">very emotional creatures and and i just</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">think it gives us a false</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">philosophy as well and that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">tragedy in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really interesting i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the sort of the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">reductive scientific materialism</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">like yeah we&#39;re constantly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">reducing everything down to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">and if you would and and also the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">realization that we&#39;re so much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a reductionistic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">the psyche as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">by reducing the psyche to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">measurable</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">bits and pieces we&#39;re just we&#39;ve we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">eviscerating the idea of being human and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">this is one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">consequences of that kind of world view</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">i&#39;d love to go into that into that more</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">but i um</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">maybe maybe towards the end because a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">couple of things i&#39;d like to to just</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">move the conversation on to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">the question of the media and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">incentive structures</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">and why is this story not being told i</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">remember reading your book and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">looking at other books and this topic as</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">well and just feeling incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">um angry at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">like the level of harm that is caused by</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">just the level of silence that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">um on the part of of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">of the media and on the part of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">the the the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">how is that maintained how is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">of this this story maintained</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good question and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">uh it seems hard to imagine that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">could have been maintained as well as it</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple things the media</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really know the science right</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">because you really have to dig into this</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">you have to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">science us how drugs are tested how you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">can uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">bias trials by design you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">you also have to read the whole studies</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t just read the abstract so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">the first problem is even science</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">reporters</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">generally don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">this literature not really okay what</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">they know</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">is what the people they interview tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">you know which are academic</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">psychiatrists and all right</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">um so why don&#39;t we know this story</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">one is because american psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">closed ranks in the night early 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">and said this is the story we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">to tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">and they even had training workshops</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:24.000" style="s2">where they taught</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">psychiatrists to tell this story and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">idea was</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">psychiatry in the 70s was sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">discipline and disrepute or</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">fearing for its survival and if they put</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.919" style="s2">on the white coat</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">both literally and metaphorically or</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.919" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">figuratively</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">they could now present themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the image of infectious</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">disease doctors</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">remember how celebrated infectious</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.840" style="s2">disease doctors are because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">we know we&#39;ve minimized with infectious</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.840" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">disease with the arrival of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">antibiotics you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">anyway they decided and you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">you can really see this psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">decided to tell a story in 1980 these</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">are brain illnesses therefore we&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">doctors</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">our drugs are good and really we if</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">these are illnesses it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">help to say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">talk therapy is good right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">medical illnesses and what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">with medical illnesses you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">you have a drug and who can prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">drugs that&#39;s psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing the second</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">who really loved this story</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">pharmaceutical companies because now</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take all these</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">ills that human beings that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">get it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">pass a drug for unhappiness okay you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">pass a drug for a medical condition</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">called anxiety or depression</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">so they&#39;re going to take all these ills</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">that human beings suffer all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">it&#39;s you know beyond the asylum and now</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">they&#39;re going to make them diseases and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going to open up the market</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">so what happened you see that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">pharmaceutical companies start paying</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">academic psychiatrists to be their</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">advisors consultants</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">you know that sort of thing uh speakers</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">advisors consultants</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">now and i&#39;m talking about a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">so what did the pharmaceutical thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">companies think they were doing when</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">they were hiring these academic</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">they thought they were building markets</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">in other words</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">what did the academic psychiatrist start</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">thinking i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">brilliant i&#39;m a world expert that i</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">deserve five hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">for going on a speaking tour doing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">research or consulting</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">and you know the old thing it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">convince a man of anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">or a person of anything if it goes</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">against their financial well-being</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">the actual sentiment is much more</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">concise than that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">um once the profession</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">said to themselves this is the story</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">we&#39;re going to tell they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">start believing that story</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">and their and and and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">start seeing whatever bits of science</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">that can support that story that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;re going to go on</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">to and they&#39;re going to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">either ignore</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">or discount or even keep out of their</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">journals some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">stuff that challenged that and what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">see quite clearly in american</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">psychiatric history those psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">who broke with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">and wanted to publish other types of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">research they got killed</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">by killed i mean their their careers</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">went down the tubes so that became a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">clear message that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">are going from psychiatry supported by</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">uh pharmaceutical money</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna tell this story and okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;re committed to this story</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna believe it after a while</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s the first part of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">meeting the second part is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:40.559" style="s2">they came up with a great strategy in</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">the basic in the late 80s early 90s to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.559" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">discredit the critics</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">because unfortunately one very visible</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">critic was scientology</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">you know they started cchr and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">scientology is clearly a cult right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">what happened was whenever critics came</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">and you can even see this in documents</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a planning how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">so in the early 1990s there was a worry</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">that antidepressants increase the risk</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">because once that is then presented to</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">and they would throw it at anybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">basically that you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">stood up and criticized so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">brilliant public relations thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">say that people you know and they would</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">say all these people criticizing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">they&#39;re flat earthers</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">so they they managed as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">that became the organizing narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">critics of psychiatry critics of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">drugs</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">are flat earthers they&#39;re non-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">people they&#39;re members of a cult</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">now once that was in place now it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s diminishing but that was in place</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">in the 1990s and early 2000s when this</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">narrative really took hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">now i&#39;m an editor and i say david</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">go out and do a story i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">come back and hear that like</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">uh these drugs don&#39;t you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">they&#39;re increasing suicide or</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t work over the long</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">term and then i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">you&#39;re the reporter i&#39;m going to go like</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">this is going to get people stop taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">the drugs if you report something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be doing harm and and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">just became like and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">how many editors haven&#39;t yet reporters</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">ended up taking the drugs themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">because once you move into that for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">while you&#39;re going to be a believer</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">anyway long story short is that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">were a lot of storytelling influences</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">that made it difficult for critics</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">and there was a lot of money and power</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">and prestige behind the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">conventional narrative yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">i find it really interesting we there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">another person we&#39;ve had on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">quite a bit called eric weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">who talks about the he he</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">he&#39;s called some he&#39;s come up with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">term the disc</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">the distributed information suppression</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">and i think yeah i think it fits</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">perfectly with this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">he basically describes how in many</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">different areas of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">many different institutions they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">coalesce around certain narratives for</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">prestige and financial and other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">incentive structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">and then anyone who deviates from that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">is like taken out</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">he calls it the platter of plomo so</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">you&#39;re either bought off or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">dispatched that it comes from the i</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">what&#39;s his name escobar used to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">keep people in line in medellin and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">colombia by</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">either bribery or or assassination and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">he talks about this in i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">one of the the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">obvious examples of how that system</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">works that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">that i&#39;ve seen yeah i i that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">exactly what happened that&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">way to summarize it</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">yeah and you know what&#39;s brilliant about</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">this is you can see the incentives i</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">and you can see who benefits from this</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">why you would have this sort of uh you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">know thing in operation</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a brilliant i love that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">acronym too that&#39;s a great acronym</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">and what what drives you in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">what why why are you sort of plowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">this furrow and have you felt</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">it a bit of a lonely battle over the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">um there are elements of loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure there are also uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">elements of great reward</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">and the reward comes from um</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">this counter narrative let&#39;s call it a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">counter narrative that i&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">accepted</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s growing okay and it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">inroads even into</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">you know journals and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">psychiatric journals</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">so there is some reward uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">for pursuing a counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">that even as time goes by gets stronger</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">not weaker</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">like new evidence just continues to come</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">that supports your the counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">and and revealing the falseness of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">you know of the convention there so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something rewarding about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve had so many many many many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">write me and say ah now i understand my</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">i got i got screwed up on these drugs</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">uh and and many now so often it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">to get off these drugs okay but i know</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">many people have and they feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">got their lives back</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s rewarding to be part</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.040" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">an underdog battle right david versus</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.839" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">afflicted</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">and here you feel so often you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">comforting the afflicted</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">and afflicting the comfort and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">pretty great</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">i mean it fits with sort of meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">journalism</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">and you know when we we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">whole philosophy i just think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">important it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">big story of how it&#39;s changed our</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">society how we raise our kids and all</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">that so all that makes it meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">the hard part is you feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">making a little bit of progress</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">things are getting into this like uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">journals but</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">nothing is really changing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">people still getting diagnosed left and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">right people still putting</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">on drugs left and right kids still being</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">put on the drugs left and right</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">and so the the weariness is am i just</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">banging my head on those swamps</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">and i sort of been at this now like 20</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.839" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m more convinced than ever</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">that the conventional narrative is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">false narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">as shown in their own literature um</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">if you go back to madden america there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">sort of predictions</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">that uh in both of those books</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">okay there&#39;s the conventional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">here&#39;s the counter narrative we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">to see which ones</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">what is the data that is generated in</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">the next year is going gonna show us</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">and in both cases it was the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">counter narrative that actually played</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">out in as new data</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">came in now you might say wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">you know wow that was good predictive</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">powers</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it&#39;s what the science that had</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">been done to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">time was predicting you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">there was 40 years of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">of research sort of saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">taking that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">and and sort of you know why should</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">things change if</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re still doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">sort of thing you&#39;re perturbing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s an important battle i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a battle so meaningful to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">dave and goliath battles are good but</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s where it&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">and and you wish</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also a little heartbreaking you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">know what i mean like i i</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">when i heard the story from this guy who</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">just i lost my life</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">and i just broke up with a girl it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">you know those and then i&#39;ll get you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">know i&#39;ll get emails from parents who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">lost their kids and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s hard a lot of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">and i&#39;d just love to to close by</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">returning to the piece you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">the philosophy because i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">such an important piece</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">of the sort of the reductionistic idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">and it reminds me a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">michael pollan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">work i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">with his yeah so he did</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">he did a book called how to change your</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">mind about psychedelic therapies</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">but before that he actually i was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">fan of his stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">for his food work and i think it was in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">defense of food he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">the ideology of nutritionism</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">like the the kind of the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">can break all the foods down and we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:16.319" style="s2">understand them just through kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">vitamins and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.319" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">they would they were just effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">kind of vitamin and carb and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">fat delivery systems and he said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem a lot of our diet</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">with a lot of our understanding of diet</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">because we&#39;re not we&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.760" style="s2">things holistically</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">and he said it was a wonderful line he</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.760" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">said who knows what transpires in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">soul of a carrot</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of sort of natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">mysticism of the or a mysticism of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">natural world in his work of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">of like we if we if we start to break</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">things apart</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">and try to fix them um in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">in very reductionistic terms we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">missing the essence of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">of this the living system and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">real problem and i see that so much in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">uh in in psychiatry and in in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">the medical model of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">in particular i&#39;d love to hear you just</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">talk a little bit more about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">philosophy aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">yeah um it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">it it it starts from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">mechanistic view of human beings right</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">and and of course medicine did advance</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">in many ways from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">mechanistic point of view you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">understood the heart and these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.040" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">at the same time i think medicine as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.040" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">whole has faltered for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">because they&#39;re not seeing that these</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">holistic you know these</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not just a heart we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">this system we&#39;re not just that system</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">that all these things are interrelated i</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">talking physically now right i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">even getting in so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">into the brain um but now add in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">and now adding consciousness now and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">unbelievable ability to feel and know</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">and know a little bit about your mind at</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">least the conscious part</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">i think if you go through human history</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">that we can and and people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">societies are trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">themselves and they tell stories about</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">like how we got here and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">what is our relationship to nature and</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">and god and all there&#39;s a mystery to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a profundity to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a recognition of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a recognition of sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">here is that each of us is a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">we need to be humble as we try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">understand each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">understand ourselves understand our</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">place in nature</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">and i think that philosophy by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">helps breed uh a sense of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">to yourself but also a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">um empathy towards other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">also a sense of societies need each</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">so in other words um out of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">uh out of this holistic vision of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">um we&#39;re not just islands you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">we&#39;re more like a bee culture so to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">speak if you understand what i mean here</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">in other words</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t exist alone we exist in</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">ecological niches and societies that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s what and that&#39;s a sort of view</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">of life you get by</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">reading history reading the bible</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">reading religious tracts reading</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">reading novels that&#39;s what you see right</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">and now it&#39;s almost like with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">mechanistic this reductionist point of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">view we lose all that we lose that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.920" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">knowledge that lore that sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">that sense of society and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">oh the problem it&#39;s in you david you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">depressed</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">uh something wrong with your head it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s like the most impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">philosophy imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">and it and it&#39;s an impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">becomes a hindrance to creating a more</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">just society</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">of being a more loving society of being</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">a more forgiving society</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">embracing diversity right embracing</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">people who are different</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">so i i think if if</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">we go back to this sense of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">and what&#39;s loss</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">the biggest loss is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s an impoverishment of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">it&#39;s an impoverished philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">if a person has that sense of self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">just such um</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like you lose yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">if that makes sense because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">saying ah</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">this you know all my problems are in my</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">uh it&#39;s some sort of chemistry i i just</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine if i were going to raise</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">a kid i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">think of any philosophy i would want</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">them not to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">and any sort of history the training</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i would not want</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">them to think about society themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">others and that sort of thing so if</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">if we could have a society where we</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">could just get rid of this narrative</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">and sort of revisit literature</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">history would be a healthier society</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">rebel wisdom was set up to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">the world at a deeper level than the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">it was built for these times of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">and change</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">which is why we want to do what we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">to meet the challenge of the times</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">more films and also for our rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">weekly sense making calls with our</p>
