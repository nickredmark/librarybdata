<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">interesting topics and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">immediately stood out to me was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">the topic of perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">perspective seeking</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">so um danny i have a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">uh personal question as well like</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">what&#39;s your what&#39;s your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">seeking approach like how do you come</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">to believe what you&#39;re believing right</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">well the reason that this came up as we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">were starting to dialogue was you said</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">that you were thinking of calling the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">podcast perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">it feels valuable since that&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">central theme to what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">here to actually explore that topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t mind me switching roles</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">why did you want to do a podcast on</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">perspectives oh</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">distinctively i&#39;ve talked oftentimes i</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">shared your content oftentimes with</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">with people your podcast uh on forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">thinkers is probably one of the podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">i shared the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">uh in the past and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">this i i get this trickling feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">excitement when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">something that i feel is is is growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">me is is challenging me is expanding my</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">perspective because it&#39;s changing my</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">experience how</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">how i interact with my environment and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">i feel it in a way where i feel more</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">positive about the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">i i engage with my environment and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m so excited to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">to hear different perspectives and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">in that process i&#39;m learning with every</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">new perspective that i</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">that i that i hear that i experience i</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">something that um is i think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">i consider the path my personal path of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">is i&#39;m realizing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not only me my perspective is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">the only relevant one</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">is not the only right one and the more i</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">experience that i feel the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">the healthier i live the happier i</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">am and so that that&#39;s why i care so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">about perspectives and exploring</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">yeah well the fact that you say you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">happier is you&#39;re exposed to more</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">perspectives even if they&#39;re ones that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">uh invalidate previous views you had or</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">at least show the inadequacy of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">is a really healthy psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">because if every time you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">your previous best understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">world was really inadequate you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">badly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">then it will end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">having you want to do confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">and look for things that confirm what</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">you currently think and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s going to limit the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">obviously what you can understand about</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">reality and how effective you can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">in acting on it so there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">there&#39;s an epistemic drive right</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">epistemology meaning how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">knowing stuff there&#39;s an epistemic drive</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">that can have its own incentive where</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">there is a like you mentioned like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">joy or an aliveness just from coming to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">understand something better</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">and when that becomes stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">fragile identity structure wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">seen as already having it figured out</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">then the rate of learning obviously goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">up quite a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">so i&#39;m happy for us to start by</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">exploring the topic of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">because we would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">whatever other topic we were exploring</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">we&#39;d be exploring it through</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">um so it&#39;s valuable to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">process by which we look right</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">perspective even though</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">the word is from optical science is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">looking at the world and the key</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">kind of insight the first insight is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:40.639" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">when i&#39;m looking at something and i have</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.639" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">a perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not what what i&#39;m seeing is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">actually the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">because if i went to the other side i</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">would see something else and if i zoomed</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">in with a microscope or if i looked in</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">the ultraviolet spectrum or with a radio</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">telescope or i would see something else</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">so i&#39;m getting a perspective i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">some bandwidth of light bouncing off of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">one side of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">with some error or whatever coming in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">certain resolution into my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">and so one very valuable insight is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">in the process of perceiving something</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">inherently reduces the total information</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">so my perspective on something is never</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">actually the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">right and i need many i need to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">many many different perspectives to even</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">start to get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">so of course if i&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">building from the west side or the east</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">side or the north side or from an aerial</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">view or inside one room or inside</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">another room</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">they&#39;re all true and they&#39;re all partial</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">and if i tried to hold it as if well</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">which one is it that would make no sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s not a 2d object right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">this very complex 3d object with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">internal structure and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">so they&#39;re all true they&#39;re all partial</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">and but if i&#39;m trying to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">a complex 3d thing to 2d right to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">single perspective that i can take a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">picture of it&#39;s just going to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">it&#39;ll have some truth value in it but to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">the degree that i think it&#39;s adequate</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a whole dimension wrong which</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">is infinitely wrong right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">infinity of another dimension missing</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">we do this with our perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">social topics or</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">other people or the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">and so then even if i take</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">all of the pictures and i say okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">going to take as many pictures as i can</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">and of course i can never</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">show that i took every perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">maybe i didn&#39;t get under the table and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">have a look at what maybe a kid sees</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">in their view of the house their main</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">memory might be that view from under the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">table when they think of the house right</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">or uh whatever i miss the aerial view</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">never show</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">closure over the perspective space i</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">won&#39;t say never for the most part in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">reality you can never show closure over</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">and then even if i take a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">pictures it&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">representation i put them in as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">collage in 2d that&#39;s still not what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">house looks like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s still not 2d so then i</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">could sew them together into a video and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">i take a video tour of the house right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">well i still don&#39;t see the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">at once</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">but i added another dimension back in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">that which is time</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">right the video is showing over time so</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">i have i have 2d and then i have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">connection of all these 2d images</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">through the flow of time and now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">back at the right kind of dimensionality</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">and so i can get a sense of more</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">adequate kind of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.839" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">so when i was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">young i noticed that when people were</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">arguing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">about political topics or philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">um that there was usually a dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">kind of thing going on where there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">some truth value</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">and some inadequacy to explain all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">the other truth values but they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">they were seeing the west side of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">house or the east side and be</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">they were over emphasizing the part that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">felt most real and meaningful to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">based on the perspective of the reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">they had</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">and and so how to be able to seek</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">to see through the other perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">and then speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">higher not higher perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t get your perspective right how</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">do you seek a higher</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">trans perspective synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">um this is something that like this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">philosophy 101 right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">the hegelian dialectic what is it take a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">particular view on something</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">and postulate it you have a thesis and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">then find something that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">almost the exact opposite view but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">some people believe in and you have an</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">those will usually be at a similar level</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">of complexity right similar number</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">if i if i tried to express the view</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">under maximum information compression</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;d be similar-ish</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">um and so this can look like</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">the debates that you see around</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">capitalism and communism</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">or similarly around uh the democratic or</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">republican or generally left or right</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">kind of political platforms</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">which can often be thought of as having</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">to do with more emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">on the collective and the whole or more</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">emphasis on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">right rights and responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">various things like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">but they actually don&#39;t it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">there is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">a gradient with zero and negative and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">positive numbers and you find the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">place between rights and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">it&#39;s that there&#39;s actually perpendicular</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">axes</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">and that you can increase rights and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">responsibilities at the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">time but it&#39;s in a higher dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">space right you kind of have to get that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">higher dimensionality right otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">will default to thinking the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">is being automatically threatened right</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">their perspective also encodes a value</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">there is something that they value</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">within that thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">that perspective and then they might</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">kind of vehemently oppose or not want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">hear another perspective because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">seems like if</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">that one is held as true it&#39;s this one</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">is true or that one is true and if that</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">then it will invalidate the value here</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">as opposed to the synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">is actually a higher order of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">you under maximum compression of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">good statement of it there would be more</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">and it&#39;ll end up including the true</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">parts of each of these and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">how they relate what the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">feedback cycles</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">for the higher perspective so thesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">synthesis but the synthesis is not of</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">right it is a includes and transcends</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">now i must say there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">who hate hegelian dialectics</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">because particularly there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">empirically or poparian oriented people</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">because a dialectic has been abused</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">as a tool for manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">uh but it&#39;s like every tool can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">right so the fact that i can beat</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">somebody to death with a hammer doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">mean a hammer has no legitimate purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">and that we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">always be where we run with hammers it</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">pick any tool in my house and i could</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">make a weapon out of it if you want it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">right and similarly pick any</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">intellectual tool and i can make a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">weapon out of it i can use</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">the principles of critical thinking as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.680" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">way to just be an asshole and tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">everyone that they&#39;re in logical fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">um so hegelian dialectic has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">weaponized to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">what is the conclusion i want the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">person to come to whether it&#39;s true or</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">not for my own game theoretic purposes</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll phrase that as a synthesis and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">i will reverse engineer a thesis and an</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">antithesis both of which will have</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">errors hidden but all use principles of</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">and i&#39;ll frame it up that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">truth here there&#39;s some truth here and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">the synthesis is obviously true</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">so that weapon has been used all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">time but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">tool is not actually valid so i it has</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">to do with what is the intent and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">capacity of the use of the intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">now the last part there is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">thesis and antithesis there might be</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">right there might be lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">insights around a thing going on and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">do we</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">where we have collective choice making</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">because whether we build a utility or a</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">that we engage in and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">whether we do that through a democratic</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">and that does involve coordinating how</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">and coordinating what we think is</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">and specifically two things uh that i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">like to summarize that stood out to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">is i think on the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">the first statement that every</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">has truth in some in some part</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">and the second that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">the partiality of it that it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:52.750" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">true um</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">as a part of a bigger picture or it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">this um the more we try to force</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">uh or or reduce this partiality and say</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">like okay no my truth is the only truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">or is the is the the the biggest part</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">and and reduce the dimensionality and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">say okay it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">a good transition to talk about sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">making right because</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">um once we&#39;ve established that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">hey every perspective has</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">truth right and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of a bigger picture now it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">make more sense of that because if all</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">perspectives are relevant</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">we need to understand all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">perspectives and we need to listen</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">and we need to find consensus to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">sure that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">proceed and progress and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">develop into a higher higher stage</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">of human consciousness as well or or</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">consensus</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">so what&#39;s your take on on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">um the status we are in right now as a</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">on a global level and and what do you</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">so there&#39;s some tools we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">construct together first</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about the</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">or the um believe completeness of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.839" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">view there&#39;s a very deep topic that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">comes up which is a</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">have the sense that their view is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have a very deep relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">the unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:29.839" style="s2">and with the extent of the category that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:29.839" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">unknown unknowns right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">so they don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">everything they know is can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">represented in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">finite number of bits and usually a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">relatively small finite number of bits</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:48.960" style="s2">and the totality of reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">via tarsky&#39;s theorem or girdle&#39;s theorem</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">or whatever is fundamentally infinite</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">and so they know no fraction right</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">mathematically represented fraction</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">and so um you know nothing basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">as a fraction of all that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">and so this leads to certainty bias and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">this is one of the things i became</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">rubios of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">early because as someone who is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">interested in learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">when i was pretty young i would learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">things and get excited and then i</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">i knew more about a topic than some</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">people around me and then i get over</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">certain that i understood the topic</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">and then i would learn more and i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:29.760" style="s2">like oh there&#39;s like whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">universes around this i didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">i was unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">right like when people start learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">math and the most advanced thing they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">ever heard about when they&#39;re a kid is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">calculus</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t know the whole universe or</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2"> beyond calculus that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">factoring so</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">by the time they&#39;re in eighth grade they</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">think they&#39;re getting pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">knowing all of math</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s the case in</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">most any field including understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">reality which includes new fields all</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:56.640" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">and so one of the things happened for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.640" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">was i</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">started getting really embarrassed</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">about the things that i had been sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">about that then i became completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">clear were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">and not wanting to do that thing a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">right and that started to temper</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">the relationship to premature certainty</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">and then i found it very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">study history</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">and look at how many things that humans</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">believed so fervently that they would</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">die in war</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">for the belief where they would kill</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">other humans for the belief that all</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">seem ludicrous to us now like pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">much all of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">and how easy it is for us to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">where previous people were wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">what they were certain of they had the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">genetically same brains as us</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">and how easy it is for us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">sense that someone else is completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">wrong about something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">they&#39;re very deeply certain of but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">nobody can actually think of a single</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">belief that they currently hold that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">they think they&#39;re wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re probably wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really disastrous human</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">because those wrong beliefs inform</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">and so if i&#39;m continuously navigating on</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">a map that&#39;s not true i&#39;ll be driving</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">into cliffs and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">right like it&#39;s important that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">calibrate my map</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">especially as i want to do more</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">significant action for most people it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter that much because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">scope of what they&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">allows their ignorance to not be hitting</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">them in the face all the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">now it&#39;s very easy to overcompensate in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">and to say okay anytime that anyone has</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">ever been certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">it was unwarranted and there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">no absolute truths therefore there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">even relative higher truth claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">everything is just perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">and anyone who claims that something has</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">more validity</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">is somewhere between immature and an</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">imperialist</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of the direction that a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">lot of the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">movement of thinking went right but this</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">is also gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">because we will be acting in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ll be acting on some information</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s not equally good information</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">and some things make rocket ships work</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">and some things don&#39;t make rocket ships</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">and we can be pretty empirically clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">about whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">a technology works based on our</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">understanding of it or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">and if if we have to treat a viral</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">condition or make decisions regarding</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">policy or whatever it actually really</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2"> matters that we are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">things right regarding this right and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">what we&#39;ve tried to develop things like</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">the scientific method and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">the various domains of science and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">types of epistemic tools for</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">but we also start to get quickly into</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">the place that the way we</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">think about science formally is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">a method that can be applied to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">domain of things that are both</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">measurable and repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">well there are things that are real that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">are not measurable like every experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever had</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">i can measure what&#39;s happening in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">brain in some very narrow dimension</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty hard to do an fmri and a qeg</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">and whatever on you at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">because they</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">are affecting each other and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">still only gives me a tiny bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">total</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">insight right but i can&#39;t measure your</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">i can&#39;t do a third person process on</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">first person</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s also lots of real stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">is measurable but not repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">like all novel phenomena and so then i</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">can try and do statistics and but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite science</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">right so we start to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">science is necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">to understand the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">so then the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">what are the right methods what are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">right epistemics to go about</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">coming up with the confidence margin</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">what confidence do i need to inform what</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">kind of action based on how</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">consequential the action is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">and based on how consequential</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">non-acting is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">and so this is now getting us into</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">sense making but i can&#39;t sense make well</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">if i have a bias towards wanting more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">certainty than i really have the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">foundation for or i have a bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">being uncomfortable with any certainty</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.919" style="s2">and wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">continue to dwell within uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.919" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">multi-perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">process without actually integrating</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">them and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">this is an interesting place where like</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">emotional biases and existential and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">identity biases end up affecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">and uh and yet perspective taking is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">connected to all of it which is why i</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">really like the name of the podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">why i thought it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">the topic is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">when i&#39;m doing repeatability in science</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a perspective process</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;m wanting to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">that this particular thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">holding as objective is true across all</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">of these perspectives that hold the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">right that it&#39;s not subjective or</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">intersubjective the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">obviously that doesn&#39;t science doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">give me how to do governance because</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">governance has a lot of first person and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">second person stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">right like mostly all of it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">informed by third person so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">there i have to do perspective seeking</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">of like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">it&#39;s so easy like in the us right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">especially politically it&#39;s so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">take a whole group of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">other side of the political spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">just throw them all out as bad and dumb</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">and both sides do it kind of equally</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">and without</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">even being able to empathize with why</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">they seem bad and dumb to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">or why the other side could actually see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">anything that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">now when you ask what are the source of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">the problems this is one of the source</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">and this creates radically inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">government this creates war</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">this creates poor coordination and poor</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">shared sense making this creates</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">super inefficiently utilized resource</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also why the divorce rate is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">high and why people have shitty</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">at the micro level when i used to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">relationship counseling with people</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">one of the things which is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">be a relationship counselor for a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">while in your life because</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">when you watch other people doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">so obvious and so dreadful and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">realize that you did that and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">you&#39;re ashamed to ever do that again and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">it helps</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">but typically this pattern that i would</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">see again and again was that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">the couple would sit down and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">her version of the story</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so clear how things would be better</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">if he did stuff differently</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">she&#39;s tried all the things that she can</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">and she can&#39;t make it better um which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">why she&#39;s frustrated she&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">because obviously he has to and in his</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">version of the story things would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">better if she did stuff differently</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">and this is why they&#39;re on their path to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">divorce</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">and all that can do because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">perspective taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">right so i started all that can do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">make them resent each other and feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">powerless</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">and then to the extent that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">powerless and the other person has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">trying to control the other person is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">the best thing they could possibly do</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">and uh and this is actually another</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">important point when you wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">back to the world is if if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">sense make even what the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">the people closest to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">is and can&#39;t resolve those conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">we&#39;re so not qualified to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">help israel and palestine or the us and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">china or</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s important to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s those personal experiences are a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">training ground to get very basic</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">capacities because the larger issues are</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">still just human issues</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">multiplied by a lot of scale um</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">and so one of the things i started doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">was to just speed it up because i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">tired of the process where</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">she would tell her side of the story and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">he&#39;d be shaking his head the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">she and he still wouldn&#39;t get it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">then he&#39;d tell his side of the story and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">she&#39;d be crying feeling so unseen and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">misunderstood and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">and so i just stopped them in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">beginning and be like look i know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">both know your own side of the story so</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t want you to tell it to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">i want you to tell the other person side</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">of the story from the beginning right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">husband tell me</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">why she&#39;s upset what she perceives what</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">she would like to be different</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">before you do i want you to tell me how</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">good you think you&#39;re going to do with</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">like how well do you think you probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">understand it and then i do the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">and what was interesting was they never</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">did a good job</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">if they did they wouldn&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">problems but they always thought they</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.799" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">would do a better job than they did</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">so not only did they do a bad job</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">of understanding each other but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t even realize how badly they</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand each other right</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">because it was an unknown unknown class</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">that they weren&#39;t even recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">but i think it all comes down to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">topic of certainty then um</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">where it&#39;s like how certain i am in what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">believe to be true and how open and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">at the other side how open am i to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">look at things that are outside of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">i believe to be true</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">with it certainty is an important part</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">which is why i brought it up</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">one can have certainty that what i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">has some</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">and this is why it&#39;s so important to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">recognize the unknown unknown class not</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:52.480" style="s2">just the that i know that i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">but the the most difficult part i</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">struggle with is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">okay what you mentioned before is</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">i i perceive humans to be mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">relative thinkers it&#39;s like okay i have</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">this thing that i compare myself or my</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">view or my</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">my idea to and so now okay i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">at the unknown i&#39;m looking at all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">potential things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">are could be there will be there um</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">and now as you said before it feels</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">infinite</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">and how do i compare my</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">limited or like yeah my limited</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">understanding to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">something that i that is infinitely hard</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">like this this part i i con constantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">struggle with him when you said like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">sense making a part of that is certainty</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">like how do i ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">can say it&#39;s like oh i&#39;m that and this</p>

<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">yeah so this is great because you just</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">like an intuitive resonance like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean every conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">theorist agrees with every</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">thing that any particular person says</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">so as i over generalize to just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">make a point and then we can add the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">nuance back you can see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strongly polarizing thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">where then there is basically no</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">perspective seeking across that divide</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">usually that happens</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">well if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">ask in abstract</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">so asking an abstract is helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">we&#39;ll remove all the emotional tension</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">of this situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">so conspiracies have have some people</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">shared information with some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">people to coordinate for some activity</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">share widely with everyone for their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">personal gain throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">is that a thing that happens yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">course that&#39;s a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">happens happens</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">all the time it&#39;s the it&#39;s all of what</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">you can call like political strategy</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">and so then do some people get very good</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">at intentionally lying and misinforming</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">you were a poker player right a bluff is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">done that before yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">we were intentionally mastering the art</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">of misinformation disinformation for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">game theoretic advantage right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">and soccer player does it when they fake</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">to go this way and then they actually go</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">this way or they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">in any game theoretic scenario truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">about reality equals adapt</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">equals competitive advantage so you want</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">to throw the other guy off</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">so if i&#39;m a politician or if i&#39;m running</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">a business and trying to corner the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">market or whatever it is i&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">create both withhold my true information</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">create some false information so i can</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">advance so depending on</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">depending on the goal of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">the defined goal right if your goal is</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">your personal events</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">then maybe yes but if your goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">society father like flourish then</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">theoretic scenario we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">about a coordination game right but a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">zero-sum type game yeah so then</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">truth becomes one of the weapons it</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">becomes one of the things that we fight</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">the battle with</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">um so withholding information trade</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">secrets patents classified information</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">and then disinforming</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">right propaganda whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">well you don&#39;t have to study history</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">very much to see that you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:47.119" style="s2">entire lens of the history of the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">through that lens and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.119" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">insightful lens and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">and sun tzu was talking thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">years ago about how to conspire</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">right and how to break conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">effectively and machiavelli was talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">the idea that that&#39;s not a thing is just</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">silly</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">that said lots of the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">theories that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">said such and such was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">by this date never happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">and so they&#39;re like objectively clearly</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">and so to kind of generally bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">or away from that as a whole class is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">silly</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:24.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t think of it as a class in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.839" end="00:43:31.760" style="s2">um so but let&#39;s just say that we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">and we or we&#39;re looking at the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">who do</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve never actually seen an information</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">ecology and news ecology</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">more up than i&#39;m seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">with regard to kobe because</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like it&#39;s not even just the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">popular news it&#39;s even science journals</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">the uk saying oh we&#39;re going to stay</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">open and do herd immunity and then like</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">a couple days later oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">actually everyone&#39;s gonna die because</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">the imperial college just said this</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">thing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually gonna lock down for 18</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">months and then oh no</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">we over-corrected and that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">um the the range</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">even of within the scientific literature</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">of ideas and guesses about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">is orders of magnitude of and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.839" style="s2">partly that&#39;s because it&#39;s a novel virus</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.839" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">partly it&#39;s because things like</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">epidemiology are actually complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">and this one where you have a long</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">contagious asymptomatic period is</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">particularly complex to try to forecast</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">like the unknown unknowns are quite high</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">so similarly any one who has a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">kind of sense in them of mistrust of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">and state type authorities and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">think that any state action that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">going to decrease their freedom is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">probably some</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">deep state conspiratorial cabal that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">uh remove everyone&#39;s freedoms and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">oppress them</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going to just automatically tend</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">react to certain news in their news feed</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">more than others</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">right this is where the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">bias thing comes in and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">since most people when they read</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">news they aren&#39;t reading science</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">journals they&#39;re reading news that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">discusses something</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">in science and they don&#39;t go check the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">science journal themselves they decide</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">at a feeling level this feels true they</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">don&#39;t even realize they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">right because they didn&#39;t go through and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">look at the science journal look at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.839" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">the journals on the topic find the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">experts who disagree find why they</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">disagree look at the methodology and see</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">is the conclusion epistemically grounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s like see i knew the thing wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">real or c i knew it was going to kill</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">where really it&#39;s just hitting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">predisposition that&#39;s resonant and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">they&#39;re going with that resonance</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">but it goes in both ways right so there</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">the other side that just generally tends</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">that there is this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">legitimate authority and legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">experts and that science is real and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">science has the answers and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">and that there are these things called</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">science deniers and they might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">anti-climate changes or anti-vaxxers or</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">whatever and they&#39;re all dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">they&#39;re all problems and we just need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">like trust the scientific authorities</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell us what to do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">that&#39;s also kind of like a like an</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">emotional disposition</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">more than it is a very well analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">right and they&#39;re both silly</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">they both have a little bit of truth too</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">and they&#39;re both silly right</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to see the truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:38.079" style="s2">you won&#39;t understand a lot of why the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">world thinks what it is and you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.079" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">able to be effective if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">why people think what they think um</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">and you&#39;ll also be getting it wrong if</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the partial truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">so if i</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">if i&#39;m to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of people for whom if</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">anything comes from a major</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">uh authoritative scientific institution</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">they assume it&#39;s part of the great</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">um and it&#39;s the standard model bias and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">uh whatever let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">silly right like there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">that comes out of major universities</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">that empirically works like we test it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">and it makes better computers like it</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2"> works there&#39;s no question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:23.839" style="s2">real thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">and um and then on the other side the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.839" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">idea that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">perfect beautiful thing called the peer</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">review in the halls of academia that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">just does the perfect epistemics and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no ego or bias or fight and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">finances that influence the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">what&#39;s being researched don&#39;t play a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">role at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">that&#39;s just silly right and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">much stuff now where we have seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">people that are actively falsifying and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2"> up their research or even where</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">but like somebody put something that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">gibberish on purpose into peer review</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">and it gets published in an article</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">in a place like nature and people peer</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">review stuff based on</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">uh the politics of who is going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">who they need to get on the good side of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">for their own career advancement</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">and then even things like okay well even</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">if something isn&#39;t wrong</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">the things that are getting funded are</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">the things that somebody wants to fund</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">because they see that there will be an</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">roi</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">on that and there might be other things</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">that would be more true and more</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">relevant that will never get funded</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">because there&#39;s no roi so then we say</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">the preponderance of data</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">shows such and such but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">preponderance of data all in this one</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">little area of the whole picture based</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">incentives so it&#39;s misinforming even if</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">it&#39;s all true</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">right so then we have to say like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">does the fact that science needs funded</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">and is done by people with egos</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">and with politics involved does that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2"> up the epistemics of it yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">course it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t completely it up so</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.559" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">for me i actually go</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">into the science article i look at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">methodology i look at if the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">makes sense i try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">look at all of the literature and try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">do kind of structured literature review</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">then i try to find</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">experts in the field who disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">see if i can find out why they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">take the perspectives and i can start to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:11.520" style="s2">right so are</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">are the people who say just trust the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.520" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">institutions are they right no</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">the who got this wrong from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">beginning again and again like they</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost a perfect record of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">getting things wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">and um and many of the main universities</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">that were doing epidemiological models</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">were like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">bad they&#39;re pretty bad and um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">so we should just trust the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">as just silly that&#39;s just not paying</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">on the other hand um</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">and you know we can see the who and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">gates foundation and places like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">doing randomized control trials on</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">antivirals</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">for use in the intensive case which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">once people are in hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">when in the entire field of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">antivirals almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">only work immediately after exposure not</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">once you already have a severe illness</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like that doesn&#39;t even why</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">would they</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">why would anyone even do that trial that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even make sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">i mean yes you might want to see if that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">if like by surprise it helps late stage</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">people because that&#39;d be cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">but also include early stage which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">where there&#39;s really only any chance</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">but if you do late stage and then say it</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and generalize it as if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">early stage</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re just really</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">being kind of dull and not paying</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">attention to the entire body of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">antiviral knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">well maybe or maybe you want to show</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:39.880" style="s2">trump was an idiot and do us do an</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">information warfare piece that attacks</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.880" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">or maybe because you&#39;re a democrat or</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">supporter or</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">just hate him or whatever it is or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:50.559" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">have a drug that you really like and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">generic drugs that nobody&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">make any money on it would be better to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">show her ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">now are people that up</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">yeah like that kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">warfare is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important to know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">that the information we&#39;re being exposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">has agendas attached to it and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">agendas are not always the ones they say</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">they are the agendas are usually complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">so um now then the other side that says</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">the entire thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">is nonsense this is basically a flu</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">nobody&#39;s really dying</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s also just gibberish and all you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">call some icu doctors in new york and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">ask about their experience or in italy</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">and you&#39;ll never say that again</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">which i i did</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">you know early on was talking to them</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">working with it um</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">and so how was that like how was that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">what did they say</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">they were describing seeing uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">disease progression that was unlike</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">anything that they had seen before the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">whole ground glass opacities in the lung</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">rate at which people would degrade and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">break down</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">the complete failure of ventilation to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">do what</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">they would normally think it to do with</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">pneumonias um</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">you know they were very boggled by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">pathology it wasn&#39;t it didn&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">anything that they could make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">it all and then they were also</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">completely devastated just</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">putting people on intubation and taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">them off dead all day</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:28.720" style="s2">um and having to go in without ppe</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">and without adequate ppe and having to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.720" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re it&#39;s a trip because if</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">the doctors or nurses who decide to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">mostly would quarantine themselves at a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">hotel and someone just staying in their</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">car whatever because they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:44.559" style="s2">go back by their family and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">kill their family but that also means</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">that they know that they might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">leaving their children parentless</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want to leave these</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">people dying so like it&#39;s intense</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s a massive disrespect to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">whole thing when you just say the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">thing was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">farce because you didn&#39;t even do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">research deep enough to try to figure it</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">that side though that says the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">thing is a farce because</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.160" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">uh of just some control agenda</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">are there control agendas yes of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:20.079" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">and the thing is not to vars and it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">being utilized opportunistically the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">whole don&#39;t ever let a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">good don&#39;t let a good crisis go to waste</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">if if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">playing the market when the market has</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">more volatility if i&#39;m one of the better</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">players that has more insight i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">to do a lot better than when the market</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have volatility</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">and so a few people have made a ton</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">of money in the last couple months when</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">almost everybody lost a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">the movement of trillions of dollars it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">basically concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">and so if i&#39;m a major financial player</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">in the hedge fund world or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">have intelligence briefings it tells me</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">this thing is jumped out of wuhan and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">it&#39;s going to the world up whenever</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">could i with all of my money and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">connections try</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">to talk to the cdc and the who and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">president whatever and get them to do a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">better job of handling this well i could</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">i probably could succeed at that but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">not going to because that&#39;s not my job</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">and i&#39;m not motivated to do that my</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">fiduciary responsibility to shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">anyways is to maximize profit i&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">and short this market completely sell</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">the stocks at the top and then buy</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">back up at the bottom for you know a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">fraction of what it was worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">a couple months ago and will be worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">again very soon</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">now in the same way that market</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">volatility creates the opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">more power grabs</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">it also creates the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">increased volatility in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">in the world creates an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">more political power grabs</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">and so before this happened china was</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">trying to advance the belt and road</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">initiative and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">russia was trying to get eastern europe</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">back into</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">deeper alliance with it and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">different forces in the us were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">focused on fighting each other for</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">uh the u.s power grab and so then when</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">this situation comes they just keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">doing the thing they were doing just</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">using the increased</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">volatility of trillions of dollars of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">stimulus money and who can get it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">and um and like that but that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.839" style="s2">also then ends up influencing media</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">narratives and even what science is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.839" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">getting funded and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">and so then we look at things like</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">contact tracing okay well we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">diagnostics so that we can stop the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">spread of the disease but then if</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.119" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">someone tests positive we want to know</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">everyone that they&#39;ve interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">so that we can go test them as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">you&#39;ll have you know a single person</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">who&#39;s asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">can reinfect the whole world so</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">empower some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">phone-based app to do contact tracing</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">should people be concerned about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">from a civil liberties</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">surveillance point of view absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">like that&#39;s a really terrible thing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">in that way and it&#39;s a really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">thing and these are both true</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">right like i think we need contact</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">tracing</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want high-tech surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">that will never be removed afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:17.119" style="s2">because if you look i mean i&#39;ll speak to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">the us here because i know it better</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.119" end="00:56:21.359" style="s2">when an emergency happens we will we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">usually put in a provisional emergency</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.359" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">act to deal a wartime type act</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">but we don&#39;t repeal it after the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">thing&#39;s over hardly ever because once</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">power players have got more power they</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to give it back</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have to and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">else it customizes and moves on and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">kardashians or whatever um and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">so the fisa act or the patriot actor the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">homeland security act of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.760" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">like those don&#39;t don&#39;t roll away okay so</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">after 9 11 and we realized they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">really have weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">do we roll those acts back</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:57.839" style="s2">no and so is that this type of situation</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">again but where we even start getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.839" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:03.680" style="s2">wanting to breach people&#39;s biomedical</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">security and be able to determine</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.680" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">whether they can travel or not based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.040" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">whether they</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">to have antibodies or vaccinated or i</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:15.599" style="s2">really dangerous and i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">do contact tracing</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.599" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">now i think we do low-tech contact</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.319" style="s2">tracing just like we did with epidemics</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">throughout all of history where you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.319" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">ask people who did you come in contact</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">with and i think there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">forms of contact tracing technologically</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">that are much safer</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">and i think there are ways to put forced</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">expiries in them</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">right but this is where it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re kind of left oriented</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">and you hear the guys who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:43.119" style="s2">this is just a big hoax</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">and they just want to surveil us they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.119" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">partly right</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">now what they&#39;re saying as is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">actually very dangerous and pernicious</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:52.559" style="s2">and problematic</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">but they&#39;re also kind of partly right</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.559" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">are there agendas that are seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">advance the asymmetric power they</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">already have in the situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:03.280" style="s2">and we should watch out for it yes of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.280" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">and typically when you see that power</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">follows a power law distribution right</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a few people who have most</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">of the power and then progressively less</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.440" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">the people who got here didn&#39;t get it by</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">sharing their power</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">like that&#39;s not that&#39;s not how that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">happened they got it by winning a game</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">theory again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:22.240" style="s2">again and getting good at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.240" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">so typically those who have more power</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">asymmetric power and a power law</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">use their asymmetric power to protect</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">and get more asymmetry of power</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">like that&#39;s the generator function and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting against other people</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">who are also trying to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:41.839" style="s2">you know is it going to be zuckerberg or</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">is it going to be xi ji ping who gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">the metcalf law</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">one ring to rule them all that creates</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">the digital currency that is the new</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">reserve currency for the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">um so then you can even have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">plausible deniability of saying well i</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">otherwise the other guy is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">now that still looks like those with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">most power using that radical asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">power to concentrate more power</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">does that tend to be in the good of</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">everyone no will we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.040" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">give one example where it seems to be in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:12.559" style="s2">the good of everyone as the source of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">selling point the sugar that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.559" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">medicine go down</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">sure so</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">this is when we talk about perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">seeking and the faulty confidence</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">i only see faulty confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">kind of mainstream narratives because</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.200" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">mostly they live at too</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.559" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">low a complexity level to</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">make adequate sense of reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">but i mean with increased understanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.240" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">automatically i feel your level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">confidence goes down</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:48.799" style="s2">because the moment you start reaching a</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">level of complexity of understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.799" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">many potential factors go into it</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">you understand how many factors you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t even have a proper clue about</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">yes now you start to become</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">so there was a mayor of a california</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:07.200" style="s2">city who</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">contacted me today and it was so</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.200" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">refreshing it was one of the few</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">politicians that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">elicit um upset emotions in me</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">um so she was lovely and she said like i</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">this topic i don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">questions to ask i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to waste your time but you</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">know like i want to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:34.640" style="s2">and i&#39;m like i&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">mayor</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.640" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">because someone who seems earnestly like</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">they really care</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">and really wants to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">and knows that they don&#39;t know and is</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.599" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">to find the right source of input</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">can be trusted with leadership</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">in the doubt itching again</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">you can almost read it you can read it</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">as a book of religion or</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">a book of leadership or a book of um</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">political philosophy and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">true but you can read as a book of</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">and it kind of has this gist that says</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">the person who wants to lead everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">should run away from</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of like those who</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">get asymmetric power because they</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:17.359" style="s2">pursued the out of it who use it to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">keep receiving the out of it right</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.359" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">um but those who really don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:22.960" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">and everyone pushes them to lead because</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.960" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">everyone trusts them so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">you can probably trust them right so</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">uh there is some relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">certainty and uncertainty thing in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s say for instance we look at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">epidemiology</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">when we open back up is it going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">spike again are we going to get hurt</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">immunity</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll give you just the tiniest example</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">some elements of the complexity that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">so the binary narrative of this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">basically airborne aids</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s just going to keep killing</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">everyone until we get a vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">or um</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:12.640" style="s2">or it was overblown hype and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">already over it and we should just</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.640" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">release the restrictions are both</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">just so silly and yet what is actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">true is pretty complex</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">so when you look at how hard an</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">area gets hit what are the factors well</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">how many cases arrived there originally</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">before it was known</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:36.160" style="s2">is going to be a factor what was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">viral load of those cases was it a light</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.160" end="01:02:38.400" style="s2">viral load or a serious viral load and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">what was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">were they super spreaders or not in</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:43.760" style="s2">terms of what type of interaction</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:45.839" style="s2">were they getting into what was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.760" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">population density and the population</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.839" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">dynamics what were the background</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">demographics in terms of age and mixing</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">across ages and comorbidities</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">was it an area that had high</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">environmental pollution of the types</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">that would already create lung</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">problems did they have previous</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">vaccinations because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">indication that those who got flu</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">vaccines last year got more</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:09.119" style="s2">serious covid and that some people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">got vaccinations of other types</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.119" end="01:03:12.799" style="s2">in the third world it might actually be</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">slightly protected against covid</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.799" end="01:03:17.599" style="s2">uh there&#39;s some indication that people</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">who got one of the coronaviruses last</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.599" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">actual the normal four strains of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">chronovirus</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.520" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">actually are getting coveted worse so</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">the antibodies are not only not</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">protective but priming a cytokine storm</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">so then we would have to ask did that</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">area have a previous bad coronavirus as</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">part of its flu season</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">what types of interventions did the area</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">put in place how early did it put those</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">interventions in place what are the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">cultural dynamics regarding hygiene and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">closeness</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">of contact and things like that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">would already be part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">you know mitigating the differences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:53.599" style="s2">a lot of variables and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">all of a lot of those variables are like</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.599" end="01:03:56.559" style="s2">a tiny change in an exponent makes a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">pretty big difference over a little</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.559" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">so a lot of those are exponent variables</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:05.359" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">near thresholds um now we didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">get into mutations yet</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">but could it be that some of the areas</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.760" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">that are hit much harder than others</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">actually correspond to more and less</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">virulent mutations</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">yes that that is not well enough known</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">yet but is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:21.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll know it soon right being tracked</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:24.640" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.440" end="01:04:27.200" style="s2">if you look at one area that seems</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.640" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">now then we also even say well but how</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">many people are actually infected well</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">what tests are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the part i want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.000" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">ask you about actually about the testing</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">yeah so if we&#39;re only testing sick</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">people and then trying to estimate of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">course we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:43.359" style="s2">we have no background idea and then if</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:44.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to test other places what</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.359" end="01:04:46.559" style="s2">are the other places that actually give</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.960" end="01:04:47.760" style="s2">us relevant background information</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.559" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">because if the people are coming out and</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">interacting</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">they might already be a higher risk</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:52.880" style="s2">population than the people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">coming out and interacting and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.880" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like how do you get</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2">appropriate sample that&#39;s one question</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">then what are the false negatives and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.000" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">false positives of the type of test</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">methodology that i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">if i&#39;m using amino assays</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">am i we have some evidence coming out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">china that about 30</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">of the people who have the disease were</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.119" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">really pretty sure they had the disease</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">like they had the symptomology and pcr</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">showed that they have the disease about</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">30</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">of them don&#39;t produce antibodies so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:29.359" style="s2">um that&#39;s not even about a false</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">negative false negative means when</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.359" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">they&#39;re producing antibodies the test</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:33.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pick it up</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.520" style="s2">this is that they just aren&#39;t even doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">it right we also know that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.520" end="01:05:39.359" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you you got chronovirus</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.359" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">you got sarge cove too today you</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:44.400" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be producing antibodies for</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:45.039" style="s2">some period of time we&#39;ll call it 10</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">days because</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.039" end="01:05:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s got to go through the mucosal</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:49.440" style="s2">system into the blood the blood&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.920" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">produce enough antibodies</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.440" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">test picks it up so we wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">call that a false negative yet because</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the antibodies in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.200" end="01:05:58.160" style="s2">blood and the test just isn&#39;t sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:05:59.440" style="s2">enough it&#39;s that it&#39;s too early in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.160" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">disease progression but you might be</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.440" end="01:06:03.920" style="s2">infectious that entire time</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">right then there&#39;s some question if some</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.920" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">of the original</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">tests that got released had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">false positives because</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">they actually reacted with antibodies</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">from the previous coronaviruses that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:16.559" style="s2">people have been exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:18.240" style="s2">and so some of the things about oh much</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.559" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">higher background rate and so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">already closer to saturation</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">then we have to say well does saturation</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">mean anything even because</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">is immunity being conferred we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">know if immunity is being conferred</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:32.079" style="s2">so all ideas on herd immunity are</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">premature at this point</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.079" end="01:06:37.200" style="s2">you can date whatever date this is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;re talking because</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.200" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">are there people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.039" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">got covid got better and then had it</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:49.680" style="s2">yes a lot like five to ten percent of</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">people in the hubei province</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:55.119" style="s2">and in in um south korea and japan</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:56.319" style="s2">now do we know that it&#39;s the same strain</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.119" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">as opposed to one strain than another</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.319" end="01:06:59.680" style="s2">chain we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.760" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">amino assays won&#39;t even tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.680" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">right most of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">the types of amino acids do we know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">they fully got rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.880" end="01:07:09.440" style="s2">and then they got it again exogenously</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">versus their viral load just went down</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">and then resurged</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">without ever having fully got rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:15.680" style="s2">we don&#39;t know the answer to those things</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.680" end="01:07:19.440" style="s2">now when people say oh well this will</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">can when you you have the antibodies so</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.440" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">of course you&#39;re immune</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:24.880" style="s2">no there are there are viruses that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:25.359" style="s2">you&#39;ll produce antibodies too that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:26.720" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.359" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">immunity and there are some viruses</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.720" end="01:07:29.760" style="s2">where the second time you get it is much</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:34.000" style="s2">worse like dengue fever</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.760" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">right um and obviously with</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:39.200" style="s2">ebola or hiv or hep c our answer wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">hurt immunity right our answer was</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.200" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2"> stop the suppression of it um</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">and so it tends to be that herd immunity</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">will be our answer for respiratory</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">things that are very hard to suppress</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">because they&#39;re respiratory</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">and that are part of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">background that we&#39;ve been exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.680" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:59.920" style="s2">if it&#39;s novel right meaning we we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">co-evolve with this thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:06.079" style="s2">then uh how long will it take to produce</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">effective antibodies</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.079" end="01:08:10.720" style="s2">is a very like unknown question and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">you could even get to where you have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">saturation of the population and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">then now you could also have a situation</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:21.440" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:23.839" style="s2">someone produces antibodies and</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.440" end="01:08:25.359" style="s2">you you can&#39;t think of everyone the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.839" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">like like we said about 30</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.359" end="01:08:28.400" style="s2">of the people who weren&#39;t producing</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:30.480" style="s2">meaningful number of antibodies</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.400" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">and so it might be that some people do</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.480" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">produce an antibody response that can</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">for some immunity and some don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:36.799" style="s2">and that you might have a gaussian</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">distribution or some other kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.799" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">distribution across the population</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:43.440" style="s2">you might also have that there was one</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">chinese study that showed that older</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.440" end="01:08:47.920" style="s2">people were producing about 5x 3 to 5x</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">more antibodies than younger people</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.920" end="01:08:51.279" style="s2">which would be opposite of what we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">want to see it could so that could</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.279" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">actually mean that it is priming an</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">immune response that is of the more</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:09:00.560" style="s2">cytokine storm type that makes it worse</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">um there are ways we could figure this</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">out but it hasn&#39;t happened yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">and now also as it&#39;s mutating are we</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">going to have a worse round to follow up</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">like happened with 1918</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">uh spanish flu</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">well we won&#39;t be able to know perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">but we can look at the nature of how</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s mutating so far</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">which regions have good error correction</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:24.239" style="s2">in them etc and start to make some good</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">forecasts</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.239" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">but i would say there&#39;s still massive</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:29.679" style="s2">unknowns in there</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">then what happens when co when sars cove</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.679" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">2 and influenza hit at the same time in</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">this next flu season</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t know and so all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">so the right answer is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:46.560" style="s2">this is a pretty complex multi-factorial</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:48.480" style="s2">thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">and whether people get immunity or not</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.480" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">and whether the immunity</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:54.960" style="s2">lasts for two years or only two months</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">and whether the immunity will be</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">effective against</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:00.320" style="s2">meaningful mutations or not and whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s mutating or not</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.320" end="01:10:04.800" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s the same for the whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">population or only for parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.800" end="01:10:08.239" style="s2">population and whether it primes a worse</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:10.320" style="s2">secondary response and</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.239" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">um and if we came up with a vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.320" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">because we saw that the influenza</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:15.120" style="s2">vaccine that people did last year it</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:16.800" style="s2">looks like produced about a 25 percent</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.120" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">more severe response than people who got</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.800" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">covered because it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.280" style="s2">shunting the immune in function in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:23.600" style="s2">particular direction</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.280" end="01:10:25.280" style="s2">might we actually make a vaccine for</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.600" end="01:10:26.800" style="s2">this that doesn&#39;t protect against a</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.280" end="01:10:28.320" style="s2">mutation actually primes them to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.800" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">worse that are already more lethal ones</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.320" end="01:10:30.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2"> unknowns</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.719" end="01:10:36.719" style="s2">so you want to do is list them all right</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">and then say what kind of research do we</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">need to do to figure these things out</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:41.679" style="s2">and how do we coordinate the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:43.120" style="s2">international research efforts and how</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.679" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">do we make sure the methodology is</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.120" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:49.280" style="s2">and how do we coordinate a global exit</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.280" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">because there really are no national</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">exit strategies right</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">if herd immunity is a thing maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a national exit strategy</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">but otherwise we</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:04.320" style="s2">the no country gets to return to normal</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t get an open trade and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.320" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">travel back up</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:10.000" style="s2">and given that only one person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">asymptomatic has to have it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.000" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">re-trigger the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">this is a uniquely interconnecting for</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">the whole world situation</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">right and we know that what works in</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">vienna isn&#39;t going to be the solution</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:24.640" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">india and bangladesh just because of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.640" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">cost per capita and yet</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">a solution that doesn&#39;t work for india</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">in bangladesh keeps vienna unsafe</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">or unable to open it&#39;s like okay so we</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:37.040" style="s2">need a global exit strategy</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">and we can think about that like what</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.040" end="01:11:39.920" style="s2">are the various types of exit herd</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.400" end="01:11:41.280" style="s2">immunity would be one well we got to</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.920" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">answer the questions to see is that even</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.280" end="01:11:44.719" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.320" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">right and if it&#39;s not a thing right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.719" end="01:11:47.280" style="s2">can we make it a thing can we make it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:48.719" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.280" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">are there things that we can do to help</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">prime people&#39;s immune system</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">to have better immune responses right</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">what about vaccination similarly we</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t succeeded at vaccines for the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">four coronaviruses that have been around</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:03.199" style="s2">forever there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">viruses that took us a very long time to</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.199" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">find effective vaccines and things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:10.400" style="s2">the flu that mutate a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">don&#39;t work for uh the ongoing mutation</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.400" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">so does that mean that this is a new</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:13.679" style="s2">thing that we just have forever and have</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.679" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">take new you know vaccines for forever</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:20.159" style="s2">so with the unknowns there then we say</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:22.320" style="s2">well maybe we&#39;ll just the end</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.159" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">the end state is suppression we just</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.320" end="01:12:26.719" style="s2">have to diagnose</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">everyone and contact trace to just fully</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.719" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">suppress it</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">ebola it&#39;s really hard with something</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.840" style="s2">that is asymptomatic for possibly</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">weeks or months or forever and some</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.840" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:40.480" style="s2">yet they&#39;re infectious like that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">of uniquely terrible</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.480" end="01:12:46.000" style="s2">as far as contagion goes and how are you</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.920" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">gonna really contact trace and diagnose</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.000" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">everyone in bangladesh um like</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.199" end="01:12:52.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty serious technological</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:56.719" style="s2">rollout you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.640" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">per capita dollar wise so</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.719" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">then we start saying well we can some</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">amount of that has to happen right</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:05.199" style="s2">there&#39;s we definitely want to suppress</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:06.800" style="s2">where we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.199" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">but also the herd immunity answer</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:11.120" style="s2">affects that right</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">now animals are getting it and we live</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">with the animals if the animals can</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">store it do we ever get to full</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:16.480" style="s2">suppression if it&#39;s zoonotic and can</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.480" end="01:13:19.760" style="s2">passing back now and and our cats and</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:22.320" style="s2">dogs and are getting it</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.760" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.320" end="01:13:25.199" style="s2">variables right</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">so then we get into the management well</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.199" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">how do we treat it can we make it to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:30.159" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:32.159" style="s2">it really is only as bad as the flu the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.159" end="01:13:33.679" style="s2">early stage antiviral makes it not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.159" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.679" end="01:13:38.080" style="s2">well the exit strategy those are like</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">clusters of exit strategies and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.080" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">they some are better than others but</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:42.080" style="s2">only if they&#39;re true and in order to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:44.560" style="s2">true there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.080" end="01:13:45.360" style="s2"> we have to figure out so what we</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.560" end="01:13:47.679" style="s2">need is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.360" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">coordinated approach for the entire</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.679" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">world to come up with an exit strategy</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">great as easy as that well</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:57.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a couple more parts we have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">make sure that our exit strategy will</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.360" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">also be good for follow-up mutation</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">rounds that could occur</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:03.280" style="s2">and follow up pandemics because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:05.199" style="s2">a situation where that</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.280" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">could be a thing again in time right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.199" end="01:14:08.400" style="s2">they could be more lethal this</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:10.960" style="s2">we were lucky that this one wasn&#39;t more</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:14.159" style="s2">lethal than it was so we have to also be</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.960" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">creating ongoing pandemic infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.159" end="01:14:17.920" style="s2">we also have to make sure that we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:19.360" style="s2">making the world worse by the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.920" end="01:14:22.400" style="s2">our solution</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.360" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t create radically</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.400" end="01:14:26.159" style="s2">up autocracies and surveillance states</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">and increase surveillance capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.159" end="01:14:32.239" style="s2">and decrease people&#39;s uh health privacy</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">or do rushed vaccines where we didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.239" end="01:14:34.719" style="s2">long-term safety studies that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:38.560" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.719" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">so we all we have to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.560" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">set up infrastructure for the next</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:44.960" style="s2">rounds of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">make sure we don&#39;t make worse</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.960" end="01:14:51.040" style="s2">at minimum and then hopefully also</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">set up more competent responses for</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.040" end="01:14:54.800" style="s2">other types of catastrophes</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">which are also impending and deal with</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:14:58.960" style="s2">have already started from this right we</p>

<p begin="01:14:58.960" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">a breakdown in the food supply because</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:05.440" style="s2">of this right so</p>

<p begin="01:16:03.679" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">right and then within that taking a</p>

<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:34.800" style="s2">to actually be able to sense make it</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:36.320" style="s2">well enough to come up with solutions</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.800" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">all of those are perspectives that have</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.320" end="01:16:39.840" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">well understood do you have the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.840" end="01:16:43.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">current governments do that or to what</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">do you think they do that</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">well so governments have government</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.440" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">agencies that are designed to look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:55.520" style="s2">different things right they have</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">agencies that look at logistics and</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.520" end="01:16:58.480" style="s2">supply chains and look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">national security threats of different</p>

<p begin="01:17:00.000" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">look at uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2">regulation of news and various things so</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:11.600" style="s2">the question is how well</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:12.080" style="s2">do they do it and to call governments a</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.600" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.080" end="01:17:15.040" style="s2">and unify across them would be silly</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:16.239" style="s2">because it&#39;s a pretty radical</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.040" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">distribution between</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.239" end="01:17:21.440" style="s2">how well some do it and others as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">function of lots of things</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.440" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">partly as a function of</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.840" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">how small the country is and how</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.960" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">homogeneous the population and the kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">of gdp per capita of it and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:37.199" style="s2">historical things and how established</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:39.600" style="s2">the culture is</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.199" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">uh all of those things all augment the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.600" end="01:17:41.840" style="s2">nature of the government and what kinds</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.840" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">wars and overhauls and did it go</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:47.360" style="s2">through it so we could</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">do that by a country by country basis</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.360" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.719" end="01:17:55.760" style="s2">the big countries</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:58.560" style="s2">like china does a very good job of</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.560" end="01:18:02.159" style="s2">but i can&#39;t say they do a good job of</p>

<p begin="01:18:02.159" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">for the interest of the world they do a</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.080" end="01:18:14.400" style="s2">this and i won&#39;t say china does a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.000" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">job i&#39;ll say the ccp</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.400" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">does a very good job of coordinating</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:19.280" style="s2">lots of functions in a top-down way</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:20.719" style="s2">probably the best job in the world right</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.280" end="01:18:22.239" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.719" end="01:18:27.760" style="s2">and they do it in a way that is good for</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">the ccp and its vision of china</p>

<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">the institutional deplay</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t it would naturally have</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">the capacity to do a good job with</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:41.360" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:43.679" style="s2">i i was um the first part was more</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">okay some things i&#39;d like to see the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:03.600" style="s2">i would like to see the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.840" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">working with all of its international</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.600" end="01:21:11.199" style="s2">allies to lead a global exit strategy</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">and that identifies the various</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.199" end="01:21:17.840" style="s2">types of exits that might be</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:19.440" style="s2">and coordinates the world&#39;s scientific</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.840" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">research happening at all the different</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.440" end="01:21:24.880" style="s2">institutions towards making sure that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">they&#39;re not duplicating similar research</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.880" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">they&#39;re not withholding the research or</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:31.120" style="s2">not having it synthesized in a central</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:33.120" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.120" end="01:21:34.480" style="s2">there aren&#39;t critical topics that are</p>

<p begin="01:21:34.480" end="01:21:38.159" style="s2">under addressed and white space being</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.239" end="01:21:41.199" style="s2">left so i would have a</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.159" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">international coalition effort towards</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.199" end="01:21:47.040" style="s2">global exit strategy</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:48.239" style="s2">it would identify what the types of</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.040" end="01:21:50.080" style="s2">exits could be</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.239" end="01:21:51.440" style="s2">and what needs to be known to figure</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.080" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">those out</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.440" end="01:21:55.440" style="s2">and then be coordinating the research</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:58.880" style="s2">towards that that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:22:00.639" style="s2">in the meantime that alliance effort</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:04.000" style="s2">would also</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.639" end="01:22:04.000" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.239" end="01:22:08.000" style="s2">all of the groups all the countries that</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.159" end="01:22:09.040" style="s2">want to ally which is not just european</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:11.199" style="s2">allies but</p>

<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:18.960" style="s2">did a better job of this than we did and</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.880" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">went through sars cove one and other</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.960" end="01:22:23.600" style="s2">things and like they just have this</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">more figured out than we do and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.600" end="01:22:26.719" style="s2">most of the countries i just mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:27.440" style="s2">are wealthy countries and like high-tech</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.719" end="01:22:29.679" style="s2">countries like</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.440" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">so to not include japan and south korea</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.679" end="01:22:34.000" style="s2">and singapore and an alliance effort</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">would just be silly especially given</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.000" end="01:22:38.480" style="s2">uh their relationship with china and</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:41.920" style="s2">ours and the tensions and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.480" end="01:22:46.159" style="s2">and an alliance effort to get</p>

<p begin="01:22:53.840" end="01:22:56.880" style="s2">many of the poorer countries because</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.280" end="01:22:59.520" style="s2">there is no solution that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.880" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">solution for everybody on this thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.520" end="01:23:05.360" style="s2">and if china is the major exporter of</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">solutions that&#39;s going to result in a</p>

<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:22.320" style="s2">but the current government</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:22.320" style="s2">that uses um</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.199" end="01:23:27.520" style="s2">radically technologically advanced</p>

<p begin="01:23:31.600" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">right we want to suppress that wherever</p>

<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:38.320" style="s2">in the u.s in china and wherever which</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.199" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">is also why i&#39;m saying this needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.320" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">an alliance effort so that nobody gets</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:44.480" style="s2">to do the power grab</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:45.600" style="s2">but the us is in the best position to</p>

<p begin="01:24:19.840" end="01:24:24.400" style="s2">discussion of how to do that but it so</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.159" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">obviously needs done</p>

<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:51.040" style="s2">roll out</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:52.960" style="s2">very high tech pcr diagnostics pretty</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.040" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">ubiquitously</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:58.560" style="s2">so that um we can see it very early</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.000" end="01:25:01.040" style="s2">stage with very high sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.560" end="01:25:02.639" style="s2">and be able to both isolate and start</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.040" end="01:25:04.080" style="s2">treating right away so the economy can</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.639" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">open back up without spreading the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.080" end="01:25:08.880" style="s2">pandemic vector again</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:10.400" style="s2">uh it should be investing very heavily</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.880" end="01:25:12.320" style="s2">in early stage treatment</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.400" end="01:25:14.880" style="s2">so that when people do get it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.320" end="01:25:18.080" style="s2">have to wind up in the icu</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.880" end="01:25:20.080" style="s2">with serious illness um</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:23.120" style="s2">so a lot of early stage treatment</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.080" end="01:25:26.719" style="s2">research they should prioritize</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.120" end="01:25:28.800" style="s2">existing drugs not new drugs</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.719" end="01:25:30.080" style="s2">um so hydroxychloroquine was actually a</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.800" end="01:25:32.719" style="s2">right thing to look at</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.080" end="01:25:34.639" style="s2">and ivermectin and methylene blue and</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.719" end="01:25:34.960" style="s2">pde inhibitors and a bunch of the ones</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.639" end="01:25:38.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.960" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">have been around for a long time a new</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.239" end="01:25:42.480" style="s2">drug</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:45.040" style="s2">we have no long-term safety data on so</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.480" end="01:25:47.520" style="s2">it might not kill you or do some like</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.040" end="01:25:49.440" style="s2">this is one of the interesting things is</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.520" end="01:25:51.040" style="s2">we will look for some signs of safety</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.440" end="01:25:52.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at liver enzymes and a few</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.040" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">things but we don&#39;t know what stuff to</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.400" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">look for</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">right there&#39;s a lot of biometrics you</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:25:59.760" style="s2">could track in a body</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:02.480" style="s2">so under a pandemic you might be tempted</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.760" end="01:26:04.719" style="s2">to rush the normal process</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.480" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">but rushing the normal process on a new</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.719" end="01:26:08.239" style="s2">thing where we have no long-term safety</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:10.560" style="s2">data is very different than</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.239" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">drugs that have been around for 20 or 50</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.560" end="01:26:14.480" style="s2">or 70 years we have a ton of safety</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:18.000" style="s2">data and all we&#39;re trying to find is new</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.480" end="01:26:18.880" style="s2">application right i&#39;m totally happier to</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.000" end="01:26:20.840" style="s2">rush</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.880" end="01:26:23.199" style="s2">a new application of a known safety</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.840" end="01:26:25.120" style="s2">profile</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.199" end="01:26:26.800" style="s2">i want to rush new drugs less and i want</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.120" end="01:26:29.360" style="s2">to rush vaccines even less</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.800" end="01:26:31.040" style="s2">because unlike small molecule drugs</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.360" end="01:26:32.719" style="s2">vaccines are intended to have permanent</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.040" end="01:26:34.080" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.719" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">and so i really want to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.080" end="01:26:36.800" style="s2">they&#39;re the right permanent effects</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.280" end="01:26:38.080" style="s2">right if they&#39;re intending to modulate</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.800" end="01:26:41.120" style="s2">the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.080" end="01:26:42.800" style="s2">lastingly then of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.120" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">all the drugs that you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.800" end="01:26:47.280" style="s2">long-term safety studies on vaccines the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.719" end="01:26:47.280" style="s2">most important</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.840" end="01:26:51.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.800" end="01:26:58.159" style="s2">so yes ubiquitous diagnostics contact</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.520" end="01:27:02.080" style="s2">tracing i would like to see them doing</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.159" end="01:27:03.920" style="s2">uh employing a hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.080" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">which people need employed anyways to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.920" end="01:27:07.840" style="s2">contact tracing</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:09.199" style="s2">um that don&#39;t require everyone</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.840" end="01:27:10.719" style="s2">activating their bluetooth</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.199" end="01:27:12.719" style="s2">or the things like that that open up</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.719" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">hacking and intelligence community</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.719" end="01:27:16.960" style="s2">issues and surveillance of different</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">types i would</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.960" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.719" end="01:27:30.320" style="s2">i would like to see the</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:37.520" style="s2">distribution of medical supplies and ppe</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:39.120" style="s2">and resources like that happen at a</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.520" end="01:27:42.320" style="s2">federal level</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.120" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">um they don&#39;t have to override state</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:45.840" style="s2">sovereignty and control the states to</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">support the states with supply chain</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.840" end="01:27:48.960" style="s2">capacities that our federal government</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:52.080" style="s2">has historically done</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.960" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">i&#39;d like to see that and um</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.080" end="01:27:56.239" style="s2">obviously the economic stimulus needs</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:27:59.440" style="s2">handled quite differently</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.239" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">um i i actually actually want to lead</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.440" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">over to</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:07.280" style="s2">um second and third</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:08.639" style="s2">uh order effects of kovid and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:12.639" style="s2">responses</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.639" end="01:28:15.199" style="s2">because i really really appreciate your</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.639" end="01:28:17.600" style="s2">insights into the interconnectedness of</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.199" end="01:28:21.040" style="s2">different topics and how things</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.600" end="01:28:21.600" style="s2">uh yeah how things on a global scale as</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.040" end="01:28:23.920" style="s2">well are</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.600" end="01:28:25.840" style="s2">are connected but also through sectors</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.920" end="01:28:27.280" style="s2">so how do you perceive</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.840" end="01:28:29.920" style="s2">or what do you perceive as the most</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.280" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">relevant uh second and third tier</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.920" end="01:28:34.960" style="s2">or other effects of of kovi</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">now that you&#39;ve mentioned financial i</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.960" end="01:28:37.679" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably going to be one of</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:40.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.679" end="01:28:44.239" style="s2">um the areas that are going to be really</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.800" end="01:28:44.239" style="s2">if really affected by it</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:48.400" style="s2">well there&#39;s super obvious ones and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.880" end="01:28:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s ones that are a little bit less</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.400" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">obvious and then there&#39;s ones that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.840" end="01:28:54.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.360" end="01:28:54.960" style="s2">is going to happen so</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.520" end="01:28:58.960" style="s2">one pretty obvious pretty bad one we</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.239" end="01:29:03.440" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.960" end="01:29:03.440" style="s2">was uh the food supply</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.679" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">um when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.719" end="01:29:10.880" style="s2">try to stop travel to stop a virus you</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:13.520" style="s2">can also break</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.880" end="01:29:15.600" style="s2">supply chains and in this case you break</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.520" end="01:29:17.600" style="s2">the supply chain of pesticides for areas</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.600" end="01:29:19.040" style="s2">that do monocrop agriculture and depend</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.600" end="01:29:20.639" style="s2">upon those and that&#39;s the only way they</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.040" end="01:29:23.120" style="s2">can control the locusts</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.639" end="01:29:24.560" style="s2">and you end up getting these massive</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.120" end="01:29:26.080" style="s2">numbers of locusts throughout northern</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.560" end="01:29:27.840" style="s2">africa and parts of the middle east that</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.080" end="01:29:31.120" style="s2">destroy all the crops and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.840" end="01:29:32.719" style="s2">under quarantine not letting uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.120" end="01:29:34.639" style="s2">farmers and distributors and would ever</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.719" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">be able to work so food is rotting in</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.639" end="01:29:39.920" style="s2">the fields and</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:41.520" style="s2">um and similarly so many of the major</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.920" end="01:29:45.679" style="s2">agricultural producers</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.520" end="01:29:49.040" style="s2">of uh potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.679" end="01:29:50.800" style="s2">uh chicken pork eggs whatever</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.040" end="01:29:52.159" style="s2">are used to selling to a small number of</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.800" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">vendors they sell to mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.159" end="01:29:55.040" style="s2">and the mcdonald&#39;s says the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">throughout its network and people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.040" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">going to mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">the people still need the food they just</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:01.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting at mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:03.920" style="s2">mcdonald&#39;s isn&#39;t doing it</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.440" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">and the and the farms aren&#39;t or the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.920" end="01:30:06.320" style="s2">agricultural manufacturers i won&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:07.840" style="s2">them farms</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.320" end="01:30:09.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t set up to get it directly to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.840" end="01:30:11.920" style="s2">people so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.600" end="01:30:13.440" style="s2">like in the u.s they&#39;re culling millions</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.920" end="01:30:14.159" style="s2">of animals just killing the animals and</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.440" end="01:30:17.120" style="s2">throwing</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.159" end="01:30:18.239" style="s2">throwing them out burying potatoes and</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.120" end="01:30:20.639" style="s2">food and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.239" end="01:30:22.960" style="s2">while there are millions of people with</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.639" end="01:30:24.639" style="s2">no access to food</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.960" end="01:30:26.320" style="s2">you know you you&#39;ve got hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.639" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">millions of people who have very bad</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.320" end="01:30:28.560" style="s2">food security in</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:30.159" style="s2">india right now a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.560" end="01:30:31.679" style="s2">starving in sub-saharan africa you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.159" end="01:30:33.040" style="s2">people in refugee camps who can&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.679" end="01:30:34.880" style="s2">who don&#39;t have food</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:36.639" style="s2">but even in the us and el paso you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.880" end="01:30:41.040" style="s2">these miles long</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.639" end="01:30:42.719" style="s2">lines of cars waiting for food and so</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.040" end="01:30:45.360" style="s2">can violence happen because of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.719" end="01:30:47.920" style="s2">pretty quickly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.360" end="01:30:50.000" style="s2">that could kill a lot more people than</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.920" end="01:30:52.320" style="s2">kovit ever would have killed</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:53.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very serious issue now</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.320" end="01:30:57.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a second order effect</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.920" end="01:30:59.280" style="s2">right can the violence lead to war</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.120" end="01:31:00.960" style="s2">can the war escalate as larger third</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.280" end="01:31:04.239" style="s2">order effects yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.960" end="01:31:06.639" style="s2">and you know when you start to look at</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.239" end="01:31:10.639" style="s2">existing political tensions and where</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.639" end="01:31:10.639" style="s2">high technological military power is</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.800" end="01:31:14.840" style="s2">you know one of the ones i&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.840" end="01:31:18.320" style="s2">concerned about is india</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.840" end="01:31:20.239" style="s2">because if</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.320" end="01:31:24.000" style="s2">millions or tens or hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.239" end="01:31:24.000" style="s2">of people stop having access to food</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.679" end="01:31:30.719" style="s2">do they just die peacefully or do they</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.400" end="01:31:32.560" style="s2">start to go into resource wars</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.719" end="01:31:34.400" style="s2">if they go into resource wars how does</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.560" end="01:31:37.360" style="s2">it cleave well probably along</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.400" end="01:31:38.800" style="s2">existing tension lines might that look</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.360" end="01:31:40.880" style="s2">like muslim hindu lines</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.800" end="01:31:43.040" style="s2">especially in northern parts of india</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.880" end="01:31:44.800" style="s2">could that lead to an india-pakistan war</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.040" end="01:31:47.199" style="s2">right like these are nuclear-equipped</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.800" end="01:31:48.400" style="s2">countries so that&#39;s one example but</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.199" end="01:31:51.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.400" end="01:31:51.360" style="s2">types of examples</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.719" end="01:31:56.800" style="s2">we also have breakdown in the supply</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.719" end="01:32:01.040" style="s2">chains of medical equipment</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.800" end="01:32:03.600" style="s2">and medicines that&#39;s a pretty huge deal</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.040" end="01:32:03.600" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.320" end="01:32:12.800" style="s2">the i the true idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.360" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">that dollars are dirty right that cash</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.800" end="01:32:15.840" style="s2">is actually a vector for disease</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:17.280" style="s2">transmission of a disease that lives on</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.840" end="01:32:19.920" style="s2">surfaces</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.280" end="01:32:20.880" style="s2">and to increase the impetus that was</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.920" end="01:32:22.639" style="s2">already there by</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.880" end="01:32:24.639" style="s2">a number of actors towards a digital</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.639" end="01:32:28.400" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.639" end="01:32:30.159" style="s2">a digital currency is a massive</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.400" end="01:32:32.400" style="s2">power play</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.159" end="01:32:34.159" style="s2">because let&#39;s say we look at the digital</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.400" end="01:32:36.639" style="s2">currency that china&#39;s been working to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.159" end="01:32:36.639" style="s2">roll out</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.639" end="01:32:42.560" style="s2">as much as you would think that there</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.560" end="01:32:44.400" style="s2">are issues with something like wechat or</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.560" end="01:32:47.600" style="s2">whatever that is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.400" end="01:32:49.840" style="s2">a very state engaged company</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.600" end="01:32:51.040" style="s2">it still has some degree of autonomy as</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.840" end="01:32:53.679" style="s2">a company</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.040" end="01:32:54.320" style="s2">but this is basically a digital currency</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.679" end="01:32:57.199" style="s2">issued by</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.320" end="01:32:59.120" style="s2">the chinese communist party directly</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.199" end="01:33:01.600" style="s2">which means that</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.120" end="01:33:02.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s anonymity in cash right</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.600" end="01:33:04.880" style="s2">nobody</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.480" end="01:33:06.480" style="s2">actually knows where i spend my cash</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.880" end="01:33:08.159" style="s2">with a digital currency it is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.480" end="01:33:10.159" style="s2">perfected financial surveillance</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.159" end="01:33:11.840" style="s2">apparatus to know exactly how much money</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.159" end="01:33:12.560" style="s2">i have where it is which accounts i move</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.840" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">it to when</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.560" end="01:33:17.840" style="s2">everything else right so of course</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:19.120" style="s2">governments want that right like a lot</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.840" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">of governments would want that to make</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.120" end="01:33:21.600" style="s2">sure tax evasion isn&#39;t happening and</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:22.960" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.600" end="01:33:24.400" style="s2">and if you really trusted your</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.960" end="01:33:25.679" style="s2">government to be totally awesome you</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.400" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">might be okay with that but</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.679" end="01:33:28.800" style="s2">this whole power corrupts absolute power</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:29.520" style="s2">corrupts absolutely thing keeps</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.800" end="01:33:32.960" style="s2">stuff up</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.520" end="01:33:35.840" style="s2">and um so</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.960" end="01:33:37.040" style="s2">then there is a we know that people</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.840" end="01:33:38.719" style="s2">don&#39;t want a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.040" end="01:33:41.040" style="s2">currencies</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.719" end="01:33:42.800" style="s2">and what is the world reserve currency</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.040" end="01:33:45.920" style="s2">so then we also start looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.800" end="01:33:47.840" style="s2">the oil price shocks right</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.920" end="01:33:50.320" style="s2">and seeing oil get down to a negative</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.840" end="01:33:52.400" style="s2">price is this unprecedented thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.320" end="01:33:54.239" style="s2">but besides the fact that that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.400" end="01:33:55.760" style="s2">deal and what does it mean and</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.239" end="01:33:57.920" style="s2">goes negative when there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.760" end="01:34:00.880" style="s2">storage to store the existing</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.920" end="01:34:02.560" style="s2">oil so then is that going to lead to</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.880" end="01:34:03.600" style="s2">somebody realizing that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.560" end="01:34:05.199" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.600" end="01:34:07.280" style="s2">create a lot more oil storage as a</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.199" end="01:34:08.960" style="s2">financial opportunity yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.280" end="01:34:10.560" style="s2">does that mean that with the price</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.960" end="01:34:11.120" style="s2">dropping in more oil storage we might</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.560" end="01:34:12.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.120" end="01:34:13.920" style="s2">have climate change going the worst</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.400" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">direction because they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.920" end="01:34:16.480" style="s2">have cheap oil open up whole new oil</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:18.719" style="s2">markets</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.480" end="01:34:20.400" style="s2">and demands start to increase in other</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.719" end="01:34:22.400" style="s2">ways yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.400" end="01:34:24.000" style="s2">um what does it mean in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.400" end="01:34:26.560" style="s2">militarism well</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.000" end="01:34:29.360" style="s2">we know that when the price of oil drops</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.560" end="01:34:29.360" style="s2">to almost nothing</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.159" end="01:34:35.199" style="s2">only the companies with the most money</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.520" end="01:34:38.320" style="s2">on hand can survive</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.199" end="01:34:39.679" style="s2">for very long right so saudi arabia will</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.320" end="01:34:41.360" style="s2">do fine for a while</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.679" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">and russia will do fine for a while as</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.360" end="01:34:45.280" style="s2">basically major wealthy state-sponsored</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:47.119" style="s2">oil producers</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.280" end="01:34:49.520" style="s2">but a lot of smaller states and private</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.119" end="01:34:51.840" style="s2">companies will start collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.520" end="01:34:53.920" style="s2">and so then is that just a radical</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.840" end="01:34:56.880" style="s2">concentration of power again</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.920" end="01:34:58.639" style="s2">yeah probably and then what type of</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.880" end="01:34:59.920" style="s2">geopolitical tensions does that create</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.639" end="01:35:00.639" style="s2">because let&#39;s say that some smaller</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.920" end="01:35:02.639" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.639" end="01:35:04.400" style="s2">loses their economic capability they</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.639" end="01:35:06.080" style="s2">can&#39;t take care of their people but they</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.400" end="01:35:07.840" style="s2">still have a military</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.080" end="01:35:09.280" style="s2">well it&#39;s a bad position to have your</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.840" end="01:35:10.080" style="s2">economics go to and still have a</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.280" end="01:35:11.520" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.080" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">because then you have to deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.520" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">somehow right um</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.280" end="01:35:21.440" style="s2">so these types of geopolitical things</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.080" end="01:35:22.320" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.440" end="01:35:25.760" style="s2">lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.320" end="01:35:29.360" style="s2">and you can see that then increasing</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.760" end="01:35:30.960" style="s2">of the price of oil we start looking at</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.360" end="01:35:32.400" style="s2">and that was that was related to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.960" end="01:35:33.520" style="s2">situation there was already systemic</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.400" end="01:35:36.320" style="s2">fragility but that was because of a</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.520" end="01:35:39.760" style="s2">decrease in demand for oil and then the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.320" end="01:35:41.679" style="s2">war over increasing the supply whatever</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:43.920" style="s2">now we could look at that moving in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.679" end="01:35:45.760" style="s2">direction of affecting climate change or</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.920" end="01:35:48.080" style="s2">in the direction of affecting</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.760" end="01:35:50.159" style="s2">geopolitical tensions towards war or</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.080" end="01:35:53.520" style="s2">financial concentration right this like</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.159" end="01:35:55.440" style="s2">it branches pretty fast then we have all</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.520" end="01:35:57.440" style="s2">the like the increase in domestic</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.440" end="01:36:00.800" style="s2">abuse happening</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.440" end="01:36:01.760" style="s2">like really kind of gruesome spousal and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.800" end="01:36:03.280" style="s2">child abuse</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.760" end="01:36:04.960" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of up</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.280" end="01:36:07.040" style="s2">people in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.960" end="01:36:10.000" style="s2">a lot of the way that people survive is</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.040" end="01:36:11.679" style="s2">by avoiding their family</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.000" end="01:36:13.280" style="s2">and under this situation where they</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.679" end="01:36:14.880" style="s2">can&#39;t you get increasing those types of</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.280" end="01:36:17.199" style="s2">violence so then</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.880" end="01:36:19.119" style="s2">what happens also when like the people</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.199" end="01:36:20.400" style="s2">in new york or in italy know</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.119" end="01:36:22.800" style="s2">everybody knows a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.400" end="01:36:24.239" style="s2">died so you have like generational</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.800" end="01:36:25.840" style="s2">trauma like happened with a great</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.239" end="01:36:27.920" style="s2">depression or a war or whatever so then</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.840" end="01:36:28.719" style="s2">what are the lasting societal effects of</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.920" end="01:36:31.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.719" end="01:36:33.280" style="s2">lasting societal effects of um</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.160" end="01:36:36.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.280" end="01:36:37.840" style="s2">you know of existential fear and of kind</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.080" end="01:36:38.560" style="s2">of more ubiquitous trauma what happens</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.840" end="01:36:40.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.560" end="01:36:42.960" style="s2">a generation of kids who all lose a</p>

<p begin="01:36:42.960" end="01:36:49.920" style="s2">um lots of lots of things like this</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.440" end="01:36:50.880" style="s2">the domestic elections in the us are not</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.920" end="01:36:52.480" style="s2">secure</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.880" end="01:36:54.239" style="s2">at this point cannot be considered</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.480" end="01:36:56.000" style="s2">secure when</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.239" end="01:36:58.560" style="s2">trillions of dollars of new money just</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.000" end="01:37:02.400" style="s2">get made up like what is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.560" end="01:37:04.320" style="s2">and and i don&#39;t think anyone thinks</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.400" end="01:37:05.119" style="s2">those will be really rightly distributed</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.320" end="01:37:10.639" style="s2">to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.119" end="01:37:12.560" style="s2">right um and but unlike in 2008</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.639" end="01:37:14.159" style="s2">they didn&#39;t all go to the big bank usual</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.560" end="01:37:16.080" style="s2">brokers they went to</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.159" end="01:37:17.840" style="s2">some new brokers that seem to be more</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.080" end="01:37:20.480" style="s2">associated with the kind of current</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.840" end="01:37:22.239" style="s2">insurgency that&#39;s in the white house</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.480" end="01:37:23.600" style="s2">rather than the establishment forces so</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.239" end="01:37:25.679" style="s2">you also see like</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.600" end="01:37:26.880" style="s2">competition at the very top of global</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.679" end="01:37:30.000" style="s2">and u.s finance</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.880" end="01:37:32.880" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s different so what how do</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.000" end="01:37:34.320" style="s2">those shocks ripple out</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.880" end="01:37:35.760" style="s2">we could go into any of those you want</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.320" end="01:37:37.119" style="s2">but this is just giving examples of</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.760" end="01:37:38.719" style="s2">starting to think about</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.119" end="01:37:40.400" style="s2">what second and third order and</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.719" end="01:37:41.840" style="s2">cascading effects look like and what</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.400" end="01:37:44.239" style="s2">cascading effects</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.840" end="01:37:47.199" style="s2">on systemic fragility looks like because</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.239" end="01:37:49.199" style="s2">if you had where all the countries</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.199" end="01:37:51.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t need import or export right they</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.199" end="01:37:54.400" style="s2">had fully domestic economies</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.600" end="01:37:56.000" style="s2">well it wouldn&#39;t be quite the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.400" end="01:37:56.320" style="s2">when you have globalized supply chains</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.000" end="01:37:57.679" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.320" end="01:38:00.239" style="s2">every single country in the world</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.679" end="01:38:01.280" style="s2">depends upon six continent type supply</p>

<p begin="01:38:01.280" end="01:38:05.679" style="s2">and where you have tensions all over the</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.600" end="01:38:07.280" style="s2">place and you have very powerful weapons</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.679" end="01:38:07.840" style="s2">associated with the tensions and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.280" end="01:38:09.840" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.840" end="01:38:11.760" style="s2">technologies that radically concentrate</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.840" end="01:38:12.960" style="s2">power like digital metcalf law type</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.760" end="01:38:15.360" style="s2">stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.960" end="01:38:16.800" style="s2">so we&#39;re dealing with and you know i</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.360" end="01:38:18.400" style="s2">would say if it wasn&#39;t coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.800" end="01:38:19.360" style="s2">something else would have done the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.400" end="01:38:22.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.360" end="01:38:23.520" style="s2">it could have easily been like the fires</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.159" end="01:38:26.000" style="s2">that happened in australia</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.520" end="01:38:27.600" style="s2">that were partly related to the climate</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.000" end="01:38:31.040" style="s2">that was dry and hot</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.600" end="01:38:33.360" style="s2">that dry hot thing similarly hitting</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.040" end="01:38:34.239" style="s2">india and driving food death there for</p>

<p begin="01:38:34.239" end="01:38:37.440" style="s2">could have led to this whole thing or</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.000" end="01:38:39.199" style="s2">what was happening in the amazon that</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.440" end="01:38:40.000" style="s2">could break the hydrological pump and</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.199" end="01:38:42.159" style="s2">affect the</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.000" end="01:38:44.000" style="s2">rainfall for north america basically we</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.159" end="01:38:45.920" style="s2">just needed something big enough</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.000" end="01:38:47.360" style="s2">to start to set off the systemic</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.920" end="01:38:49.199" style="s2">fragilities</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.360" end="01:38:50.560" style="s2">the systemic abilities haven&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.199" end="01:38:52.400" style="s2">been there because it&#39;s unique to</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.560" end="01:38:55.520" style="s2">globalization</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.400" end="01:38:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s unique to</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.520" end="01:38:59.840" style="s2">you know up until world war ii we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.520" end="01:39:00.800" style="s2">have technology big enough to up</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.840" end="01:39:02.800" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.800" end="01:39:04.480" style="s2">like we tried to up everything like</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.800" end="01:39:05.920" style="s2">that you look at genghis khan and</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.480" end="01:39:07.840" style="s2">alexander the great and the romans like</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.920" end="01:39:09.360" style="s2">we would use our technology to</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.840" end="01:39:12.560" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.360" end="01:39:14.000" style="s2">for personal gain and but how much stuff</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.560" end="01:39:15.760" style="s2">we could destroy was limited by how</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.000" end="01:39:16.880" style="s2">powerful we were world war ii was when</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.760" end="01:39:18.480" style="s2">we were like oh we actually have the</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.880" end="01:39:21.840" style="s2">power to make the whole</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.480" end="01:39:24.719" style="s2">place uninhabitable well in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.840" end="01:39:27.119" style="s2">time that&#39;s just like a minute ago</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.719" end="01:39:29.119" style="s2">and we made this entire world system the</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.119" end="01:39:29.760" style="s2">whole bretton woods world the world bank</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.119" end="01:39:31.840" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.760" end="01:39:33.360" style="s2">u.n and everything to make sure we never</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.840" end="01:39:35.840" style="s2">used that power</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.360" end="01:39:38.320" style="s2">right that we didn&#39;t use the nukes again</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.840" end="01:39:40.000" style="s2">but nukes are super hard to make</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.320" end="01:39:41.440" style="s2">right your enriching uranium is super</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.000" end="01:39:43.040" style="s2">hard to do you can monitor it from</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.440" end="01:39:44.480" style="s2">satellites the uranium doesn&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.040" end="01:39:46.960" style="s2">that many places</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.480" end="01:39:48.719" style="s2">and so when you have two superpowers and</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.960" end="01:39:50.480" style="s2">one catastrophe weapon</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.719" end="01:39:52.560" style="s2">you can do mutually assured destruction</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.480" end="01:39:54.000" style="s2">and make sure nobody uses it</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.560" end="01:39:56.239" style="s2">but when you start getting to drone</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.000" end="01:39:58.159" style="s2">weapons and ai controlled drone weapons</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.239" end="01:40:01.360" style="s2">and bio weapons and</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.159" end="01:40:02.960" style="s2">um all of the other kind of exponential</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.360" end="01:40:04.480" style="s2">tech media weapons that are not that</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.960" end="01:40:05.760" style="s2">hard to make</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.480" end="01:40:07.760" style="s2">and you have a world today where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.760" end="01:40:08.000" style="s2">got dozens of catastrophe weapons held</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.760" end="01:40:10.480" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.000" end="01:40:13.360" style="s2">many dozens of actors that can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.480" end="01:40:13.360" style="s2">all be monitored</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.679" end="01:40:20.239" style="s2">you can&#39;t do mutual destruction on that</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.960" end="01:40:22.000" style="s2">and when bretton woods happened</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.239" end="01:40:23.360" style="s2">we weren&#39;t near the planetary limits of</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.000" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">growth we hadn&#39;t already taken</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.360" end="01:40:27.040" style="s2">most of the fish out of the ocean or</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:28.639" style="s2"> up the coral or got close to the</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.040" end="01:40:29.760" style="s2">tipping points on the amazon or any of</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.639" end="01:40:32.800" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.760" end="01:40:34.400" style="s2">so we could just say let&#39;s just base</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.800" end="01:40:36.080" style="s2">finance ourselves out of this by</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.400" end="01:40:37.280" style="s2">printing so much money and</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.080" end="01:40:38.639" style="s2">exploiting whatever we need you to print</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.280" end="01:40:39.840" style="s2">so much money that we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.639" end="01:40:42.000" style="s2">fight because we just keep</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.840" end="01:40:43.840" style="s2">having so much positive some growth you</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.000" end="01:40:45.840" style="s2">don&#39;t get to do that forever</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.840" end="01:40:47.520" style="s2">right so we really are at a tipping</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.840" end="01:40:50.800" style="s2">point where</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.520" end="01:40:52.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.800" end="01:40:54.000" style="s2">and that creates its own fragility we</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.480" end="01:40:55.199" style="s2">have these globalized supply chains</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.000" end="01:40:56.639" style="s2">where collapse anywhere can create</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.199" end="01:40:58.400" style="s2">collapse in other places we saw a little</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.639" end="01:41:01.119" style="s2"> problem in wuhan and the whole</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.400" end="01:41:05.600" style="s2">world is affected right so</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.119" end="01:41:07.440" style="s2">radically interconnected world and</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.600" end="01:41:08.880" style="s2">where too many people have too big a</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.440" end="01:41:11.920" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.880" end="01:41:15.199" style="s2">and not just the kinetic weapons but</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.920" end="01:41:17.040" style="s2">even the effect on everyone&#39;s psyche of</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.199" end="01:41:20.159" style="s2">technologies like facebook</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.040" end="01:41:21.119" style="s2">and google that either we&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.159" end="01:41:23.280" style="s2">powerful enough</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.119" end="01:41:25.760" style="s2">relative to the now smallness of our</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.280" end="01:41:28.239" style="s2">world and our own developmental</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.760" end="01:41:29.679" style="s2">innate capacities that we either figure</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.239" end="01:41:31.600" style="s2">out how to use that power</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.679" end="01:41:34.400" style="s2">much much much better or we blow</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.600" end="01:41:34.400" style="s2">ourselves up with it</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.679" end="01:41:40.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s the omni lose-lose scenario</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.920" end="01:41:43.199" style="s2">you&#39;ve been talking about around</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.400" end="01:41:45.679" style="s2">that in the end if you keep enforcing</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.199" end="01:41:48.639" style="s2">the win-lose scenarios of one</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.679" end="01:41:50.239" style="s2">one party trying to advance at the cost</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.639" end="01:41:52.000" style="s2">of the other it&#39;s just eventually going</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.239" end="01:41:54.880" style="s2">to lead to us destroying</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.000" end="01:41:57.600" style="s2">the place we live in basically yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.880" end="01:42:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s why it needs change</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.600" end="01:42:04.880" style="s2">yeah there is a you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.360" end="01:42:08.719" style="s2">that kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.880" end="01:42:10.000" style="s2">win-lose game theory not only</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.719" end="01:42:12.000" style="s2">like the first thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.000" end="01:42:13.360" style="s2">historically it actually worked like we</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.000" end="01:42:14.800" style="s2">actually could kill the other guys and</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.360" end="01:42:16.400" style="s2">get the riverfront property that they</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.800" end="01:42:18.320" style="s2">had and that was awesome right</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.400" end="01:42:21.920" style="s2">and then they stopped competing with us</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.320" end="01:42:23.600" style="s2">for for hunting and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.920" end="01:42:25.040" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t just that it worked it was</p>

<p begin="01:42:25.040" end="01:42:28.159" style="s2">because if we just wanted to be peaceful</p>

<p begin="01:42:28.159" end="01:42:31.600" style="s2">they&#39;re going out killing other tribes</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.080" end="01:42:33.760" style="s2">and taking their</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.600" end="01:42:35.600" style="s2">then we have to militarize ourselves to</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.760" end="01:42:37.440" style="s2">defend ourselves or we lose by default</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.600" end="01:42:38.000" style="s2">as soon as anyone militarizes which is</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.440" end="01:42:39.520" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.000" end="01:42:42.239" style="s2">some of the more peaceful cultures just</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.520" end="01:42:44.639" style="s2">got slaughtered by the warring cultures</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.239" end="01:42:46.000" style="s2">and the effective warring cultures</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.639" end="01:42:47.840" style="s2">taught each other to war better and you</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.000" end="01:42:48.960" style="s2">get this upregulation of war capacity</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.840" end="01:42:50.239" style="s2">where anybody comes out with a new</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.960" end="01:42:51.679" style="s2">weapon and everybody has to create</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.239" end="01:42:52.159" style="s2">counter weapons and new better weapons</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.679" end="01:42:54.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.159" end="01:42:55.679" style="s2">so you get this but ultimately that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.480" end="01:42:57.679" style="s2">exponential curve</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.679" end="01:42:59.920" style="s2">that drives an exponential curve and</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.679" end="01:43:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all externalizing harm on a finite</p>

<p begin="01:43:02.400" end="01:43:05.920" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve been in a place where like</p>

<p begin="01:43:05.920" end="01:43:09.360" style="s2">what has worked and has even been</p>

<p begin="01:43:09.360" end="01:43:16.880" style="s2">as a mode itself will now create</p>

<p begin="01:43:16.880" end="01:43:23.520" style="s2">we need a fundamentally different</p>

<p begin="01:45:10.480" end="01:45:16.000" style="s2">had a series of processes uh in my life</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.920" end="01:45:17.760" style="s2">of realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.000" end="01:45:19.199" style="s2">things that i cared about and wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.760" end="01:45:20.480" style="s2">solve were connected to other things</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.199" end="01:45:22.400" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t know that i cared about</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.480" end="01:45:22.880" style="s2">but that also had to be solved until it</p>

<p begin="01:45:22.880" end="01:45:25.520" style="s2">it came to</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.800" end="01:45:30.000" style="s2">if i try to stop these animals from</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.280" end="01:45:31.679" style="s2">being poached by</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.000" end="01:45:32.800" style="s2">putting bigger fences but the poachers</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.679" end="01:45:33.679" style="s2">are still broke and have the same</p>

<p begin="01:45:33.679" end="01:45:36.880" style="s2">poach some other animal that might even</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.119" end="01:45:39.600" style="s2">be more endangered right like</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.880" end="01:45:41.119" style="s2">how in order to really address it we</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.600" end="01:45:42.639" style="s2">have to actually address</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.119" end="01:45:46.719" style="s2">not only the interconnectedness but what</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.639" end="01:45:50.000" style="s2">are the driving functions underneath it</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.719" end="01:45:53.280" style="s2">and i also went through the process of</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.000" end="01:45:54.960" style="s2">trying to like assuming at first naively</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.280" end="01:45:56.880" style="s2">that there were approaches already in</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.960" end="01:45:59.840" style="s2">place that were probably good</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.880" end="01:46:01.760" style="s2">or adequate that started with activism</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.840" end="01:46:02.400" style="s2">you know in the kind of ngo world and</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.760" end="01:46:04.880" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.400" end="01:46:06.320" style="s2">kind of looking at the maybe un igo</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.880" end="01:46:08.159" style="s2">world and then seeing if maybe there</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.320" end="01:46:10.000" style="s2">were economic solutions if the austrian</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.159" end="01:46:11.600" style="s2">school or the anarcho-capitalist figured</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.000" end="01:46:12.719" style="s2">it out or if the scandinavian model</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.600" end="01:46:16.080" style="s2">could apply</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.719" end="01:46:17.520" style="s2">or the um permaculture for the whole</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.080" end="01:46:19.760" style="s2">world whatever right like</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.520" end="01:46:21.520" style="s2">and it was clear that they all had some</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.760" end="01:46:23.440" style="s2">good partial insights but it could run</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.520" end="01:46:24.960" style="s2">the fail cases of why no this</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.440" end="01:46:26.960" style="s2">this actually isn&#39;t a solution for this</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.960" end="01:46:28.239" style="s2">whole problem set</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.960" end="01:46:29.840" style="s2">so i kept trying to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.239" end="01:46:31.360" style="s2">nature of the problems better to be able</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.840" end="01:46:32.080" style="s2">to see what would an adequate solution</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.360" end="01:46:36.480" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.080" end="01:46:36.480" style="s2">or a set of solutions and</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.040" end="01:46:41.119" style="s2">and the question like a central question</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.280" end="01:46:45.119" style="s2">is always very orienting is what is</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.119" end="01:46:47.040" style="s2">most needed for civilization and life to</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.119" end="01:46:48.560" style="s2">thrive that is not being tended to</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.040" end="01:46:51.760" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.560" end="01:46:53.199" style="s2">and that both is looking that requires a</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.760" end="01:46:56.320" style="s2">clear sense of what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.199" end="01:46:58.400" style="s2">right it requires what understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.320" end="01:46:59.840" style="s2">the current problems and the future risk</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.400" end="01:47:02.239" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.840" end="01:47:02.960" style="s2">and both what isn&#39;t addressed and what</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.239" end="01:47:06.719" style="s2">the highest</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.960" end="01:47:06.719" style="s2">leverage types of things are in that</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.840" end="01:47:11.600" style="s2">stack would say that there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.440" end="01:47:14.000" style="s2">three primary horizons in my current</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.600" end="01:47:14.000" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.480" end="01:47:20.000" style="s2">uh there&#39;s what you can think of as the</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.760" end="01:47:21.600" style="s2">nearer term stuff</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.000" end="01:47:23.920" style="s2">which is that there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.600" end="01:47:26.159" style="s2">catastrophic risks</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.920" end="01:47:27.360" style="s2">that if they happen we won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.159" end="01:47:29.840" style="s2">reverse</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.360" end="01:47:31.280" style="s2">and they&#39;ll just suck so bad we must do</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.840" end="01:47:31.679" style="s2">everything we can to have them not</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.280" end="01:47:35.600" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.679" end="01:47:38.800" style="s2">and they&#39;re currently eminent or</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.600" end="01:47:42.080" style="s2">um have high enough probability that</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.800" end="01:47:43.679" style="s2">the probability is radically lowered and</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.080" end="01:47:45.600" style="s2">even though they&#39;re being driven by</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.600" end="01:47:48.159" style="s2">by perverse incentive within the nature</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.520" end="01:47:51.119" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.159" end="01:47:52.480" style="s2">how our market and government systems</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.119" end="01:47:54.320" style="s2">interact and they&#39;re being driven by</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.480" end="01:47:55.840" style="s2">poor sense-making and</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.320" end="01:47:57.840" style="s2">political power games whatever we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.840" end="01:48:00.080" style="s2">going to be able to fix those underlying</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.840" end="01:48:03.440" style="s2">systems fast enough we just have to</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.080" end="01:48:06.560" style="s2">solve these things kind of directly</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.440" end="01:48:07.840" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a whole set of ecological</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.560" end="01:48:08.800" style="s2">things that are actually pretty near</p>

<p begin="01:48:08.800" end="01:48:12.480" style="s2">where without fixing the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.880" end="01:48:14.719" style="s2">systems that generate the problem we</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.480" end="01:48:16.560" style="s2">just have to keep them from happening</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.719" end="01:48:18.000" style="s2">we need to keep large-scale war from</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.560" end="01:48:20.000" style="s2">happening we need to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.000" end="01:48:21.520" style="s2">the very large-scale refugee</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.000" end="01:48:23.760" style="s2">issues that could happen in the next</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.520" end="01:48:25.199" style="s2">little while there&#39;s some grid stability</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.760" end="01:48:28.159" style="s2">grid collapse stuff right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.199" end="01:48:28.159" style="s2">handful of things like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.440" end="01:48:32.880" style="s2">there&#39;s also certain kinds of power</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.119" end="01:48:34.880" style="s2">consolidation that if they happen we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.880" end="01:48:37.040" style="s2">probably never get out of</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.880" end="01:48:39.440" style="s2">and that are really bad so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.040" end="01:48:42.480" style="s2">keep some of those things from happening</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.440" end="01:48:43.440" style="s2">so this is the like triage bucket it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.480" end="01:48:45.040" style="s2">pretty big bucket</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.440" end="01:48:47.040" style="s2">right like any one of those pretty big</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.040" end="01:48:48.639" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s how do we identify</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.040" end="01:48:50.480" style="s2">all the ways that humanity could go off</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.639" end="01:48:52.800" style="s2">the rails near term</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.480" end="01:48:54.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of risk assessment to</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.800" end="01:48:55.760" style="s2">be able to see what the escalation</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.320" end="01:48:57.360" style="s2">pathways to various kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.760" end="01:49:00.320" style="s2">irreversible risks are and say how do we</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.360" end="01:49:02.639" style="s2">close those</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.320" end="01:49:04.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a another thing that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.639" end="01:49:06.320" style="s2">happening simultaneous</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.159" end="01:49:08.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a slightly longer arc which is</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.320" end="01:49:11.040" style="s2">institutional change how do we work with</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.320" end="01:49:14.080" style="s2">the existing institutions to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.040" end="01:49:17.119" style="s2">have them be more oriented in</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.080" end="01:49:18.880" style="s2">effective directions so how can we make</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.119" end="01:49:20.800" style="s2">certain perverse incentives within</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.880" end="01:49:21.520" style="s2">markets less incentivized what could we</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.800" end="01:49:23.920" style="s2">do to make</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.520" end="01:49:25.119" style="s2"> up things more expensive and what</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.920" end="01:49:26.800" style="s2">could we do to make things that would be</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.119" end="01:49:28.639" style="s2">really good more profitable right can we</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.800" end="01:49:30.159" style="s2">change the topology of the incentive</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.639" end="01:49:31.760" style="s2">landscape where still</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.159" end="01:49:33.599" style="s2">incentive seeking capitalism would</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.760" end="01:49:36.880" style="s2">incent different things</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.599" end="01:49:39.440" style="s2">and within governments</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.880" end="01:49:41.360" style="s2">can we do things that force higher kinds</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.440" end="01:49:44.480" style="s2">of transparency</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.360" end="01:49:45.360" style="s2">and accountability that decrease the</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.480" end="01:49:46.960" style="s2">corruption</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.360" end="01:49:49.360" style="s2">and kind of self-dealing and crony</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.960" end="01:49:50.800" style="s2">capitalism and regulatory capture</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.360" end="01:49:53.440" style="s2">well it turns out that there is quite a</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.800" end="01:49:57.199" style="s2">lot that can be done in those spaces</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.440" end="01:50:00.560" style="s2">and for reasons that will take</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.199" end="01:50:03.520" style="s2">more time than we have today i</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.560" end="01:50:05.360" style="s2">i will say that the very best we could</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.520" end="01:50:07.760" style="s2">do in that still won&#39;t be long-term</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.360" end="01:50:09.760" style="s2">adequate that the underlying axioms the</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.760" end="01:50:10.639" style="s2">underlying structures of those systems</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.760" end="01:50:13.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.639" end="01:50:14.960" style="s2">right but the new systems that we would</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.440" end="01:50:18.159" style="s2">want to build from scratch will</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.960" end="01:50:18.639" style="s2">take quite a while and so we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.159" end="01:50:20.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.639" end="01:50:21.040" style="s2">vectoring these systems in the right</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.000" end="01:50:22.159" style="s2">direction because they&#39;re the systems</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.040" end="01:50:25.360" style="s2">that still run the world right</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.159" end="01:50:26.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve got 50 or 100 trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.360" end="01:50:30.000" style="s2">that trades hands every day</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.719" end="01:50:31.599" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a lot of total activity</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.000" end="01:50:33.040" style="s2">we have to start vectoring that thing in</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.599" end="01:50:34.400" style="s2">the right direction as we work on new</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.040" end="01:50:35.119" style="s2">economic systems that might not be</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.400" end="01:50:38.320" style="s2">measured in</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.119" end="01:50:39.840" style="s2">single fungible currencies so</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.320" end="01:50:41.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the second category is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.840" end="01:50:44.880" style="s2">existing institutional change</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.760" end="01:50:47.119" style="s2">the third one is build new new</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.880" end="01:50:50.159" style="s2">civilization systems from scratch that</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.119" end="01:50:52.719" style="s2">are reverse engineered from defining</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.159" end="01:50:54.639" style="s2">the problem set well enough so we</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.719" end="01:50:56.000" style="s2">identify all the catastrophic risks that</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.639" end="01:50:57.599" style="s2">could happen especially as we have</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.000" end="01:50:58.960" style="s2">increasing technological power and</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.599" end="01:51:00.320" style="s2">that power means the ability to do good</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.960" end="01:51:01.599" style="s2"> and up stuff but the</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.320" end="01:51:02.400" style="s2">up stuff kind of ruins the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.599" end="01:51:05.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.400" end="01:51:07.920" style="s2">so um one war</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.599" end="01:51:09.520" style="s2">ruins everybody&#39;s ability who died to do</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.920" end="01:51:11.040" style="s2">poetry and art and all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.520" end="01:51:14.320" style="s2">things right</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.040" end="01:51:14.320" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.719" end="01:51:18.960" style="s2">there is a entropic orientation right</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.119" end="01:51:20.080" style="s2">there&#39;s an asymmetry that makes entropy</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.960" end="01:51:21.599" style="s2">easier</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.080" end="01:51:23.599" style="s2">just easier to break than it is to</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.599" end="01:51:27.360" style="s2">build it and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.599" end="01:51:28.560" style="s2">um so if we identify well what are all</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.360" end="01:51:29.760" style="s2">of the ways</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.560" end="01:51:31.920" style="s2">all the kind of catastrophic and</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.760" end="01:51:32.239" style="s2">existential risks what are the things</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.920" end="01:51:34.639" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.239" end="01:51:36.320" style="s2">lead us to making those things happen</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.639" end="01:51:37.520" style="s2">what are the system dynamics and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.320" end="01:51:39.520" style="s2">incentives and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.520" end="01:51:41.760" style="s2">whatever so we call those the generator</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.520" end="01:51:44.159" style="s2">functions of existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.760" end="01:51:45.599" style="s2">and then rather than try to solve this</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.159" end="01:51:47.280" style="s2">one and this one and this one separately</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.599" end="01:51:48.960" style="s2">can we actually solve those generator</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.280" end="01:51:50.880" style="s2">functions categorically which would</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.960" end="01:51:53.280" style="s2">solve every instance in the class</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.880" end="01:51:55.520" style="s2">as a new instantiation of a civilization</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.280" end="01:51:59.360" style="s2">kernel can we have a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.520" end="01:52:01.440" style="s2">the architecture of the economics has</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.360" end="01:52:03.040" style="s2">removed perverse incentive fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.440" end="01:52:06.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s removed the</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.040" end="01:52:06.719" style="s2">evolutionary niche for sociopathic</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.080" end="01:52:08.080" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.719" end="01:52:10.159" style="s2">right maybe it&#39;s where there&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.080" end="01:52:12.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t ever pay um</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.159" end="01:52:14.080" style="s2">or corruption through the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.000" end="01:52:15.599" style="s2">transparency and accounting and justice</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.080" end="01:52:18.239" style="s2">and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.599" end="01:52:20.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s been a focus of mine for a</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.239" end="01:52:21.920" style="s2">bunch of years because if we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.000" end="01:52:22.800" style="s2">get that that totally recalibrated my</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.920" end="01:52:26.159" style="s2">sense of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.800" end="01:52:27.840" style="s2">possibility space and so i was fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.159" end="01:52:30.080" style="s2">to have some really</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.840" end="01:52:30.880" style="s2">incredible people colleagues worked</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.080" end="01:52:33.440" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.880" end="01:52:35.440" style="s2">for quite some years on that and came to</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.440" end="01:52:36.480" style="s2">yes it is actually possible there are</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.440" end="01:52:38.000" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.480" end="01:52:41.199" style="s2">if we ask the question how do we make a</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.000" end="01:52:44.320" style="s2">world that&#39;s anti-fragile civilization</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.199" end="01:52:46.159" style="s2">in presence of having exponential</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.320" end="01:52:46.800" style="s2">technology kind of available to</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.159" end="01:52:50.400" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.800" end="01:52:53.440" style="s2">decentralized exponential technology</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.400" end="01:52:56.159" style="s2">factoring the way that humans are</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.440" end="01:52:57.760" style="s2">right so the kinds of beings that we</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.159" end="01:52:58.400" style="s2">have been and how we have been stewards</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.760" end="01:53:00.960" style="s2">of power</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.400" end="01:53:03.760" style="s2">can that many of us have that much power</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.960" end="01:53:05.520" style="s2">and have the thing be anti-fragile</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.760" end="01:53:08.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a tough problem right it was not</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.520" end="01:53:11.199" style="s2">obvious revolution to it</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.159" end="01:53:13.199" style="s2">and but we did end up coming up with yes</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.199" end="01:53:15.040" style="s2">there is actually a field of solutions</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.199" end="01:53:16.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t look like any of the systems</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.040" end="01:53:17.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried so far which makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.480" end="01:53:19.760" style="s2">right they don&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.679" end="01:53:20.960" style="s2">nation-state-based liberal democracy or</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.760" end="01:53:22.960" style="s2">communism or</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.960" end="01:53:26.320" style="s2">socially they look like some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.960" end="01:53:29.599" style="s2">deeply reimagined premises but</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.320" end="01:53:31.679" style="s2">and so there&#39;s work happening to build</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.599" end="01:53:32.800" style="s2">those types of systems prototype them</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.679" end="01:53:35.040" style="s2">refine them</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.800" end="01:53:36.480" style="s2">to then be strange attractors of a new</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.040" end="01:53:38.880" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.480" end="01:53:40.719" style="s2">and the idea would be and and the</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.880" end="01:53:42.400" style="s2">fundamental basis of them is much higher</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.719" end="01:53:44.400" style="s2">collective intelligence that leads to</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.400" end="01:53:46.320" style="s2">better resource utilization and</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.400" end="01:53:48.400" style="s2">but because of that also leads to better</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.320" end="01:53:50.719" style="s2">innovation which also leads to them</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.400" end="01:53:52.560" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.719" end="01:53:54.560" style="s2">offer things to the world that the rest</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.560" end="01:53:56.400" style="s2">of the world needs so it engenders</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.560" end="01:53:57.679" style="s2">healthy relationship rather than enmity</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.400" end="01:53:59.760" style="s2">and being able to defend themselves</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.679" end="01:54:02.560" style="s2">without needing to go offensive and</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.760" end="01:54:02.560" style="s2">various things like that</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.920" end="01:54:07.920" style="s2">so then what we would expect is that if</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.560" end="01:54:09.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a radically more effective</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.920" end="01:54:10.560" style="s2">civilization system</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.199" end="01:54:12.800" style="s2">that other places would want to</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.560" end="01:54:17.360" style="s2">implement it and</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.800" end="01:54:19.840" style="s2">so you start to get a uh</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.360" end="01:54:20.840" style="s2">an adoption based on a new attractive</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.840" end="01:54:25.280" style="s2">basin</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.840" end="01:54:28.239" style="s2">right but that&#39;ll take a few generations</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.280" end="01:54:30.239" style="s2">somebody told me this story i have no</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.239" end="01:54:32.239" style="s2">idea if anybody ever thought this was</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.239" end="01:54:34.400" style="s2">true or not but the idea makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.239" end="01:54:36.080" style="s2">that in the exodus story when the people</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.400" end="01:54:38.159" style="s2">were leaving egypt and they took 40</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.080" end="01:54:42.320" style="s2">years to do like a one month long walk</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.159" end="01:54:44.639" style="s2">um what was that about the metaphor was</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.320" end="01:54:46.000" style="s2">that they needed a couple generations of</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.639" end="01:54:47.760" style="s2">people to die off for the slave</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.000" end="01:54:49.360" style="s2">mentality to be fully gone before</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.760" end="01:54:51.199" style="s2">starting a new civilization that</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.360" end="01:54:52.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t still slaves or the children of</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.199" end="01:54:53.920" style="s2">slaves</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.560" end="01:54:55.920" style="s2">and so there were some people that had</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.920" end="01:54:57.520" style="s2">enough wisdom to say oh these people</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.920" end="01:54:59.199" style="s2">are probably actually not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.520" end="01:55:00.800" style="s2">able to let that go</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.199" end="01:55:02.480" style="s2">and so we&#39;re going to like keep</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.800" end="01:55:05.119" style="s2">developing new people and</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.480" end="01:55:07.119" style="s2">at least as a metaphor there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.119" end="01:55:08.560" style="s2">of that there&#39;s a transition between one</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.119" end="01:55:10.560" style="s2">system and a new system and that</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.560" end="01:55:14.159" style="s2">transition requires some</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.560" end="01:55:15.760" style="s2">generational shift usually so</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.159" end="01:55:17.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why the that&#39;s why the second</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.760" end="01:55:18.960" style="s2">category the work with the current</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.679" end="01:55:19.920" style="s2">institutions to vector them in the right</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.960" end="01:55:21.520" style="s2">direction because we&#39;re going to need</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.920" end="01:55:22.880" style="s2">them for a while</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.520" end="01:55:24.880" style="s2">so i would say the things that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.880" end="01:55:27.360" style="s2">interested in kind of span those three</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.880" end="01:55:27.360" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.239" end="01:55:32.719" style="s2">and then you i uh i said in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.239" end="01:55:35.840" style="s2">beginning i want to keep it</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.719" end="01:55:38.000" style="s2">rather the 75 minutes but i</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.840" end="01:55:39.760" style="s2">i could ask you questions without end i</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.000" end="01:55:41.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s showcasing uh</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.760" end="01:55:44.840" style="s2">why we had a three-hour conversation</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.520" end="01:55:47.760" style="s2">back then in the restaurant as well</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.840" end="01:55:50.960" style="s2">um as a</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.760" end="01:55:52.960" style="s2">if you would have to um</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.960" end="01:55:55.119" style="s2">or like is there is there a message that</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.960" end="01:55:57.119" style="s2">you would like to share that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.119" end="01:55:58.800" style="s2">um that you feel passionate about or to</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.119" end="01:56:01.679" style="s2">the audience that you think</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.800" end="01:56:04.080" style="s2">you would like to leave as a last</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.679" end="01:56:04.080" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.119" end="01:56:15.360" style="s2">i can&#39;t say that this is the most</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.520" end="01:56:17.119" style="s2">important thing i could say but it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.360" end="01:56:18.719" style="s2">just the first thing that came to mind</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.119" end="01:56:20.080" style="s2">it was actually from a conversation i</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.719" end="01:56:23.520" style="s2">was having</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.080" end="01:56:25.920" style="s2">with a friend right before we got on</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.520" end="01:56:25.920" style="s2">the call</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.520" end="01:56:32.800" style="s2">um so we were talking about dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.520" end="01:56:36.800" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.800" end="01:56:36.800" style="s2">so here&#39;s one dialectic that is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.840" end="01:56:43.840" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.080" end="01:56:51.119" style="s2">so one of the traits of sociopathy</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.440" end="01:56:53.360" style="s2">is not feeling a whole</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.119" end="01:56:55.119" style="s2">category of negative emotions right not</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.360" end="01:56:56.239" style="s2">feeling remorse or guilt or shame when</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.119" end="01:56:57.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.239" end="01:56:59.920" style="s2">do something that hurts people which is</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.920" end="01:57:01.520" style="s2">why you&#39;re a sociopath or a</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.920" end="01:57:04.239" style="s2">psychopath or something in that cluster</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.520" end="01:57:11.840" style="s2">b kind of category</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.239" end="01:57:11.840" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.400" end="01:57:17.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.599" end="01:57:19.679" style="s2">that if people don&#39;t feel certain kinds</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.679" end="01:57:21.119" style="s2">of negative emotions they can cause lots</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.679" end="01:57:22.840" style="s2">more harm to other people</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.119" end="01:57:25.360" style="s2">right because they don&#39;t feel them</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.840" end="01:57:27.679" style="s2">vicariously</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.360" end="01:57:27.679" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.360" end="01:57:33.679" style="s2">this also tends to be why people who are</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.000" end="01:57:36.400" style="s2">oriented that way this is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.679" end="01:57:38.239" style="s2">story there&#39;s also innate power seeking</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.400" end="01:57:40.320" style="s2">tend to be in so much more positions of</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.239" end="01:57:43.280" style="s2">power it&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.320" end="01:57:44.719" style="s2">um people who don&#39;t want to harm anyone</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.280" end="01:57:46.480" style="s2">usually don&#39;t want to make the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.719" end="01:57:50.159" style="s2">decisions necessary</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.480" end="01:57:51.679" style="s2">to win at power games um</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.159" end="01:57:53.440" style="s2">where they don&#39;t just feel great that</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.679" end="01:57:54.880" style="s2">they beat out the competition that means</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.440" end="01:57:55.920" style="s2">lots of people can&#39;t feed their kids and</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.880" end="01:57:58.560" style="s2">got laid off and</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.920" end="01:57:59.119" style="s2">but you know they got a yacht um or the</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.560" end="01:58:01.920" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.119" end="01:58:01.920" style="s2">advanced or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.239" end="01:58:07.040" style="s2">now there&#39;s a lot of spiritual and</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.880" end="01:58:09.280" style="s2">philosophic and worldview ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.040" end="01:58:12.239" style="s2">make us a little bit like a sociopath</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.280" end="01:58:15.520" style="s2">they&#39;re ways of numbing out pain</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.239" end="01:58:17.199" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.520" end="01:58:18.560" style="s2">you know always wanting to look on the</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.199" end="01:58:20.639" style="s2">positive side</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.560" end="01:58:22.400" style="s2">of everything and look for the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.639" end="01:58:24.480" style="s2">silver lining where it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.400" end="01:58:26.000" style="s2">denial of pain it&#39;s not wanting to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.480" end="01:58:27.599" style="s2">with the reality of it and</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.000" end="01:58:29.040" style="s2">you see this when like someone is</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.599" end="01:58:30.719" style="s2">grieving the loss of someone close to</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.040" end="01:58:32.239" style="s2">them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.719" end="01:58:34.080" style="s2">hurt and the other person just can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.239" end="01:58:34.960" style="s2">with it and they instantly say well the</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.080" end="01:58:36.239" style="s2">good side is</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.960" end="01:58:37.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like shut the up</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.239" end="01:58:38.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not the wrong thing to be saying</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.920" end="01:58:41.360" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.960" end="01:58:41.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.599" end="01:58:48.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of people who feel the</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.280" end="01:58:51.199" style="s2">pain of the world or who feel</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.960" end="01:58:52.960" style="s2">authentic fear or concern at these types</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.199" end="01:58:55.920" style="s2">of risks i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.960" end="01:58:57.360" style="s2">and then they just get crippled right</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.920" end="01:58:59.599" style="s2">because they feel kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.360" end="01:59:01.599" style="s2">overwhelmed with uncertainty and fear</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.599" end="01:59:02.880" style="s2">and sadness and despair and anger and</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.599" end="01:59:06.080" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.880" end="01:59:09.679" style="s2">and so if it&#39;s the case that</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.080" end="01:59:13.040" style="s2">the people who</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.679" end="01:59:13.360" style="s2">see the world in a way that actually has</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.040" end="01:59:17.440" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.360" end="01:59:19.679" style="s2">connect to the harms of others less</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.440" end="01:59:21.199" style="s2">that that empowers them more and those</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.679" end="01:59:22.960" style="s2">who are connected to the harms of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.199" end="01:59:24.480" style="s2">world more are disempowered</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.960" end="01:59:26.639" style="s2">then the world will continue to be run</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.480" end="01:59:29.760" style="s2">by sociopaths</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.639" end="01:59:30.800" style="s2">and or people who at least have some</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.760" end="01:59:33.280" style="s2">world views that make them</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.800" end="01:59:34.000" style="s2">sociopath-like and that&#39;s a very bad</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.280" end="01:59:36.800" style="s2">equation</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.000" end="01:59:38.880" style="s2">right so we need to get on the other</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.800" end="01:59:40.480" style="s2">side of that thesis antithesis thing and</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.880" end="01:59:44.239" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.480" end="01:59:46.480" style="s2">how can i be how can i have a real</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.239" end="01:59:48.800" style="s2">assessment of the problems of the world</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.480" end="01:59:50.320" style="s2">a a real assessment of the risks of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.800" end="01:59:51.679" style="s2">world a real assessment of my own</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.320" end="01:59:55.119" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.679" end="01:59:58.400" style="s2">and actually be more empowered</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.119" end="02:00:01.040" style="s2">to act in service of the whole and</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.400" end="02:00:01.440" style="s2">courageously and in service of what i</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.040" end="02:00:05.040" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.440" end="02:00:07.119" style="s2">than before and it&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.040" end="02:00:09.199" style="s2">power right it&#39;s not the power of how do</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.119" end="02:00:12.480" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.199" end="02:00:14.560" style="s2">be an apex predator and not care when</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.480" end="02:00:16.400" style="s2">everyone else is just a prey animal that</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.560" end="02:00:18.960" style="s2">dies it&#39;s a how do i have the power to</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.400" end="02:00:23.199" style="s2">be a steward of the whole</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.960" end="02:00:25.119" style="s2">um that&#39;s possible it&#39;s not common</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.199" end="02:00:27.599" style="s2">but i would say it&#39;s both possible and</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.119" end="02:00:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the necessary new baseline state we</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.599" end="02:00:30.480" style="s2">need to not</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.880" end="02:00:32.239" style="s2">blow ourselves up with the amount of</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.480" end="02:00:34.639" style="s2">power we have</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.239" end="02:00:38.239" style="s2">and so if people can think about is the</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.639" end="02:00:40.800" style="s2">way that i&#39;m thinking about this</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.239" end="02:00:42.480" style="s2">increasing my sense of empowerment and</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.800" end="02:00:43.679" style="s2">increasing my sense of empathy and</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.480" end="02:00:45.599" style="s2">responsibility for the whole</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.679" end="02:00:47.840" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.599" end="02:00:49.520" style="s2">if it is not increasing both of them</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.840" end="02:00:55.840" style="s2">keep rethinking about it until you find</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.520" end="02:00:55.840" style="s2">a way that does</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.080" end="02:01:03.840" style="s2">which is to me similar to</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.400" end="02:01:04.480" style="s2">if you expand like i i feel every human</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.840" end="02:01:08.719" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.480" end="02:01:12.000" style="s2">thinking about themselves um</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.719" end="02:01:13.040" style="s2">and for me that is expanding that sense</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.000" end="02:01:15.520" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.040" end="02:01:16.080" style="s2">or or the things that we care about and</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.520" end="02:01:19.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.080" end="02:01:20.560" style="s2">if i try like if i only see myself and</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.280" end="02:01:21.040" style="s2">everything else i don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.560" end="02:01:23.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.040" end="02:01:24.639" style="s2">then i advance myself at the cost of</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.280" end="02:01:26.480" style="s2">everything around me</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.639" end="02:01:27.840" style="s2">but if i if that understanding of self</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.480" end="02:01:28.639" style="s2">if that level of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.840" end="02:01:31.119" style="s2">entailing</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.639" end="02:01:32.960" style="s2">everything around me as well and i</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.119" end="02:01:34.080" style="s2">understand that i&#39;m part of a system and</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.960" end="02:01:35.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.080" end="02:01:37.199" style="s2">i do the best if the system is doing the</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.920" end="02:01:39.280" style="s2">best then</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.199" end="02:01:41.040" style="s2">now i care and then i take</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.280" end="02:01:42.239" style="s2">responsibility for the hole rather than</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.040" end="02:01:46.560" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.239" end="02:01:48.560" style="s2">for a virtual line that i drew in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.560" end="02:01:50.560" style="s2">sand</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.560" end="02:01:52.320" style="s2">is that me is that along the lines of</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.560" end="02:01:54.080" style="s2">what you meant meant</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.320" end="02:01:56.960" style="s2">well you made one step but i want to go</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.080" end="02:02:00.719" style="s2">another step okay</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.960" end="02:02:00.719" style="s2">so the step that you made is</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.840" end="02:02:06.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.320" end="02:02:09.040" style="s2">intelligent and thoughtful reciprocal</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.400" end="02:02:09.040" style="s2">altruism</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.760" end="02:02:14.159" style="s2">reciprocal altruism is i do better when</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.320" end="02:02:15.760" style="s2">the system does better and the system</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.159" end="02:02:18.239" style="s2">other people so i&#39;ll help them because</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.760" end="02:02:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s good for me</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.239" end="02:02:22.239" style="s2">rather than i&#39;ll them because i get</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.920" end="02:02:23.840" style="s2">ahead i&#39;ll find ways that i can</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.239" end="02:02:26.639" style="s2">where i help them i get ahead but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.840" end="02:02:29.440" style="s2">still doing it for me</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.639" end="02:02:30.159" style="s2">i&#39;m still ultimately coming from a place</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.440" end="02:02:32.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.159" end="02:02:33.440" style="s2">focused on you know with them what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.880" end="02:02:36.320" style="s2">it for me</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.440" end="02:02:37.040" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of this um miserable needy</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.320" end="02:02:38.320" style="s2">thing that just</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.040" end="02:02:40.159" style="s2">needs to keep getting from the</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.320" end="02:02:42.080" style="s2">world needs to keep getting</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.159" end="02:02:43.520" style="s2">stuff and recognition and attention and</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.080" end="02:02:45.679" style="s2">whatever the it is</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.520" end="02:02:48.719" style="s2">and i will do things that are nice to</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.679" end="02:02:48.719" style="s2">the degree it gives me</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.840" end="02:02:53.679" style="s2">like that&#39;s a starting place that at</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.000" end="02:02:54.400" style="s2">least can make people less dreadful</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.679" end="02:02:57.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:02:54.400" end="02:02:59.920" style="s2">to begin with but</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.440" end="02:03:01.199" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually achieve anything like</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.920" end="02:03:02.719" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.199" end="02:03:04.159" style="s2">happiness as long as you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.719" end="02:03:05.760" style="s2">focused on what&#39;s in it for me because</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.159" end="02:03:07.760" style="s2">you&#39;re still affirming a self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.760" end="02:03:11.199" style="s2">empty</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.760" end="02:03:13.199" style="s2">right it&#39;s there is some sense of a</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.199" end="02:03:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a misunderstanding of self that is</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.199" end="02:03:18.480" style="s2">some sense that needs a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.880" end="02:03:20.080" style="s2">what you keep getting is more of that</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.480" end="02:03:20.400" style="s2">sense of self which means no matter how</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.080" end="02:03:21.840" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.400" end="02:03:24.639" style="s2"> that you get whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.840" end="02:03:26.960" style="s2">achievement or recognition or whatever</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.639" end="02:03:28.719" style="s2">that same kind of sense is there which</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.960" end="02:03:30.400" style="s2">is very different than the kind of</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.719" end="02:03:32.000" style="s2">desire that comes from a place of</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.400" end="02:03:34.960" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.000" end="02:03:37.360" style="s2">and and then connectedness to the world</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.960" end="02:03:39.280" style="s2">and then a recognition of the intrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.360" end="02:03:40.960" style="s2">meaningfulness of others lives not</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.280" end="02:03:42.239" style="s2">because supporting them will make your</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.960" end="02:03:44.560" style="s2">life better but just because</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.239" end="02:03:46.080" style="s2">their life actually matters to you</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.560" end="02:03:48.079" style="s2">because you actually give a for no</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.080" end="02:03:50.000" style="s2">selfish reason</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.079" end="02:03:51.760" style="s2">and like you can do this thought</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.000" end="02:03:54.000" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.760" end="02:03:55.920" style="s2">okay let&#39;s say that it was true that</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.000" end="02:03:58.000" style="s2">when i die i became a guardian angel or</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.920" end="02:03:59.760" style="s2">i had that possibility</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.000" end="02:04:01.040" style="s2">right i&#39;m not saying that&#39;s true it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.760" end="02:04:05.199" style="s2">thought experiment</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.040" end="02:04:08.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s say i had that and</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.199" end="02:04:10.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to do anything if i want to</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.400" end="02:04:12.320" style="s2">just chill in heaven and listen to music</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.800" end="02:04:15.280" style="s2">i can do that</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.320" end="02:04:16.639" style="s2">but i have the opportunity to affect</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.280" end="02:04:18.000" style="s2">people&#39;s lives in a positive way</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.639" end="02:04:18.719" style="s2">sometimes but they&#39;ll never know it i</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.000" end="02:04:21.119" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.719" end="02:04:24.000" style="s2">divert the the ball in the road where</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.119" end="02:04:27.119" style="s2">the kid doesn&#39;t get hit by the car</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.000" end="02:04:29.199" style="s2">this question comes do i ever do that</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.119" end="02:04:30.480" style="s2">do i ever bother having the kid not get</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.199" end="02:04:32.079" style="s2">hit by the car because i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.480" end="02:04:35.360" style="s2">get from it</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.079" end="02:04:37.599" style="s2">right well no i will get something i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.360" end="02:04:40.480" style="s2">get feeling better about myself</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.599" end="02:04:42.159" style="s2">well that also already has the the</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.480" end="02:04:43.760" style="s2">emptiness of like i don&#39;t feel good</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.159" end="02:04:48.079" style="s2">about myself</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.760" end="02:04:50.159" style="s2">and i have to do something like that no</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.079" end="02:04:51.199" style="s2">when that mom is crying watching her</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.159" end="02:04:54.480" style="s2">baby get</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.199" end="02:04:55.760" style="s2">hit and what like i feel it not because</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.480" end="02:04:57.679" style="s2">i need something or whatever but because</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.760" end="02:05:00.079" style="s2">i can resonate with that</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.679" end="02:05:01.599" style="s2">her experience is as deep to universe as</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.079" end="02:05:04.239" style="s2">mine is</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.599" end="02:05:06.239" style="s2">i&#39;m not the only focal point and if i</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.239" end="02:05:08.239" style="s2">and if i can</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.239" end="02:05:09.360" style="s2">and i can think about that kid&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.239" end="02:05:12.079" style="s2">and i can think about</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.360" end="02:05:13.360" style="s2">the whole universe experiencing itself</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.079" end="02:05:15.360" style="s2">through this kid</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.360" end="02:05:16.880" style="s2">in this in these unique ways and falling</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.360" end="02:05:18.719" style="s2">in love for the first time and</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.880" end="02:05:21.199" style="s2">when he becomes a parent or whatever and</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.719" end="02:05:22.719" style="s2">i&#39;m like that&#39;s just actually beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.199" end="02:05:25.920" style="s2">and i want to be in service to that for</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.719" end="02:05:29.280" style="s2">no obvious reason for me at all</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.920" end="02:05:31.760" style="s2">um i think the switch</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.280" end="02:05:33.360" style="s2">where people start to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.760" end="02:05:36.079" style="s2">wholeness that doesn&#39;t need a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.360" end="02:05:38.000" style="s2">stuff from other people in the world</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.079" end="02:05:39.760" style="s2">and then can from that place of</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.000" end="02:05:41.199" style="s2">wholeness actually show up to other</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.760" end="02:05:42.719" style="s2">people because you care about them not</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.199" end="02:05:45.040" style="s2">because you want to get something out of</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.719" end="02:05:49.840" style="s2">doing something for them</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.040" end="02:05:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s when life starts to me</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.040" end="02:05:58.000" style="s2">i find that a very</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.800" end="02:05:58.480" style="s2">um very very nice and interesting</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.000" end="02:06:00.400" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.480" end="02:06:02.400" style="s2">it was interesting when you said when</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.400" end="02:06:03.199" style="s2">you described it i was thinking okay but</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.400" end="02:06:08.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.199" end="02:06:10.400" style="s2">sense of self then isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.079" end="02:06:11.280" style="s2">um there&#39;s not not the separation</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.400" end="02:06:13.360" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.280" end="02:06:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re relate and</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.360" end="02:06:18.400" style="s2">if you empathize and if you feel then</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.840" end="02:06:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you experience them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.400" end="02:06:24.239" style="s2">more like it&#39;s kind of the same</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.840" end="02:06:25.440" style="s2">so now go back and read any scripture of</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.239" end="02:06:28.239" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.440" end="02:06:29.040" style="s2">and see that it was talking about that</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.239" end="02:06:31.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.040" end="02:06:33.599" style="s2">love thy neighbor as thyself not as much</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.040" end="02:06:37.520" style="s2">as what the does that mean</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.599" end="02:06:39.119" style="s2">right and or that the naming is the</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.520" end="02:06:40.639" style="s2">beginning of the ten thousand things in</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.119" end="02:06:43.599" style="s2">the dao tai ching</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.639" end="02:06:45.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s in okay i&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.599" end="02:06:47.520" style="s2">separate dude over here i&#39;m daniel</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.119" end="02:06:50.000" style="s2">you&#39;re you we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.520" end="02:06:51.760" style="s2">really i&#39;m daniel i&#39;m this is me this</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.000" end="02:06:53.840" style="s2">isn&#39;t me this isn&#39;t me is that</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.760" end="02:06:55.599" style="s2">okay so who the am i without the</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.840" end="02:06:56.239" style="s2">planet i&#39;m not the planet who am i</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.599" end="02:06:58.800" style="s2">without the planet</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.239" end="02:07:00.400" style="s2">i&#39;m nothing who am i without the</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.800" end="02:07:01.840" style="s2">atmosphere i&#39;m nothing who am i without</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.400" end="02:07:02.400" style="s2">the plants that make the atmosphere i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.840" end="02:07:04.639" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.400" end="02:07:06.400" style="s2">i have to take for granted that the</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.639" end="02:07:07.840" style="s2">thing that i call me depends on</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.400" end="02:07:09.520" style="s2">all this other stuff i have to take that</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.840" end="02:07:12.560" style="s2">for granted to say this is me</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.520" end="02:07:14.880" style="s2">but i don&#39;t exist without all of it</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.560" end="02:07:18.000" style="s2">so the idea of me is just actually an</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.880" end="02:07:19.840" style="s2">ontologically ill-formed idea</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.000" end="02:07:21.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s just a philosophically bad</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.840" end="02:07:24.840" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.920" end="02:07:26.079" style="s2">i am an emergent property of this</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.840" end="02:07:28.159" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.079" end="02:07:30.159" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s some autonomy but</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.159" end="02:07:31.679" style="s2">you try to take me as autonomous in the</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.159" end="02:07:33.679" style="s2">middle of outer space with nothing and i</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.679" end="02:07:36.639" style="s2">don&#39;t do that well</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.679" end="02:07:37.040" style="s2">right but but then there&#39;s a case uh to</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.639" end="02:07:40.480" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.040" end="02:07:44.639" style="s2">like if your understanding of me is</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.480" end="02:07:48.560" style="s2">all encumbering then you want me</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.639" end="02:07:50.079" style="s2">still to do well yeah</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.560" end="02:07:51.599" style="s2">right like it&#39;s just a different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.079" end="02:07:53.920" style="s2">just not daniel</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.599" end="02:07:56.400" style="s2">anymore but it&#39;s like everything and</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.920" end="02:07:58.159" style="s2">then that is the bodhisattva impulse or</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.400" end="02:07:59.679" style="s2">the chrystic impulse or the where the</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.159" end="02:08:01.840" style="s2">impulse to really</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.679" end="02:08:04.079" style="s2">serve life comes from it comes from</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.840" end="02:08:06.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.079" end="02:08:08.480" style="s2">like where the service impulse at first</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.960" end="02:08:11.280" style="s2">it comes from some</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.480" end="02:08:11.760" style="s2">like fear of hell or desire to please</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.280" end="02:08:14.960" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.760" end="02:08:16.719" style="s2">nasty god or projecting</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.960" end="02:08:18.239" style="s2">the desire for parental approval on the</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.719" end="02:08:18.719" style="s2">rest of the world or whatever like all</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.239" end="02:08:21.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.719" end="02:08:24.719" style="s2">child consciousness nonsense and then</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.920" end="02:08:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s even wanting to like</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.719" end="02:08:28.159" style="s2">respect myself and i have these values</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.960" end="02:08:29.840" style="s2">and i want to be the kind of person i</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.159" end="02:08:32.079" style="s2">respect okay that&#39;s fine those are steps</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.840" end="02:08:36.159" style="s2">they all serve a role</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.079" end="02:08:39.119" style="s2">but beyond that like when you read</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.159" end="02:08:40.560" style="s2">roomie or you read hafez or you read</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.119" end="02:08:42.800" style="s2">saint francis</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.560" end="02:08:45.599" style="s2">they were just in love with the</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.800" end="02:08:45.599" style="s2">beauty of the world</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.840" end="02:08:49.199" style="s2">they just loved the birds and the trees</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.480" end="02:08:51.440" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.199" end="02:08:53.599" style="s2">every they they saw the beauty of it and</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.440" end="02:08:55.599" style="s2">they were just in love with it</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.599" end="02:08:57.360" style="s2">and the desire to serve that which</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.599" end="02:09:00.159" style="s2">you&#39;re in love with is just a naturally</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.360" end="02:09:00.159" style="s2">arising thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.880" end="02:09:08.480" style="s2">that sounds awesome and this is now</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.119" end="02:09:12.639" style="s2">in fact perfective and perception</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.480" end="02:09:14.079" style="s2">is like when people do mushrooms when</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.639" end="02:09:15.280" style="s2">they do psilocybin one of the really</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.079" end="02:09:16.960" style="s2">interesting things is</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.280" end="02:09:18.480" style="s2">you can do a big dose of mushrooms where</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.960" end="02:09:19.040" style="s2">you&#39;re really tripping right and</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.480" end="02:09:20.400" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.040" end="02:09:22.400" style="s2">seeing colors that aren&#39;t there and</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.400" end="02:09:24.800" style="s2">shapes whatever but when you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.400" end="02:09:29.040" style="s2">smaller dose but you&#39;re clearly</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.800" end="02:09:32.639" style="s2">altered one of the neat experiences</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.040" end="02:09:34.079" style="s2">is you go outside and you look at a tree</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.639" end="02:09:36.159" style="s2">and you start crying because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.079" end="02:09:37.280" style="s2">beautiful and you sit there for an hour</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.159" end="02:09:38.560" style="s2">just looking at the tree and you feel</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.280" end="02:09:39.920" style="s2">like you could look at it for eternity</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.560" end="02:09:41.440" style="s2">and never see the tree fully because</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.920" end="02:09:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s so intricate and amazing and</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.440" end="02:09:44.840" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.320" end="02:09:46.480" style="s2">and then at a certain point you ask</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.840" end="02:09:48.400" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.480" end="02:09:49.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve walked by this tree a million times</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.400" end="02:09:51.679" style="s2">and never noticed it</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.760" end="02:09:53.440" style="s2">why is it so much more beautiful now</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.679" end="02:09:55.119" style="s2">you&#39;re like the tree&#39;s not purple it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.440" end="02:09:57.040" style="s2">still the same color it still looks like</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.119" end="02:09:59.440" style="s2">the same shape if i had to describe it</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.040" end="02:10:01.199" style="s2">i would use the same why is it so much</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.440" end="02:10:03.040" style="s2">more beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.199" end="02:10:04.719" style="s2">oh i&#39;m actually noticing it for the</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.040" end="02:10:07.360" style="s2">first time</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.719" end="02:10:08.239" style="s2">because i&#39;m not so busy with this</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.360" end="02:10:10.159" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.239" end="02:10:11.920" style="s2">sense that is trying to go get full in</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.159" end="02:10:13.199" style="s2">agendas and thinking about people and</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.920" end="02:10:14.560" style="s2">laundry lists and whatever that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.199" end="02:10:14.960" style="s2">actually just being present with and</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.560" end="02:10:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.960" end="02:10:19.119" style="s2">actually that beautiful and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.119" end="02:10:21.760" style="s2">neuroinhibitory function of certain</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.119" end="02:10:22.960" style="s2">brain regions that involve narrative</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.760" end="02:10:24.800" style="s2">that distracts us where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.960" end="02:10:26.400" style="s2">increased attention of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.800" end="02:10:28.000" style="s2">the sensory processes where</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.400" end="02:10:29.360" style="s2">if your senses if you really get to be</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.000" end="02:10:30.719" style="s2">with your sentences which is again why</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.360" end="02:10:32.000" style="s2">buddhist and taoist other techniques</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.719" end="02:10:32.880" style="s2">talk about really dropping into the</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.000" end="02:10:34.320" style="s2">senses</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.880" end="02:10:35.920" style="s2">is because when you can have your</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.320" end="02:10:38.719" style="s2">attention really with it the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.920" end="02:10:38.719" style="s2"> beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.159" end="02:10:46.320" style="s2">when you get that all violence the basis</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.119" end="02:10:46.320" style="s2">for all the violence is gone</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.360" end="02:10:50.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s probably one of the best</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.960" end="02:10:52.480" style="s2">ways to uh</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.800" end="02:10:53.920" style="s2">to end this the world is</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.480" end="02:10:57.199" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.920" end="02:10:59.040" style="s2">yeah and arising from that sense of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.199" end="02:11:01.280" style="s2">beauty is the desire to protect it</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.040" end="02:11:03.280" style="s2">and to serve it and add to it the</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.280" end="02:11:04.960" style="s2">artistic impulse</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.280" end="02:11:06.719" style="s2">is the desire to add to it right a lot</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.960" end="02:11:08.159" style="s2">of the humanitarian impulses the desire</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.719" end="02:11:10.960" style="s2">to protect it and serve it but they all</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.159" end="02:11:13.599" style="s2">arise out of seeing it</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.960" end="02:11:13.599" style="s2">recognizing</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.960" end="02:11:18.320" style="s2">awesome i i&#39;m really happy we took we</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.040" end="02:11:21.599" style="s2">took this turn in the end</p>
