<p begin="00:00:07.580" end="00:00:12.179" style="s2">hello you found the portal</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">I&#39;m your host Eric Weinstein and this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.179" end="00:00:16.260" style="s2">sort of an unusual edition of the portal</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s coming at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.260" end="00:00:20.340" style="s2">a new decade and I wanted to set some</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">intentions and also to sort of recap</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.340" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">where we&#39;ve been for the last half a</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">year that the show has been on the on</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">the air and on the internet there are no</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing planned what I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">do is to just try to speak directly</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:36.649" style="s2">about some of the things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">on my mind and give you all my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.649" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">on your feedback on the show and where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.640" style="s2">think we&#39;re going to be going to next so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">with with your permission let&#39;s begin</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.640" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">it&#39;s been a pretty interesting half of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">year the show has built up a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:53.730" style="s2">sizable audience and what&#39;s more there</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">are a lot of influential and important</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">voices within our audience so I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">that when I&#39;m speaking I&#39;m reaching a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">lot of the people who would be on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">dream list of people to interview to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">talk to and in fact to plot next steps</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">with so I think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">successful run of it we can still grow</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">the show bigger but the show is now</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">large enough that I actually don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">losing some of our listeners and some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">our viewers by going into more</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">challenging topics and so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">that our primary goal has is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:30.770" style="s2">building the audience quite as much as</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">it was during the first six months</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.770" end="00:01:35.579" style="s2">furthermore I think what&#39;s been somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">confusing is that we&#39;ve had if I recall</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.579" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">correctly 16 different interview</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">episodes and one solo episode so far and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">the portal was intended to be in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">you could argue that the portal has not</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:53.000" style="s2">even begun what we&#39;ve done is to build</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">up an audience and to habituate</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.000" end="00:01:58.740" style="s2">habituate the audience to a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">style of interaction I think we had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">figure out what we were going to do if</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">we wanted to bring you certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:08.039" style="s2">high-level concepts that often get lost</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">because the admonition to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.039" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t lose your audience along the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">way means that you never get very far</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">because you&#39;re always doing the sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:17.160" style="s2">of preliminary groundwork and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">never actually getting to the meat of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">the issue and I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">that we are very proud of is that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">have a very motivated audience who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">willing to sometimes even listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">show more than once or do it with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">notepad so that if there are unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">concepts they can be looked up and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">fact we&#39;ve noted that there have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">several communities springing up around</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">the show so that people can trade their</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">questions and we&#39;ve been watching you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:45.860" style="s2">guys answer each other&#39;s questions in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">way that&#39;s really been gratifying so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.860" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">having a lot of experts in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">has been a huge boon to the show and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:56.819" style="s2">hope to try to figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">community in a meaningful sense a larger</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.819" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">part of the show on a going-forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.140" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">basis one of those efforts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">particularly special is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">trying to enlist artists that can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:10.099" style="s2">visual artists it could be digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:14.849" style="s2">artists it could also be musicians and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.099" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2">the idea we have is that that Legion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.849" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">artists will be able to help push out</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">many of the higher-level ideas that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">would find challenging to do just in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:29.579" style="s2">speech by using sort of the the brains</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">full abilities to take in new</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.579" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">information and also to use the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:38.280" style="s2">the transcendent modality to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:40.829" style="s2">open hearts and minds to truly different</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.280" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">and unfamiliar ways of thinking so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.829" end="00:03:46.590" style="s2">think we may try to get that going</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">we need obviously to build a website we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">need to have some way in which people</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:54.389" style="s2">who wish to avoid advertising can can</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.709" end="00:03:55.799" style="s2">subscribe to the podcast and other</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.389" end="00:03:58.650" style="s2">people who want to contribute and be</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.799" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">part of this as a movement we just held</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.650" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">our first live show at the Ice House in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:06.389" style="s2">Pasadena and thanks everybody who came</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">out the show sold out extremely quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.389" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">even though we sort of didn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">advertise where and when it was except</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:16.039" style="s2">for cryptically at first and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">things that allowed us to do is to meet</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.039" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">the listenership on on Moss and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:25.870" style="s2">is it truly interesting and in many</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:27.880" style="s2">different ways diverse group of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.870" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">there were pretty even split between</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">auntie and pro-trump voices people got</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:36.130" style="s2">along great so we don&#39;t seem to be as</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:40.360" style="s2">affected as I was concerned we might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.130" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">by the election cycle and what I sensed</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.360" end="00:04:44.410" style="s2">was is that people really want to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:46.510" style="s2">the show to coalesce and come together</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.410" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a lot of fear at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.510" end="00:04:49.449" style="s2">moment about anything tribal or anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:52.930" style="s2">cult-like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.449" end="00:04:55.479" style="s2">and therefore anything that might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.930" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">tribal trades at a discount so I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.479" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">we might actually take a contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:03.370" style="s2">position and decide that the show in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:05.590" style="s2">fact deserves more community based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.370" end="00:05:07.660" style="s2">the way in which we see our our</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.590" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">listenership and our viewership going</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:13.479" style="s2">and so rather than fear that anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:15.520" style="s2">would emerge with leadership because all</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.479" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">of course anything with leadership looks</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:20.530" style="s2">like Hitler too many people anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">that looks at all ritualistic looks like</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.530" end="00:05:24.610" style="s2">a cult I think we&#39;re not going to worry</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.580" style="s2">about those things quite so much so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.610" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">think if I can I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:32.500" style="s2">realize that in fact the audience is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:34.690" style="s2">leading and that I need to do a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.500" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">job of just accepting that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.690" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">of interest in new ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">this is one way of kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:45.010" style="s2">unstuck to try to find the portal out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:46.930" style="s2">the stasis and so if the show is to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.010" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">true to its original mission I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.930" end="00:05:51.970" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to take some risks</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:55.780" style="s2">which might mean drinking songs it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.970" end="00:05:57.970" style="s2">mean ritualistic behavior and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.780" end="00:06:00.190" style="s2">it&#39;ll mean a lot more opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.970" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">interact through live dates the show is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.190" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">going to remain unabashedly a commercial</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.740" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">enterprise because otherwise it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">never happen and I want to give a huge</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:14.760" style="s2">shout out to cast media who has been the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:16.599" style="s2">original studio and effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.760" end="00:06:20.620" style="s2">co-producer of the show along with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.599" end="00:06:22.360" style="s2">Jessie Michaels and the advertisers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.620" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">the sponsors who have been paying for</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.360" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">the equipment for the people who worked</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:28.330" style="s2">on the show so that nobody had to shell</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.330" end="00:06:32.139" style="s2">show would never have happened if it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.770" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">wasn&#39;t taking place as a commercial and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.139" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">a enterprise and so even though some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:37.990" style="s2">you find the ads annoying although</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">others of you find them actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.990" end="00:06:41.860" style="s2">entertaining or interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:43.930" style="s2">what we need to do is to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.860" end="00:06:47.830" style="s2">better model and a model in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.930" end="00:06:50.620" style="s2">sponsors get access to the kind of heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.830" end="00:06:52.390" style="s2">and passion for sticking with the show</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.620" end="00:06:54.430" style="s2">so I think I&#39;m gonna try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.390" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">how the risk for tiser model works in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.430" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">earnest this year but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:00.730" style="s2">important to me that those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:02.470" style="s2">wish to avoid having your brain sullied</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.730" end="00:07:04.570" style="s2">with any kind of commercial intrusion</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.470" end="00:07:05.980" style="s2">have an option to do that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.570" end="00:07:08.890" style="s2">doing that through the YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.980" end="00:07:11.620" style="s2">and in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.890" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">I feel like in general if you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.620" end="00:07:15.820" style="s2">to sit through maybe an initial ad that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.320" style="s2">rolls before the video goes you usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.820" end="00:07:19.300" style="s2">have an uninterrupted viewing or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.320" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">listening experience thereafter we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.300" end="00:07:22.930" style="s2">try to get the videos a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">better sync with the audio but most</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.930" end="00:07:28.540" style="s2">importantly what I want to get to is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:30.280" style="s2">what the show is really about and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.540" end="00:07:33.160" style="s2">last thing I will say on the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.280" end="00:07:35.650" style="s2">initial housekeeping is we probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.160" end="00:07:37.630" style="s2">needed to recognize earlier that we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.650" end="00:07:40.600" style="s2">your help a lot of you guys are audio</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.630" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2">engineers or your graphic designers or</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.600" end="00:07:46.600" style="s2">your website builders I don&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.300" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">how to source the talent we need from</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.600" end="00:07:52.630" style="s2">the pool but I&#39;ve been bombarded by</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:54.310" style="s2">wonderful offers from many of you some</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.630" end="00:07:56.290" style="s2">of you at the absolute top of your field</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.310" end="00:07:58.840" style="s2">who want to help this podcast because</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.290" end="00:08:01.990" style="s2">you want to see this grow as a movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.840" end="00:08:04.830" style="s2">and maybe I was slow to recognize how</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.990" end="00:08:07.300" style="s2">genuine the interest was and just to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.830" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">thank you I mean I think it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.300" end="00:08:11.110" style="s2">sort of hard to recognize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">working for various internal</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.110" end="00:08:15.160" style="s2">psychological reasons I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:18.460" style="s2">incredibly touched and I really want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.160" end="00:08:20.710" style="s2">incorporate some of the offers of help</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.460" end="00:08:22.690" style="s2">because lord knows we need it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.710" end="00:08:23.980" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out how to do it yet so</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.690" end="00:08:27.340" style="s2">stay tuned I think we&#39;ll be organizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.980" end="00:08:30.670" style="s2">that shortly we&#39;ve now got a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.340" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">group for the portal podcast we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.670" end="00:08:35.560" style="s2">an Instagram account that&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:37.660" style="s2">Twitter still our largest following but</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.560" end="00:08:40.270" style="s2">the actual subscriptions to the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.660" end="00:08:43.630" style="s2">on both YouTube through Apple and other</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.270" end="00:08:46.180" style="s2">places are now quite large and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">it&#39;ll be increasingly hard to shut down</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.180" end="00:08:50.830" style="s2">these channels to you so that even if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:53.480" style="s2">lose one or two of them because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.830" end="00:08:55.220" style="s2">something we say hopefully we&#39;ll remain</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.480" end="00:08:57.410" style="s2">engaged and we&#39;ll try to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.220" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re not vulnerable to having the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.410" end="00:09:04.130" style="s2">oxygen cut off all right so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:07.190" style="s2">that is happening in 2020 what kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.130" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">decade are we up for what&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.190" end="00:09:13.190" style="s2">going on with the portal during the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.649" end="00:09:14.570" style="s2">coming year coming ten years I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.190" end="00:09:16.519" style="s2">that the first thing that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.570" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">signal is that we are finally ready to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.519" end="00:09:23.060" style="s2">take on something which I have always</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:26.449" style="s2">found to terrify and that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.060" end="00:09:28.339" style="s2">idea suppression now before we get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.449" end="00:09:31.100" style="s2">idea suppression and how it functions</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.339" end="00:09:33.769" style="s2">and what it is I want to take new</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.100" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">listeners through a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.769" end="00:09:39.709" style="s2">description of how we would order the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:42.350" style="s2">world relative to the portal and its</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.709" end="00:09:45.820" style="s2">objectives so if you will let me take</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.350" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">you back to the end of World War two</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.820" end="00:09:50.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of prehistory but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:53.000" style="s2">afford to do everything so shortly after</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.420" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2">World War Two there were two very</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.000" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">important events in the early 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:09:59.870" style="s2">from our perspective one of which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">the unlocking of the three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.870" end="00:10:07.639" style="s2">structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:13.130" style="s2">1953 and the other was the explosions of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.639" end="00:10:14.899" style="s2">hydrogen devices using work of Edward</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.130" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">Teller and Stanislaw ulam</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.899" end="00:10:21.170" style="s2">and what that changed in the human</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">picture because we went from a short</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.170" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">period where we were dealing with atomic</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">bombs where Duck and Cover was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:30.889" style="s2">plausible solution to dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">hydrogen devices in which the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.889" end="00:10:35.449" style="s2">destructive power was really</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:39.649" style="s2">incalculable it&#39;s the power of gods used</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.449" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">to power the Sun here on earth now for</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.649" end="00:10:43.130" style="s2">my wit to my way of thinking since the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:45.769" style="s2">early 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.130" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">there has been no comparable explosion</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.769" end="00:10:52.220" style="s2">of wisdom to go along with this newfound</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:53.990" style="s2">power that humans have this new godlike</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.220" end="00:10:57.829" style="s2">power so I&#39;ve called this the twin</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.990" end="00:10:59.329" style="s2">nuclei problem of cell and atom and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.829" end="00:11:02.660" style="s2">think what we&#39;ve had is an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.329" end="00:11:05.569" style="s2">run of luck and I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.660" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">magical and marvelous thing but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.569" end="00:11:09.829" style="s2">believe that we can count on</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2">forever and in fact given some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.829" end="00:11:17.050" style="s2">events of early 2020 taking place in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">Iraq and Iran I would say that history</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.050" end="00:11:23.240" style="s2">at the scale that we were accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">it during the let&#39;s say first half of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.240" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">the 20th century could start up at any</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">and we&#39;re entirely unprepared for this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:35.089" style="s2">now in the story that has this major</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.089" end="00:11:41.269" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been following the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.120" end="00:11:44.600" style="s2">that happens that&#39;s really important is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.269" end="00:11:46.610" style="s2">a guy named Eric de sola price starts to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.600" end="00:11:48.740" style="s2">calculate that science is on an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.610" end="00:11:50.810" style="s2">exponential trajectory and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.740" end="00:11:53.180" style="s2">thinking that that&#39;s a great thing he</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.810" end="00:11:55.250" style="s2">starts to understand that anything on an</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.180" end="00:11:57.980" style="s2">exponential trajectory can&#39;t really go</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.250" end="00:12:01.970" style="s2">on because it&#39;s going to burn itself out</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.980" end="00:12:04.339" style="s2">and if science is the original seedcorn</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.970" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">if you will of technology and technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.339" end="00:12:08.899" style="s2">of economics then effectively what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:10.519" style="s2">going to happen in science is going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.899" end="00:12:13.370" style="s2">percolate through a chain through</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.699" end="00:12:23.209" style="s2">started to arrive at these ideas I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:25.550" style="s2">at Yale in the late 1950s it was not</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.209" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">well understood what he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.550" end="00:12:30.860" style="s2">about and still I always shocked that</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.860" end="00:12:35.810" style="s2">wrote and which discusses this issue is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.319" end="00:12:37.699" style="s2">so much less well known than say Thomas</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.630" end="00:22:00.020" style="s2">recommend that you google MSNBC and</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.320" end="00:22:32.180" style="s2">the key question we have is why is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.890" end="00:22:41.060" style="s2">growing I think this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.020" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">topic and what it has to do with is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.060" end="00:22:46.670" style="s2">making maps of silence now through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.980" style="s2">efforts of Dana Boyd and the data and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.670" end="00:22:52.130" style="s2">society group we&#39;ve learned about a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:53.690" style="s2">doctrine called strategic silence and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.130" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">that is that there are certain things</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:22:59.810" style="s2">and therefore rather than simply</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.810" end="00:23:06.730" style="s2">they make editorial decisions so as not</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.190" end="00:23:23.270" style="s2">outside of the political system would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.470" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">treated to something like strategic</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.270" end="00:23:28.520" style="s2">silence or strategic distortion what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:30.710" style="s2">need to do is to have a better</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.940" end="00:23:40.670" style="s2">is special and unique is that he&#39;s given</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.380" end="00:23:53.270" style="s2">very bizarre behavior the second example</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.990" end="00:23:55.730" style="s2">of this that I find fascinating is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.270" end="00:23:57.470" style="s2">death of Jeffrey Epstein now you&#39;ll hear</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.730" end="00:23:59.390" style="s2">a lot of other people say well Epstein</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.470" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">didn&#39;t kill himself or it&#39;s obviously</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.930" end="00:24:51.110" style="s2">fascinating is that if anyone remembers</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.750" end="00:24:56.300" style="s2">the Watergate era the news media used to</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.890" end="00:43:40.359" style="s2">only place that I&#39;m aware of is that it</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.359" end="00:43:46.660" style="s2">because you have Apes carrying on the</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.480" end="00:44:13.540" style="s2">has ever had and this was explored in</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.540" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">mid 1990s by Pia Milani my wife and</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:23.859" style="s2">never got out of Harvard University</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.420" end="00:44:25.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite true there is a book</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.859" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">called the physics of Wall Street by</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.630" end="00:44:29.930" style="s2">James Weatherall which touches upon this</p>

<p begin="00:44:29.930" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">this work died because of something</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:42.290" style="s2">and my wife went into that job market</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.290" end="00:44:46.430" style="s2">presented there thinking that she could</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.900" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">apply anywhere in the country and being</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.430" end="00:44:50.210" style="s2">told instead that she had almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:53.869" style="s2">and that should be lucky to escape with</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.210" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">the PhD now in these three cases that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.869" end="00:44:58.040" style="s2">a theory of death that comes out of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:02.089" style="s2">brother&#39;s work at the University of</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.650" end="00:45:11.900" style="s2">another theory about what is this place</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.940" end="00:45:19.910" style="s2">of geometric unity all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.730" end="00:45:22.069" style="s2">ideas met a level of resistance that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.910" end="00:45:24.140" style="s2">none of us had ever anticipated or</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.069" end="00:45:26.630" style="s2">encountered and I think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.140" end="00:45:28.790" style="s2">terrifying to me to think about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.630" end="00:45:30.770" style="s2">of going up against the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.790" end="00:45:34.430" style="s2">however last year I made an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.770" end="00:45:36.380" style="s2">calculation I decided to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.430" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">presidencies of all of our leading</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.380" end="00:45:41.180" style="s2">research institutions and to try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">figure out how many of them belonged to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.180" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">people who came after the baby boom in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:53.569" style="s2">previous world let&#39;s say the world of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.750" style="s2">the early 1980s approximately half of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.569" end="00:46:01.460" style="s2">the heads of research institutions would</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.750" end="00:46:06.109" style="s2">be Gen X and Gen Y that is Xers and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.460" end="00:46:08.540" style="s2">Millennials however almost no research</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.109" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">university certainly almost no leading</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.540" end="00:46:11.780" style="s2">research university with I think the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:14.059" style="s2">exception of the University of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.780" end="00:46:16.309" style="s2">California at Berkeley when I did this</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.059" end="00:46:18.920" style="s2">calculation last year was under anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.309" end="00:46:21.559" style="s2">other than the presidency of a baby</p>

<p begin="00:46:21.559" end="00:46:25.970" style="s2">rid of a mandatory retirement</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.859" end="00:46:28.730" style="s2">requirement that probably affected</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.970" end="00:46:32.150" style="s2">things fairly significantly and we began</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.730" end="00:46:34.849" style="s2">to concentrate all sorts of power in one</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.150" end="00:46:37.220" style="s2">generations ideas now generations aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.849" end="00:46:40.460" style="s2">magical things what they are are instead</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.220" end="00:46:42.500" style="s2">cohorts that are exposed to some set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.460" end="00:46:44.030" style="s2">circumstances that is peculiar to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.500" end="00:46:46.310" style="s2">time in which they are growing up</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.030" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">so for example if your primary</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.310" end="00:46:51.410" style="s2">experience is that you work hard as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:53.930" style="s2">kid with a paper route and an internship</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.410" end="00:46:55.580" style="s2">you go to college you work your way up a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.930" end="00:46:57.950" style="s2">ladder and everything works out fine and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.580" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">pretty soon before you know it you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.950" end="00:47:04.340" style="s2">got three kids in two homes that&#39;s your</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.340" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">is sort of the basis of the meme okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.740" end="00:47:10.850" style="s2">boomer because many of the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:12.890" style="s2">who followed this generation have no</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.850" end="00:47:16.490" style="s2">idea how you would accomplish that in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.890" end="00:47:18.050" style="s2">these times I actually put the blame</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.490" end="00:47:20.120" style="s2">slightly more in the Silent Generation</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.050" end="00:47:21.710" style="s2">than most people do I think if you look</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.120" end="00:47:24.110" style="s2">at it you realize a lot of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.710" end="00:47:27.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re going that we&#39;re having now</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.490" end="00:47:53.150" style="s2">time to inflict ourselves on our own</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.490" end="00:56:45.480" style="s2">have marked a turning point in</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.190" end="00:56:52.230" style="s2">back a hero I believe in the late 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.559" end="00:56:53.700" style="s2">now Lindbergh was a very difficult human</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.230" end="00:56:56.339" style="s2">being to deal with because he was an</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.700" end="00:56:58.289" style="s2">authentic hero and he was also somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.339" end="00:57:01.019" style="s2">who believed in America first and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.289" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">isolationism and given the Nazi Menace</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.019" end="00:57:08.519" style="s2">in Europe I think that&#39;s almost an</p>

<p begin="00:57:08.519" end="00:57:12.210" style="s2">fact is that Lindbergh commanded to</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.809" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">that since Lindbergh it has been very</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.390" end="00:57:26.250" style="s2">rare to elevate any individual to the</p>
