<p begin="00:00:37.379" end="00:00:41.250" style="s2">p2p foundation and works in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">collaboration with a global group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.250" end="00:00:47.040" style="s2">researchers in the exploration of peer</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">production governance and property cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.040" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">title Michelle what is a vision</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">coordinator well the way we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">organized is that we had five streams of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">activity so one was visioning then we</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">had communication operational forgot the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">two of us well but anyway so each the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">ideas that each of these streams is kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">of you know relatively autonomous and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">we had a little extra budget last year</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:20.729" style="s2">so we divided equally over the five</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">groups and then they kind of decided</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">themselves how to spend it and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">basically what I do is on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of a librarian so I spend quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">a substantial amount of time what I call</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">curating which means you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">happening and so I try to then the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">second step for me is to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">it right so I kind of come into theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">in that sense so how can I make sense in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:51.150" style="s2">an integrated way what&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">largest narrative I can make or what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.150" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">see that gives certain coherence to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing and you know it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">related to that idea of Ken Wilber when</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">he talks about vision logic right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just something that I do naturally</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">organically I&#39;m a big picture person so</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:13.739" style="s2">I like you know macro history I like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">put things together and I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.739" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">librarian for you know almost all my</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:21.959" style="s2">life so putting these two together these</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">two aspects together is a bit second</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.959" end="00:02:25.370" style="s2">nature for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:27.560" style="s2">that sounds like a great job certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.370" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">it certainly beats being a CEO all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.560" end="00:02:32.629" style="s2">I&#39;ve been that a few times that&#39;s a pain</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:35.180" style="s2">in the ass right so let&#39;s start with p2p</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.629" end="00:02:37.790" style="s2">which for our audience stands for peer</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.180" end="00:02:40.609" style="s2">to peer you can find a lot more here at</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.790" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">the p2p Foundation dotnet and as usual</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.609" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll have links to everything we talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:46.579" style="s2">about every organization every book and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:48.919" style="s2">most articles on the episode page at Jim</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.579" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">Rutte show com so feel free to go there</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.919" end="00:02:54.530" style="s2">and get the link to these things so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:56.510" style="s2">let&#39;s start with at the simplest level a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:02:58.669" style="s2">simple syllable description will dig</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.510" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">into considerable detail but what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.669" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">peer to peer what does that mean all</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:05.359" style="s2">right so I&#39;ll first give you a short</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:06.829" style="s2">explanation but I do want to give some</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.359" end="00:03:10.459" style="s2">historical background why this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.829" end="00:03:12.169" style="s2">important so peer to peer was used you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.459" end="00:03:15.049" style="s2">know about 15 years ago I think when</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.169" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">Napster came out and so the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.049" end="00:03:19.909" style="s2">that we could have computer systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:21.769" style="s2">where every computer was autonomous and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.909" end="00:03:23.900" style="s2">could freely communicate with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.769" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">computers without passing through a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:27.470" style="s2">server it&#39;s kind of like the founding</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:30.470" style="s2">principle of the internet if you like</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.470" end="00:03:33.169" style="s2">and it it has changed it&#39;s become more</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.470" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">hierarchical as is these big companies</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.169" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2">took it over but originally the idea you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:41.569" style="s2">know the people who invented the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:44.479" style="s2">internet was to make it a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.569" end="00:03:47.659" style="s2">system now if you take that idea and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.479" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">apply it to people then you have really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.659" end="00:03:53.540" style="s2">the same dynamic so what if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:57.169" style="s2">system where every person could freely</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.540" end="00:03:58.939" style="s2">communicate self-organized and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.169" end="00:04:01.790" style="s2">make projects with any other person</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:04.759" style="s2">freely without any intermediaries or</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:08.209" style="s2">gatekeepers and so that&#39;s the definition</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.759" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">right so any system where any individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.209" end="00:04:14.419" style="s2">can connect organize and even produce</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.949" style="s2">value together on this basis of free</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.419" end="00:04:18.259" style="s2">contribution would be a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.949" end="00:04:21.769" style="s2">system but I want to give you some</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.259" end="00:04:24.110" style="s2">historical idea because for me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.769" end="00:04:27.229" style="s2">kind of anthropological revolution now I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.110" end="00:04:30.020" style="s2">want to explain why that is so when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.229" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">started the human adventure you know in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.020" end="00:04:36.199" style="s2">the Neolithic times most people live in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.680" style="s2">small groups and there is this idea from</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.199" end="00:04:40.699" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.680" end="00:04:43.910" style="s2">apologies called Dunbar that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.699" end="00:04:46.940" style="s2">primates people can remember and trust</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.910" end="00:04:49.490" style="s2">about 150 people so imagine you live in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.940" end="00:04:53.210" style="s2">a tribe in a village you know nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.490" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">group and you know everybody&#39;s skin is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.210" end="00:04:57.889" style="s2">skin with you is family uncles and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:04:59.449" style="s2">know whatever and so whenever there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.889" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">an issue you just you know you go talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.449" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">to them basically so it&#39;s easy to solve</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:08.740" style="s2">problems in a convivial way but as soon</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:11.419" style="s2">as we kind of got scale in your society</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.740" end="00:05:13.340" style="s2">you know and had larger groups that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.419" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t work anymore so we kind of also</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.340" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">had to invent a hierarchy you know in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:22.849" style="s2">terms of streamlining communication and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">transaction costs in in society and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.849" end="00:05:27.800" style="s2">that then creates is a conundrum because</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">people what they love most is to live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.800" end="00:05:33.430" style="s2">family be with friends and have this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:36.979" style="s2">convivial lifestyle but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:40.430" style="s2">exist and compete with other you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.979" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">predatory and competing entities then</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.430" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">the hierarchy will impose very strict</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:48.470" style="s2">limits of what can be done so in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:51.320" style="s2">kind of context and which we know 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.470" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">years of class-based society is behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.320" end="00:05:57.169" style="s2">us the fact that we invented technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2">that allows people to virtually connect</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.169" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">with each other and actually coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:04.039" style="s2">on a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">you know like Linux or Wikipedia right</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.039" end="00:06:11.590" style="s2">so tons of people are collaborating and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:15.380" style="s2">yet the average team level of a Linux</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.590" end="00:06:17.900" style="s2">you know group is four people so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.380" end="00:06:20.330" style="s2">that tells me is that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.900" end="00:06:22.220" style="s2">another form of conviviality which can</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.330" end="00:06:24.740" style="s2">then coexist with our territorial</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.220" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">organization and so that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.740" end="00:06:30.320" style="s2">promise of peer-to-peer is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:33.169" style="s2">we can organize ourselves around common</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.320" end="00:06:36.199" style="s2">projects and because you and I will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.169" end="00:06:37.789" style="s2">contributing out of a free Accord that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.199" end="00:06:39.800" style="s2">means a lot of things in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.789" end="00:06:42.830" style="s2">organization because why should I listen</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:45.139" style="s2">to you tell me what I should do if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.830" end="00:06:48.260" style="s2">both freely contributing to this project</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.139" end="00:06:50.660" style="s2">so we will have to invent other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.260" end="00:06:52.730" style="s2">working together and so that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">other words come from so you have peer</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.730" end="00:06:56.300" style="s2">production the capacity to freely</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">produce together</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.470" end="00:07:08.870" style="s2">the capacity to create you know mutual</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.870" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">can help us work together so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.510" end="00:07:18.140" style="s2">of in a nutshell why I like peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.160" end="00:07:20.780" style="s2">very good we recently had on the show</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.140" end="00:07:23.060" style="s2">rich Bartlett from Inspiral and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.780" end="00:07:24.890" style="s2">talked a lot about the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:26.420" style="s2">aspects of it and for people that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.890" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">interested in that I&#39;d recommend they go</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.420" end="00:07:32.090" style="s2">check out that episode as well closely</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.320" style="s2">related now that you mention it one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.090" end="00:07:34.970" style="s2">things I think is probably useful for</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">our audience and probably for both of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.970" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">to get on the same page is that when</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:41.990" style="s2">people think of peer-to-peer jour</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">naively in the current world they mostly</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.990" end="00:07:47.900" style="s2">think about non rival risks goods things</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:50.030" style="s2">like open-source software or a music</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.900" end="00:07:52.310" style="s2">file back in the Napster days that could</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.030" end="00:07:54.890" style="s2">be copied for a tiny fraction of a said</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.310" end="00:07:57.920" style="s2">but economics can in one cut on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.890" end="00:08:01.160" style="s2">world of goods is into rival RIS and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.920" end="00:08:03.710" style="s2">nonrival wrists my favorite example for</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.160" end="00:08:05.900" style="s2">rival wrists is a ham sandwich either</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.710" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">you eat it or I eat it we can&#39;t both eat</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.900" end="00:08:09.320" style="s2">it right we could cut it down the middle</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s essentially a non rival or as</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.320" end="00:08:13.490" style="s2">good once it&#39;s been eaten whoever ate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.720" end="00:08:16.130" style="s2">has done the job on the other hand and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.490" end="00:08:18.740" style="s2">nonrival risk good is a good that can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.130" end="00:08:21.200" style="s2">reproduced very inexpensively like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.740" end="00:08:22.970" style="s2">music file or most medicines actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.200" end="00:08:24.590" style="s2">are very inexpensive to make so that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.970" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">it weren&#39;t entangled with intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.590" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">property constraints there would be no</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:29.660" style="s2">reason that everyone who wanted it could</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:31.640" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.660" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">there&#39;s third class so-called public</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.640" end="00:08:36.620" style="s2">goods you know for instance law and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:38.419" style="s2">order as a public good we all take part</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.620" end="00:08:41.150" style="s2">in it for both good and evil as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.419" end="00:08:44.330" style="s2">turning out I suspect but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.150" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">exchange and more traditional economics</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.330" end="00:08:49.340" style="s2">rival risks and nonrival risks are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:51.350" style="s2">important divisions can you speak a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.340" end="00:08:53.990" style="s2">little bit to the applicability of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.350" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">peer-to-peer idea in the rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.990" end="00:08:57.850" style="s2">domain in particular where I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:01.400" style="s2">people are less used to hearing about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.850" end="00:09:04.130" style="s2">yes so I actually want to tell you first</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.400" end="00:09:04.579" style="s2">that peer-to-peer can be used in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.130" end="00:09:06.619" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.579" end="00:09:08.179" style="s2">exchange and some people would argue</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.619" end="00:09:10.309" style="s2">that the market is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.179" end="00:09:13.189" style="s2">peer-to-peer system because you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.309" end="00:09:15.679" style="s2">peers can exchange and now of course we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.189" end="00:09:19.579" style="s2">have these platforms that are privately</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.679" end="00:09:21.499" style="s2">owned but where people can exchange like</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.579" end="00:09:24.279" style="s2">supply and demand can meet each other on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.499" end="00:09:27.259" style="s2">a platform the kind of peer-to-peer I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.279" end="00:09:29.119" style="s2">use is more in the sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.259" end="00:09:31.339" style="s2">question so it&#39;s using these</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.119" end="00:09:36.079" style="s2">peer-to-peer dynamics to create Commons</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.339" end="00:09:38.029" style="s2">and actually I&#39;m going to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.079" end="00:09:40.429" style="s2">disagree with you because the the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.029" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">Commons and a commons is defined within</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.429" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">three ways so it&#39;s a shared resource</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:48.549" style="s2">that is produced or maintained by a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:52.309" style="s2">community or a group of stakeholders and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.549" end="00:09:54.470" style="s2">that is self regulated so these so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.309" end="00:09:57.110" style="s2">a resource it&#39;s a group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.470" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a form of governance and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.110" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">Elinor Ostrom who kind of was the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.170" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">to really study the Commons defined it</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.660" end="00:10:07.069" style="s2">broadly and if you look at the history</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:10.730" style="s2">of the Commons the first comments were</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.069" end="00:10:13.999" style="s2">actually you know physical resources so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.730" end="00:10:16.850" style="s2">if you look at forests and river basins</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.999" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">and fishing communities you know before</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.850" end="00:10:23.540" style="s2">we had a capitalist system most of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:26.600" style="s2">resources where it comes so for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.540" end="00:10:29.179" style="s2">if you travel in Japan or Austria and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.600" end="00:10:31.309" style="s2">Switzerland and you ask yourself why is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.179" end="00:10:33.439" style="s2">everything so green you know in the in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.309" end="00:10:35.480" style="s2">the mountain flanks of these countries</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.439" end="00:10:37.069" style="s2">is because they are Commons in other</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.480" end="00:10:39.019" style="s2">words the villages themselves are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.069" end="00:10:41.509" style="s2">ones that manage the use of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.019" end="00:10:44.239" style="s2">resource and they do so with a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.509" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">perspective so because they all depend</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.239" end="00:10:48.889" style="s2">on it they will manage it collectively</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:51.860" style="s2">in a way that you know seven generations</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.889" end="00:10:53.989" style="s2">can can still use it so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.860" end="00:10:55.939" style="s2">phase of the Commons and I want to give</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.989" end="00:10:58.759" style="s2">you a historical example you know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.939" end="00:11:01.850" style="s2">most important Catholic ritual in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.759" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">medieval Europe next to Christmas and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.850" end="00:11:07.189" style="s2">Easter was called the Rogan tied</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:09.499" style="s2">procession and this was when the all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.189" end="00:11:13.039" style="s2">people of the parish would collectively</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.499" end="00:11:15.860" style="s2">you know circumvent it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.039" end="00:11:18.410" style="s2">perambulation I think in English city</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.860" end="00:11:20.360" style="s2">would go around the parish and come</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.410" end="00:11:22.550" style="s2">their comments they would say this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.360" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">from all of us so this is important but</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.550" end="00:11:27.769" style="s2">it means that in the Middle Ages if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:29.810" style="s2">were a farmer in a parish your identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.769" end="00:11:31.970" style="s2">was actually constituted by your</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.810" end="00:11:33.259" style="s2">collaboration in these comments so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.970" end="00:11:35.269" style="s2">here&#39;s of course on the one hand you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.259" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">feudal system you so you had a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.269" end="00:11:38.899" style="s2">land on your own you had the land of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.680" end="00:11:40.819" style="s2">Lord which you you know you worked and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.899" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">gave part of it to the Lord in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.819" end="00:11:44.810" style="s2">exchange for protection but you also had</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:47.500" style="s2">these common resources that you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.810" end="00:11:49.850" style="s2">use so that&#39;s the first phase and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">capitalism whatever you think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.850" end="00:11:54.709" style="s2">system is really based on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:56.680" style="s2">destruction of the Commons so this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.709" end="00:12:00.439" style="s2">called the enclosures right it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.680" end="00:12:01.879" style="s2">people started fencing in and what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.439" end="00:12:05.240" style="s2">have to remember that the originally</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.879" end="00:12:07.730" style="s2">property was not absolute individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.240" end="00:12:09.019" style="s2">property but in this context it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.730" end="00:12:12.319" style="s2">something that belonged to your family</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.019" end="00:12:15.199" style="s2">and as the head as a patriarch you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.319" end="00:12:16.699" style="s2">of your family lineage you couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.199" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">what you want with the property you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.699" end="00:12:20.839" style="s2">to protect it for all the descendants</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:24.139" style="s2">that would come after you but once you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.839" end="00:12:27.110" style="s2">have property that you can sell whenever</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.139" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">you want that&#39;s when the enclosure</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.110" end="00:12:31.220" style="s2">started because what people then found</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:33.100" style="s2">was that was that they could make more</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.220" end="00:12:35.959" style="s2">profit with sheep done with people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.100" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">the enclosures is this whole process of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.959" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">fencing the common property and making</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">into private property so the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.720" end="00:12:47.149" style="s2">phase of the Commons was social Commons</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">so all these farmers expelled from their</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.149" end="00:12:51.889" style="s2">farm they become workers in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">early manufacturing cities like in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.889" end="00:12:56.449" style="s2">England in 19th century they have no</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">protection whatsoever they die when</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.449" end="00:13:02.149" style="s2">they&#39;re 30 on average and so they create</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:04.370" style="s2">the mutualization of their life risk and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.149" end="00:13:06.589" style="s2">this is what gave us the welfare system</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.370" end="00:13:08.089" style="s2">you know like the New Deal type of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.589" end="00:13:09.980" style="s2">organizations that you have in the US</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.089" end="00:13:12.500" style="s2">you know they weren&#39;t invented by</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.980" end="00:13:14.180" style="s2">Roosevelt he looked at what the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.500" end="00:13:17.660" style="s2">already doing and then decided to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.180" end="00:13:20.149" style="s2">generalize and beverage in the UK they</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.660" end="00:13:22.309" style="s2">did the same so this is the second phase</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.149" end="00:13:24.170" style="s2">when the social Commons became dominant</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.309" end="00:13:27.350" style="s2">because the physical resources had been</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.170" end="00:13:29.809" style="s2">privatized and the welfare state is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.350" end="00:13:32.300" style="s2">nationalization if you like of these</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">with me then I I am because then I go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.430" end="00:13:38.330" style="s2">the third phase which is you know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:40.790" style="s2">we know in our generations which is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.330" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">digital Commons and so the Internet&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.790" end="00:13:45.800" style="s2">kind of showed people who are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">familiar with what Commons were that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">while we can work together we can create</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.170" end="00:13:54.230" style="s2">a Wikipedia a free software open design</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:56.960" style="s2">so culture II that was very important to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.230" end="00:13:59.780" style="s2">for people to realize that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.960" end="00:14:02.120" style="s2">easy to work together but we didn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.780" end="00:14:05.630" style="s2">there Jim because the fourth phase which</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.120" end="00:14:07.790" style="s2">I studied in Ghent in 2017 in the north</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.630" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">of Belgium is the urban Commons and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.790" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">know they have increased tenfold from</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:18.200" style="s2">roughly 2006 to 2016 you can take any</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">city in the West with even in Latin</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.200" end="00:14:24.440" style="s2">America and you&#39;ll see studies that show</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:26.300" style="s2">an enormous exponential rise of urban</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.440" end="00:14:28.220" style="s2">Commons so that means that people for</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.300" end="00:14:31.310" style="s2">example if you want organic food are</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.220" end="00:14:34.010" style="s2">going to create CSAs right consumer</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.310" end="00:14:37.580" style="s2">supported agriculture community land</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.010" end="00:14:39.770" style="s2">Trust&#39;s energy co-ops so we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.580" end="00:14:42.080" style="s2">going back to material comments because</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.770" end="00:14:44.630" style="s2">in many cases there is either market</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.080" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2">failure or state failure and people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.630" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">are motivated will say okay why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:51.620" style="s2">do it together through our resources to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.840" style="s2">make sure that we all can eat organic</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.620" end="00:14:56.330" style="s2">food and I would say and this is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.840" end="00:14:59.230" style="s2">concluding the the phase that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.330" end="00:15:02.090" style="s2">is what I call Cosmo local production is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.230" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">that think about permaculture right</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.090" end="00:15:07.700" style="s2">there&#39;s thousands and thousands of plots</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:09.560" style="s2">nowadays so they&#39;re very local but all</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.700" end="00:15:12.410" style="s2">the people do permaculture learn from</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.560" end="00:15:16.250" style="s2">each other in their network where they</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.410" end="00:15:19.160" style="s2">pull the knowledge together and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.250" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">have for example in Europe 120 what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.160" end="00:15:26.570" style="s2">call multi factories where craftspeople</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:29.570" style="s2">you know look for like if an old factory</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.570" end="00:15:33.010" style="s2">they can use they mutual eyes the space</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.570" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">so each crafts person has his own space</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.010" end="00:15:37.700" style="s2">but they they banished it together they</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.960" end="00:15:39.950" style="s2">use open-source principles and all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.700" end="00:15:42.050" style="s2">them working together work for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.950" end="00:15:43.880" style="s2">invisible Factory that&#39;s how they call</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.050" end="00:15:45.889" style="s2">it and this is everything they do</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.880" end="00:15:48.410" style="s2">together and pull together</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.889" end="00:15:50.899" style="s2">so there you can see that a Commons is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.410" end="00:15:53.869" style="s2">very much also potentially related to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.899" end="00:15:56.449" style="s2">the market and I would argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.869" end="00:15:58.239" style="s2">medieval markets in the you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.449" end="00:16:00.980" style="s2">three European cities of the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.239" end="00:16:03.439" style="s2">where markets that were working with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.980" end="00:16:06.889" style="s2">gills which were Commons so they created</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.439" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">these ethical economies that would</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.889" end="00:16:12.619" style="s2">protect the worker guilds you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:14.779" style="s2">against and divide the power with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.619" end="00:16:16.879" style="s2">church and the law and the feudal lords</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.779" end="00:16:19.790" style="s2">and the kings and they succeeded this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.879" end="00:16:21.529" style="s2">for you know a few centuries yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.790" end="00:16:23.089" style="s2">good in fact yeah when I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.529" end="00:16:25.129" style="s2">what we think of when we think of peer</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.089" end="00:16:26.809" style="s2">to peer these days tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.129" end="00:16:28.999" style="s2">electronic and Internet you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.809" end="00:16:30.499" style="s2">absolutely right the real history of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.999" end="00:16:32.660" style="s2">goes all the way back to the dawn of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.499" end="00:16:34.910" style="s2">time when all of our production was</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.660" end="00:16:36.769" style="s2">essentially peer-to-peer yet the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.910" end="00:16:38.869" style="s2">difference is only that now because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.769" end="00:16:41.259" style="s2">have virtual tools we can create virtual</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.869" end="00:16:44.540" style="s2">territories on top of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.259" end="00:16:48.319" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the big revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.540" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">it existed that it was bounded you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.319" end="00:16:53.749" style="s2">in time and space to you know smaller</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:56.089" style="s2">communities and what we&#39;ve achieved with</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.749" end="00:16:59.389" style="s2">the internet is the potential to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.089" end="00:17:02.629" style="s2">global projects that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.389" end="00:17:03.529" style="s2">coordinated to these comments yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.629" end="00:17:05.899" style="s2">going to talk about that a little later</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.529" end="00:17:08.209" style="s2">I just add a little personal note which</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.899" end="00:17:11.480" style="s2">I do from time to time I happen to live</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.209" end="00:17:14.779" style="s2">in a county in the United States which</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.480" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">does not have the fence in law for</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.779" end="00:17:19.880" style="s2">property that&#39;s one of the few in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">United States that still offense out law</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.880" end="00:17:25.100" style="s2">essentially so in principle the common</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">still exists and there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.100" end="00:17:29.059" style="s2">mountains fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">government-owned land that in principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.059" end="00:17:34.130" style="s2">you can put your hogs out in the fall</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:36.980" style="s2">and run on the common land and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.130" end="00:17:39.230" style="s2">legal sort of that&#39;s interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.980" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">and the law literally is still that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.230" end="00:17:43.669" style="s2">your duty to fence animals out if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">what you want to do not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.669" end="00:17:47.630" style="s2">understands that which produce some hurt</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.580" style="s2">feelings particularly from newcomers who</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.630" end="00:17:52.700" style="s2">don&#39;t understand this older tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.580" end="00:17:54.409" style="s2">but within US law it is legal at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.700" end="00:17:56.870" style="s2">in the state of Virginia for a county to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.409" end="00:17:59.059" style="s2">choose to be a fence out County rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:17:59.750" style="s2">than fence in I think there&#39;s three or</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.059" end="00:18:03.230" style="s2">something out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.750" end="00:18:05.000" style="s2">125 I&#39;m Justin ated I want to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.230" end="00:18:07.130" style="s2">about this I didn&#39;t know this this is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.000" end="00:18:10.280" style="s2">interesting because just this week I saw</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.130" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">several things passing by about common</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.280" end="00:18:14.810" style="s2">land pastures in Europe and I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:17.390" style="s2">actually you know surprised that so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.810" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">of it is still existing so for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.390" end="00:18:22.580" style="s2">in Galicia which is one of the Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">provinces one-third of the land is still</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.580" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">common land and in France and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:31.430" style="s2">expect it at all there&#39;s 100,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:34.730" style="s2">in an association of you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.430" end="00:18:38.120" style="s2">communal Commons so these are like in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.730" end="00:18:39.710" style="s2">the Alps and the Piron a region&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.120" end="00:18:41.780" style="s2">River Management common forest</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.710" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">management so they do still exist even</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.780" end="00:18:45.620" style="s2">though they kind of disappeared from</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:47.720" style="s2">from consciousness of you know most city</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.620" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">dwellers and everything yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">we should definitely catwalk those for</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">people to learn about ok let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:56.210" style="s2">here a little bit one thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:58.550" style="s2">reference is that a fair amount of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.210" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">follows not all of it I dug out of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.550" end="00:19:02.120" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:05.810" style="s2">Michelle wrote with the source Costas</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.120" end="00:19:08.570" style="s2">and Alex Positas called peer to peer the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.810" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">Commons manifesto if you want to dig in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.570" end="00:19:12.470" style="s2">a little bit deeper than we&#39;re going in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:14.270" style="s2">the show grab that book it&#39;s available I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.470" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">got my copy on Amazon I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.270" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">available for free from the p2p</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.710" end="00:19:29.210" style="s2">very good all right talking about</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.210" end="00:19:33.170" style="s2">very nice little swing to my next topic</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.400" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">one of the things you have on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.170" end="00:19:37.430" style="s2">website is that part of what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">peer-to-peer and and and creating a</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:56.750" style="s2">be used to exploit the process for</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.750" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">thoughts on that yeah I&#39;m a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.390" end="00:20:05.660" style="s2">heretic in that sense because so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:08.090" style="s2">basically today you have the choice</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.660" end="00:20:11.510" style="s2">between kind of two extremes which is</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.010" end="00:20:15.030" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.260" end="00:20:17.010" style="s2">you need my permission you to pay me and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.030" end="00:20:20.340" style="s2">then copyleft exact opposite is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.010" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">everybody can use it but my view is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.340" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">if you want to create you know better</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:28.950" style="s2">ethical and generative markets</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:30.900" style="s2">non-predatory markets is that you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.950" end="00:20:32.610" style="s2">some defense mechanism and that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.900" end="00:20:35.970" style="s2">the book I propose something called copy</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:37.680" style="s2">fair which kind of sits in between so</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.970" end="00:20:40.020" style="s2">what is copy fair is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.680" end="00:20:41.430" style="s2">around these productive communities</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.020" end="00:20:43.860" style="s2">which which are open collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.430" end="00:20:45.390" style="s2">systems where everybody can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:47.670" style="s2">to Linux and and about the new</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.390" end="00:20:50.430" style="s2">blockchain systems at the same principle</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.670" end="00:20:52.920" style="s2">but if you want to create an economy</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.430" end="00:20:55.740" style="s2">which is not controlled by you know big</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.920" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">multinational corporations you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.740" end="00:21:02.280" style="s2">protect the the ethical firms and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:04.560" style="s2">copy fair is the principle that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.280" end="00:21:07.650" style="s2">knowledge can be shared as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.560" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">like but if you want to make money then</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.650" end="00:21:11.220" style="s2">you need to show some form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.850" end="00:21:14.610" style="s2">reciprocity with the community who has</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.220" end="00:21:16.560" style="s2">produced that knowledge and so on an</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.610" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">example of a group that does that is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.560" end="00:21:21.080" style="s2">fair shares association which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:24.660" style="s2">actually a property format in the UK and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:27.030" style="s2">so what they do is everybody can use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.660" end="00:21:30.210" style="s2">word they produce with a Creative</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.030" end="00:21:32.550" style="s2">Commons non-commercial license which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.210" end="00:21:35.970" style="s2">like a restriction but if you pay the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.550" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">membership fee and so you reciprocate in</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.970" end="00:21:39.900" style="s2">the production of that knowledge then</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:42.860" style="s2">you have the Creative Commons license</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.900" end="00:21:45.420" style="s2">which also allows commercial use right I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.860" end="00:21:46.980" style="s2">think that this is interesting and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.420" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">I am and I&#39;m seeking some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.980" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">convergence between you know the co-op&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.910" style="s2">model destroy the earth economic models</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:56.790" style="s2">the big corporations the social</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.790" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">and if they would use these licenses</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.640" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">they could then you know create these</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:06.300" style="s2">kind of ethical generative</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:08.870" style="s2">entrepreneurial coalition&#39;s which I call</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.300" end="00:22:11.010" style="s2">and trade Ontario because</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.870" end="00:22:14.010" style="s2">entrepreneurial actually means a team</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.010" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">illogically taking in between and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.010" end="00:22:17.730" style="s2">would like to see you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:20.390" style="s2">markets that we had in medieval cities</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.730" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">which which in narrative markets with</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.390" end="00:22:26.040" style="s2">issues like just pricing where you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:27.250" style="s2">there is this consciousness also in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.040" end="00:22:30.160" style="s2">market players</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.250" end="00:22:31.780" style="s2">that they&#39;re there to serve society yep</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.160" end="00:22:33.880" style="s2">that sounds very good and you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.780" end="00:22:36.280" style="s2">been engaged with these licensing</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.880" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">standards for many years and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.280" end="00:22:40.600" style="s2">with you that you know the current</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:42.820" style="s2">models GPL is just strange and weird not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.600" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">really practical for a lot of real-world</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.820" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">projects and yet on the other hand side</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">copyright is not what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">looking for for trying to build a world</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:54.160" style="s2">around sharing I&#39;m glad to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:56.250" style="s2">you know new hybrid forms that have some</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.160" end="00:22:58.330" style="s2">more critical thinking about real world</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.250" end="00:23:00.010" style="s2">applications and then like I have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.330" end="00:23:02.140" style="s2">check out fair shares that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.010" end="00:23:04.210" style="s2">interesting I tend to normally recommend</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.140" end="00:23:06.370" style="s2">people look at the MIT licenses they</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.210" end="00:23:08.770" style="s2">give you a lot of room to pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.370" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">dial in what you want and they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.770" end="00:23:12.670" style="s2">prescriptive than things like GPL it</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">might be that I don&#39;t know find out</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.670" end="00:23:16.390" style="s2">maybe fair share just built on top of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.760" style="s2">the MIT licensing scheme but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.390" end="00:23:21.010" style="s2">important and when people are gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.760" end="00:23:23.410" style="s2">project particularly in the non rival</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.010" end="00:23:25.690" style="s2">wrist world I always tell them think</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.410" end="00:23:28.120" style="s2">long and hard before you choose your</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.690" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">license because the license actually can</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.120" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">empower or can constrain what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:35.950" style="s2">trying to do yeah you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.190" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">paradox right I mean if you define the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.950" end="00:23:39.790" style="s2">word communism like Marx did which means</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:43.300" style="s2">everybody contributes what he wants and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.790" end="00:23:45.190" style="s2">uses what he needs that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.300" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">official definition in the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.190" end="00:23:50.410" style="s2">but you know before the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:52.210" style="s2">Soviet systems changed the meaning if</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.410" end="00:23:56.140" style="s2">you use that definition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.210" end="00:23:59.020" style="s2">paradoxically you know the GPL is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.140" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">kind of license but then the paradox is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.020" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">that it also allows big companies to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">that knowledge and so what you get then</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:08.710" style="s2">is these open-source economies that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:11.560" style="s2">totally dominated by a big companies now</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.710" end="00:24:13.680" style="s2">it works for free software but what if</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.560" end="00:24:17.110" style="s2">you start making these eyes for machines</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.680" end="00:24:19.030" style="s2">right then you&#39;re really worried that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.110" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">some big company will just take a design</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.030" end="00:24:23.920" style="s2">and mass-produce that machine and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:25.990" style="s2">will out-compete you in a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.920" end="00:24:29.620" style="s2">months and you&#39;ll be dead you see what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:31.780" style="s2">mean yep absolutely so in those cases</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.620" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">like for coops and singer I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.780" end="00:24:35.740" style="s2">idea of copy fair would really serve</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">their needs because then they could</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.740" end="00:24:40.870" style="s2">share the knowledge but be secure that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.500" end="00:24:42.670" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t be used by</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.870" end="00:24:45.280" style="s2">bad actors that just take the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.670" end="00:24:48.580" style="s2">and then you know destroy them in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.280" end="00:24:50.200" style="s2">process so that&#39;s the kind of basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.580" end="00:24:52.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a principle is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.200" end="00:24:55.300" style="s2">that yes knowledge can be shared but if</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.930" end="00:24:57.640" style="s2">you make money you should you know share</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.300" end="00:25:00.220" style="s2">a bit of it with all the people that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.640" end="00:25:02.620" style="s2">have co-created that knowledge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.220" end="00:25:05.170" style="s2">also the idea by the way I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.620" end="00:25:07.540" style="s2">you see that in my book but what we call</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.170" end="00:25:09.450" style="s2">contributing accounting so I did a study</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.540" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">with a p2p Foundation and other</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.450" end="00:25:17.260" style="s2">organizations in it was even before 2016</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:19.690" style="s2">we had so we looked at 300 but we call</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.260" end="00:25:21.730" style="s2">peer production communities and we found</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.690" end="00:25:22.890" style="s2">that 75 percent of them so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.730" end="00:25:25.559" style="s2">pretty high number were either</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.890" end="00:25:28.390" style="s2">experimenting or already using</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.559" end="00:25:30.570" style="s2">contribute if accounting so what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.390" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">means is if you have a commons community</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.570" end="00:25:35.020" style="s2">you know you have all kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:37.500" style="s2">contributing but only if you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.020" end="00:25:40.270" style="s2">actually able then to make money with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.500" end="00:25:42.580" style="s2">and so it creates a question of equity</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.270" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">and fairness and so the idea then is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.580" end="00:25:48.040" style="s2">that you create is the second form of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">accounting internally and so the money</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.040" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">comes in from the outside you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:54.750" style="s2">membrane in between and inside it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">redistributed in a different fashion</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.750" end="00:26:00.309" style="s2">right and for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:02.500" style="s2">interested or your listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.309" end="00:26:04.809" style="s2">interested they can look at the open</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.500" end="00:26:06.790" style="s2">value system of cents Orica immemorial</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.809" end="00:26:09.240" style="s2">which has been working for years on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.790" end="00:26:11.559" style="s2">quite sophisticated system of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:13.710" style="s2">contributing accounting so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.559" end="00:26:17.559" style="s2">basically declaring that your community</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.710" end="00:26:21.100" style="s2">you know can choose what is valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.559" end="00:26:23.470" style="s2">your community and then especially now</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.100" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">that you have these intelligent you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.470" end="00:26:28.540" style="s2">crypto monies you can actually design a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">currency that reflects the value of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.540" end="00:26:32.830" style="s2">community and so you have on the one</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:36.010" style="s2">hand the cold currency if you like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.830" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">extractive currency and you can also</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.010" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">have your warm currency that represents</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:44.860" style="s2">this kind of broader recognition of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:45.970" style="s2">collective value a very good point and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.860" end="00:26:47.559" style="s2">you know I like to point out to people</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.970" end="00:26:49.450" style="s2">at least in the United States where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.559" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">very familiar with the internals of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.450" end="00:26:53.350" style="s2">corporate law you can actually do those</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:54.279" style="s2">kinds of things within an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.350" end="00:26:57.399" style="s2">corporate</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.279" end="00:26:59.259" style="s2">or LLC that&#39;s the one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.399" end="00:27:02.289" style="s2">and odd things about English and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.259" end="00:27:04.599" style="s2">american-style law is that you can put</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.289" end="00:27:07.559" style="s2">almost whatever you want in the bylaws</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.599" end="00:27:09.789" style="s2">of a corporation as radical and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.559" end="00:27:12.609" style="s2">cooperative and a communitarian and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.789" end="00:27:14.499" style="s2">peer-to-peer as you want and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.609" end="00:27:15.729" style="s2">really frankly a matter of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.499" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to go through the B</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.729" end="00:27:20.109" style="s2">court process so that has some benefits</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.190" end="00:27:22.149" style="s2">has no real legal significance it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.109" end="00:27:25.659" style="s2">basically takes the fact that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.149" end="00:27:27.159" style="s2">this within the idea of law as code and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.659" end="00:27:29.049" style="s2">create what we want</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.159" end="00:27:30.099" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an interesting example of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.049" end="00:27:31.929" style="s2">something that we did that actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.099" end="00:27:33.999" style="s2">touches back on something Michele spoke</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.929" end="00:27:36.609" style="s2">about earlier the group of us started a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.999" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">makerspace in the small city that I live</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.609" end="00:27:41.769" style="s2">about an hour outside of and we ran it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:43.509" style="s2">nominally as a not-for-profit for about</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.769" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">two years but with the intent that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.509" end="00:27:47.129" style="s2">would never be profitable and we would</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:48.999" style="s2">plow the profits back into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.129" end="00:27:50.529" style="s2">organization but it eventually got big</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.999" end="00:27:52.289" style="s2">enough that we said well let&#39;s make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.529" end="00:27:55.029" style="s2">clear that this will be a not-for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.289" end="00:27:56.710" style="s2">forever so we we decided to go through</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.029" end="00:28:00.009" style="s2">the paperwork of converting it to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.710" end="00:28:03.669" style="s2">United States style not-for-profit and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.009" end="00:28:05.169" style="s2">get the tax authorities the IRS 401 C 3</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.669" end="00:28:08.259" style="s2">designation so it could receive</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.169" end="00:28:10.929" style="s2">tax-deductible gifts etc and then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.259" end="00:28:12.639" style="s2">said how do we want it governed and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.929" end="00:28:13.779" style="s2">jammed on it for awhile and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.639" end="00:28:16.509" style="s2">people who jammed on it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.779" end="00:28:19.259" style="s2">creative young woman who&#39;s an anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.509" end="00:28:22.570" style="s2">and another one who is a medievalist and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.259" end="00:28:24.489" style="s2">I who had some sympathy for both of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.570" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2">those but also knew a lot about you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.489" end="00:28:28.419" style="s2">how to craft corporate organizational</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.409" end="00:28:31.269" style="s2">forms and so we created what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.419" end="00:28:33.609" style="s2">Council of guilds means of governance</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.269" end="00:28:35.109" style="s2">and it&#39;s legal it&#39;s in our bylaws it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.609" end="00:28:38.289" style="s2">approved by the state of Virginia and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.109" end="00:28:40.419" style="s2">was approved by the US I RS as a legal</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.289" end="00:28:43.059" style="s2">means to govern an entity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.419" end="00:28:45.759" style="s2">essentially each of the skill areas at</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.059" end="00:28:49.089" style="s2">our makerspace we have a very extensive</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.759" end="00:28:51.940" style="s2">woodshop we have a pottery shop we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.089" end="00:28:54.489" style="s2">laser cutters we have a bunch of 3d</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.940" end="00:28:56.440" style="s2">printers we have digital Arts Center</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.489" end="00:28:59.259" style="s2">each of those areas can organize itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:29:01.450" style="s2">as a guild and they basically put one</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.259" end="00:29:03.429" style="s2">person on the council of guilds which</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.450" end="00:29:05.470" style="s2">from a legal perspective acts very much</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.429" end="00:29:07.029" style="s2">like a board of directors would in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.470" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">normal corporation and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.029" end="00:29:11.799" style="s2">mechanism for new</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:14.230" style="s2">to be proposed and approved and such and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.799" end="00:29:16.809" style="s2">the Guild&#39;s are self-managing internally</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.230" end="00:29:19.779" style="s2">within themselves people say how did you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.809" end="00:29:22.120" style="s2">do that I said easy it&#39;s just law as</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.779" end="00:29:23.710" style="s2">code so one thing I would encourage</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.120" end="00:29:25.240" style="s2">people who are thinking about doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.710" end="00:29:26.950" style="s2">these things at least in the Anglo</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.240" end="00:29:29.890" style="s2">sphere where we have the English common</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.950" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">law is to realize that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.890" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">very cool ideas can be done within the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:37.240" style="s2">old structures if you allow yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:40.090" style="s2">blank piece of paper to design from I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.240" end="00:29:41.980" style="s2">I&#39;m amazed that chip because I I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.090" end="00:29:44.830" style="s2">know that and I I&#39;d like to make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.980" end="00:29:48.039" style="s2">little remark because so you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.830" end="00:29:50.289" style="s2">bit of a historical dynamic that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.039" end="00:29:53.139" style="s2">that was rushkoff also sometimes speaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.289" end="00:29:55.269" style="s2">about this so basically you know once</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.139" end="00:29:57.970" style="s2">you have kind of class society and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.269" end="00:30:01.210" style="s2">and warfare and everything what an</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.970" end="00:30:05.049" style="s2">empire does is it creates peace within</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.210" end="00:30:06.820" style="s2">and war outside right it conquers and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.049" end="00:30:08.440" style="s2">fights on the outside but in principle</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.820" end="00:30:12.700" style="s2">you know you have like the Pax Romana</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.440" end="00:30:14.380" style="s2">inside so the Middle Ages was a period</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.700" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">of time in Europe where there was no</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.380" end="00:30:20.049" style="s2">central authority or very weak central</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.260" end="00:30:22.630" style="s2">authority so this was a very distributed</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.049" end="00:30:24.130" style="s2">system with no clear power and you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.630" end="00:30:26.649" style="s2">you know here the church and the local</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.130" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">Lords and and then the cities came up</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.649" end="00:30:31.059" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">period because it shows you how a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.059" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">distributive society can work you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.580" end="00:30:40.419" style="s2">with competing power centers and and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:42.340" style="s2">that&#39;s how the free medieval cities were</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.419" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">created when you know the the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.340" end="00:30:47.710" style="s2">started leaving the countryside became</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.740" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">workers skilled workers and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.710" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">created these Solidarity mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:54.100" style="s2">within the city and then also economic</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:56.529" style="s2">ideas that were you know described in at</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.100" end="00:30:59.080" style="s2">12 and 13th century but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.529" end="00:31:01.960" style="s2">that because the you know the elites</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.080" end="00:31:04.659" style="s2">were always nostalgic of the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.960" end="00:31:06.639" style="s2">Empire so when in the 16th century</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.659" end="00:31:09.880" style="s2">you know everybody want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.639" end="00:31:12.850" style="s2">centralization right but now we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.880" end="00:31:14.889" style="s2">exactly again in a period of time where</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.850" end="00:31:17.230" style="s2">centralization is getting a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.889" end="00:31:20.409" style="s2">reputation where we are kind of D</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.230" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">globalizing and so looking at the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.409" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">Ages becomes interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:27.779" style="s2">as a historical example of how things</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.990" end="00:31:29.700" style="s2">can work in a distributed society so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.779" end="00:31:31.320" style="s2">fascinated by the fact that you do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.700" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">and even call it kills because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.320" end="00:31:35.070" style="s2">talking to some friends about this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.830" style="s2">you know it&#39;s one of my ideas was we</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.070" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">have to look at how guilds worked not to</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.830" end="00:31:42.779" style="s2">copy it you know point by point but that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:45.539" style="s2">is inspire us by you know prior</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.779" end="00:31:47.580" style="s2">experience of people yeah that was our</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.539" end="00:31:49.049" style="s2">thinking yeah I would love to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.580" end="00:31:51.510" style="s2">material on what you&#39;re doing there this</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.049" end="00:31:52.950" style="s2">is really interesting to me yet we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.510" end="00:31:54.899" style="s2">it and I&#39;ll send you the link I will</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.950" end="00:31:57.330" style="s2">post it on the episode page where we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.899" end="00:31:59.250" style="s2">actually actually send you the actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.330" end="00:32:02.100" style="s2">legal document that we created to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.250" end="00:32:03.750" style="s2">instantiate our makerspace as a council</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.100" end="00:32:05.580" style="s2">of guilds that it goes into quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.750" end="00:32:06.990" style="s2">of detail and the thing was it pass</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.580" end="00:32:08.940" style="s2">legal muster at both the state and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.990" end="00:32:11.429" style="s2">federal levels so it&#39;s something people</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.940" end="00:32:12.809" style="s2">can feel free to take and use we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.429" end="00:32:14.669" style="s2">decided that as far as we&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.809" end="00:32:16.440" style="s2">that intellectual work we did which was</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.669" end="00:32:19.260" style="s2">quite a bit is in the Commons and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.440" end="00:32:20.669" style="s2">freedom for anyone to take and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.260" end="00:32:21.899" style="s2">we I don&#39;t if you know this Michael but</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.669" end="00:32:23.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved from the very</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.899" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">beginning with a group called game B</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.820" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">that was one of the original game B team</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:33.390" style="s2">very similar things you&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.190" style="s2">similar things then and we do believe</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.390" end="00:32:38.520" style="s2">that this current crisis is going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.190" end="00:32:40.620" style="s2">open many ears to hear that perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.520" end="00:32:42.750" style="s2">know driving for the last penny of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.620" end="00:32:45.779" style="s2">economic efficiency by building this</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.750" end="00:32:47.820" style="s2">world-spanning machine that&#39;s optimized</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.290" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">group that&#39;s approximately like a parish</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:16.280" style="s2">that&#39;s you know 25 to 50 families that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.390" end="00:34:19.190" style="s2">is where the decision is made about what</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.280" end="00:34:21.560" style="s2">technologies to use and how I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.190" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">you an example one form of old order</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:27.790" style="s2">decided after a couple of years of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.190" end="00:34:30.590" style="s2">deliberation that it&#39;s okay to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.790" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">electricity in your barn so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.590" end="00:34:35.810" style="s2">run milking machines for your cows and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">refrigeration for the milk but it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:41.480" style="s2">and again you know nuanced while other</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.710" end="00:34:42.500" style="s2">groups of Mennonites say no electricity</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.480" end="00:34:44.450" style="s2">or I&#39;m Amish</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.500" end="00:34:46.820" style="s2">typically will say no electricity at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.450" end="00:34:48.980" style="s2">but sometimes while telephones right so</p>

<p begin="00:34:48.980" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">sick so they do it by deliberation at a</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:58.850" style="s2">know 25 to 50 families and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:00.680" style="s2">those ideas you know might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.850" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">interesting for our game be movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.680" end="00:35:04.790" style="s2">that we could produce what we call per</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.790" end="00:35:09.110" style="s2">each one may be quite different I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.580" end="00:35:12.920" style="s2">to give you another framing which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.110" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">been thinking about so there&#39;s and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.920" end="00:35:16.760" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of related to what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">just said so the so the basic idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.760" end="00:35:21.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s called with a difficult world</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:23.510" style="s2">wave those theory so these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.290" end="00:35:26.390" style="s2">historians from different schools so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.510" end="00:35:27.950" style="s2">have biophysical economics so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.390" end="00:35:29.840" style="s2">people think about the economy in</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.950" end="00:35:33.110" style="s2">thermodynamic ways your matter energy</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.840" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">flows you have Kaleo dynamics which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.110" end="00:35:36.710" style="s2">kind of looking at rhythms in history</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.710" end="00:35:42.350" style="s2">historians you have world Systems Theory</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.460" end="00:35:45.230" style="s2">Palestine and and others Karl Polanyi</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.350" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">the double movement idea so different</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.230" end="00:35:53.380" style="s2">ideas and here&#39;s the idea so</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">human history evolves between two</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.380" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">polarities of extraction and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:36:00.820" style="s2">regeneration and typically a class</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:03.940" style="s2">society which competes with you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.820" end="00:36:06.060" style="s2">other peers so nation states with</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.940" end="00:36:08.200" style="s2">nation-states empires against the Empire</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.060" end="00:36:10.450" style="s2">because they&#39;re in competition they will</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.200" end="00:36:12.220" style="s2">overuse their resources not as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.450" end="00:36:15.610" style="s2">exceptional thing but as a regular thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.220" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you know historically all</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.610" end="00:36:20.470" style="s2">civilizations that existed have</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">disappeared and so typically they do</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.470" end="00:36:26.110" style="s2">distant to the point of collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.210" end="00:36:28.870" style="s2">that arches in the pulse for the for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.110" end="00:36:32.710" style="s2">period of regeneration and so my thesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.870" end="00:36:35.470" style="s2">is that in these periods of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.710" end="00:36:37.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the commons that saves the day so</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.470" end="00:36:39.910" style="s2">the Commons are used as a healing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.060" end="00:36:42.310" style="s2">mechanisms for societies and economies</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.910" end="00:36:44.050" style="s2">which have overused their resources and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.310" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">the principle of the Commons is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.050" end="00:36:50.470" style="s2">mutualization right so think about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:53.650" style="s2">you have this highly predatory slave</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.470" end="00:36:56.520" style="s2">based Roman Empire which becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.650" end="00:36:59.560" style="s2">complex and start disintegrating and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.520" end="00:37:01.840" style="s2">what happens well what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.560" end="00:37:03.430" style="s2">Catholic monks you know mutual eyes</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.840" end="00:37:05.830" style="s2">their life so they have food and shelter</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.430" end="00:37:10.120" style="s2">and a rich spiritual life in a common</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.830" end="00:37:11.710" style="s2">setting freely chosen they utilize their</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.120" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">knowledge because there wasn&#39;t copyright</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.710" end="00:37:15.640" style="s2">and you know like the sister centers</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:18.520" style="s2">which is one of those congregations that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.640" end="00:37:21.160" style="s2">was created by st. Bernard&#39;s they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.520" end="00:37:24.370" style="s2">responsible 90% of the technological</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.160" end="00:37:25.540" style="s2">innovation in the 11-12 centuries you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.370" end="00:37:27.910" style="s2">know there were the engineers of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:30.040" style="s2">time right and then we localization of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:32.770" style="s2">the economy around the the feudal</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.040" end="00:37:34.990" style="s2">domains so I think you can see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.770" end="00:37:37.170" style="s2">trying to say is that you know when</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.990" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">there is an overreach of a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.170" end="00:37:42.460" style="s2">people go back to the Commons because</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:44.940" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the ways to dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.460" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">lower the human footprint while actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.940" end="00:37:51.580" style="s2">maintaining a good resource level and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:55.750" style="s2">you know psychologically let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.580" end="00:37:58.630" style="s2">all have a fenced you know garden if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.750" end="00:38:00.930" style="s2">unlucky I&#39;m hungry you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.630" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">but if we have an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.930" end="00:38:03.970" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:07.090" style="s2">you know there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.970" end="00:38:10.420" style="s2">reciprocity mechanisms then you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.090" end="00:38:12.460" style="s2">that if your garden doesn&#39;t function you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.420" end="00:38:14.080" style="s2">will still get what you need so this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.460" end="00:38:17.460" style="s2">what the Commons are psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.080" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s mutual eise&#39;s resources</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.460" end="00:38:23.380" style="s2">so that there&#39;s a kind of insurance that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:25.000" style="s2">people can use it and I think so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.380" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">brings me back to you to your idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.000" end="00:38:29.800" style="s2">the image you know they came from these</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:32.790" style="s2">periods where it was necessary to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.800" end="00:38:34.990" style="s2">that and you know they have the really</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.790" end="00:38:36.670" style="s2">symptoms being good enough so that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:39.400" style="s2">could persist over these long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.670" end="00:38:41.080" style="s2">time yeah it&#39;s quite amazing how and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.400" end="00:38:42.790" style="s2">well they do I mean we have number of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.080" end="00:38:45.070" style="s2">Mennonites very close to us in fact our</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.790" end="00:38:47.500" style="s2">county is now probably 10% Mennonite and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.070" end="00:38:49.330" style="s2">their farms are beautiful they take care</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.500" end="00:38:51.430" style="s2">of their animals they take care of their</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.330" end="00:38:53.620" style="s2">soil and they do a generation after</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.430" end="00:38:57.460" style="s2">generation and they&#39;re able to live</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.620" end="00:38:58.750" style="s2">within the game a world as we say in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.460" end="00:39:00.730" style="s2">game B and I know that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.750" end="00:39:02.860" style="s2">important theme that we&#39;ll get to later</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.730" end="00:39:05.800" style="s2">as we dig deeper into your book how</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.860" end="00:39:08.290" style="s2">peer-to-peer Commons and other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.800" end="00:39:10.150" style="s2">alternative organization can actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.290" end="00:39:11.320" style="s2">embed itself within the current</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.150" end="00:39:14.140" style="s2">structure at least for the time being</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.320" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">until working together we eventually all</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.140" end="00:39:19.450" style="s2">erode it away right which is really an</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:21.190" style="s2">important point let&#39;s stop here a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.450" end="00:39:22.930" style="s2">bit and let&#39;s dig in a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.190" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">into the idea of Commons we&#39;ve touched</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.930" end="00:39:28.450" style="s2">on it three or four times but we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:31.000" style="s2">really flushed it out a lot this is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:33.730" style="s2">important in fact I&#39;m reading in bits</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.000" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">and pieces of time between my readings</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.730" end="00:39:39.130" style="s2">for my podcast the book called free fair</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.190" end="00:39:41.650" style="s2">and alive by a guy named David Boyer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.130" end="00:39:43.180" style="s2">some other folks that really digs into</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.650" end="00:39:45.340" style="s2">the concept of the Commons that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.180" end="00:39:47.320" style="s2">really become more interested in it that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.340" end="00:39:48.670" style="s2">before but anyway so I&#39;ll let you talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.320" end="00:39:49.930" style="s2">about your vision of the Commons but one</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.670" end="00:39:52.120" style="s2">thing that we&#39;ll have to put on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.930" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">table whenever Commons comes up you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.120" end="00:39:56.110" style="s2">certainly have to address Garret Hardin</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:58.360" style="s2">and the idea of the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.110" end="00:40:00.730" style="s2">Commons and how you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.360" end="00:40:02.860" style="s2">nearer well anyway I&#39;d love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.730" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">view on that I have my view maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.860" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">speak after you&#39;re done yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.300" style="s2">ancient Romans already made a difference</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.110" end="00:40:12.910" style="s2">between what they called res new use</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.300" end="00:40:15.160" style="s2">what belongs to no one and it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.910" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">communists&#39; what belongs to a you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.160" end="00:40:19.720" style="s2">group of people or community and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:21.940" style="s2">basically the mistake of Garrett Hardin</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.720" end="00:40:24.190" style="s2">which he layer later on recognized is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.940" end="00:40:25.960" style="s2">that what he called the Commons were</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.190" end="00:40:29.800" style="s2">actually not Commons with open access</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.960" end="00:40:31.870" style="s2">resources so this is not you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.800" end="00:40:34.570" style="s2">mountain flanking in the Swiss village</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.870" end="00:40:36.670" style="s2">which is managed by the community but an</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.570" end="00:40:40.150" style="s2">open area that everybody can use and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.670" end="00:40:42.520" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s come it was right that open</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.150" end="00:40:45.790" style="s2">access resources often lead to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.520" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">tragedy but it was mistaken to call it</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.790" end="00:40:50.170" style="s2">the tragedy of the Commons because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:54.010" style="s2">Commons by definition is governed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.170" end="00:40:55.330" style="s2">exactly avoid that right so so he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.010" end="00:40:57.430" style="s2">really talking about Commons he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.330" end="00:41:00.100" style="s2">talking about open fields that were from</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.430" end="00:41:03.250" style="s2">no one and those are by definition not</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.100" end="00:41:06.820" style="s2">Commons but open access resources so as</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.250" end="00:41:09.210" style="s2">soon as people realize that that if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.820" end="00:41:11.890" style="s2">do this selfish thing that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.210" end="00:41:14.650" style="s2">resource will be the story they can make</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.890" end="00:41:16.600" style="s2">agreements amongst each other to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.650" end="00:41:18.790" style="s2">preserve that resource and then it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.600" end="00:41:21.370" style="s2">actually becomes a Commons and then they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.790" end="00:41:24.610" style="s2">can preserve it over generations so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.370" end="00:41:26.950" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the nuance and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.610" end="00:41:29.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that Gary Hart had actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.950" end="00:41:31.710" style="s2">said that you know he apologized for</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.260" end="00:41:35.490" style="s2">making a mistake because unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.710" end="00:41:37.870" style="s2">this mistaken you know kind of framing</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.490" end="00:41:40.900" style="s2">became one of the key ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.870" end="00:41:43.240" style="s2">neoliberalism and the idea that the only</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.900" end="00:41:46.660" style="s2">thing that works is a private market so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.240" end="00:41:48.670" style="s2">they used his ideas to basically you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.660" end="00:41:50.830" style="s2">know go to war even more against the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.670" end="00:41:52.690" style="s2">Commons and that&#39;s a very sad thing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.830" end="00:41:55.120" style="s2">this is still happening in Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.690" end="00:41:57.700" style="s2">Asia and Ukraine you know where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.120" end="00:42:00.970" style="s2">World Bank and the IMF are pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.700" end="00:42:04.210" style="s2">idea everywhere of privatizing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.970" end="00:42:05.860" style="s2">these mutual resources and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.210" end="00:42:08.110" style="s2">often it doesn&#39;t work the way they</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.860" end="00:42:11.020" style="s2">intend to do and and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.110" end="00:42:12.580" style="s2">real problem I agree 100% with what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:15.070" style="s2">said you hit it right on the nose that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.580" end="00:42:18.130" style="s2">people whip out Garrett Hardin like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.070" end="00:42:20.140" style="s2">weapon sometimes right even though what</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.130" end="00:42:23.800" style="s2">he was talking about was not anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.140" end="00:42:25.330" style="s2">like the normal socially managed Commons</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.800" end="00:42:28.820" style="s2">and of course we know Elinor Ostrom</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.330" end="00:42:32.460" style="s2">actually got a Nobel Prize in part for</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.820" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">analysis of you know how Commons are and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.460" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">ought to be managed and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">very different regime they are manager</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:41.220" style="s2">that what they&#39;re managed in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t money on money returned capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.220" end="00:42:46.260" style="s2">it&#39;s another one of these alternative</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">ways to do things may I mention one</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.260" end="00:42:49.470" style="s2">difference I have potentially with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:51.000" style="s2">book that you just mentioned and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.470" end="00:42:52.650" style="s2">know I have to say you know these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.000" end="00:42:54.300" style="s2">friends I work with them so we actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.650" end="00:42:55.830" style="s2">part of the same group for a while which</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.300" end="00:42:58.230" style="s2">was called the common strategies group</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.830" end="00:42:59.790" style="s2">and so we David Bailey and silky</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.230" end="00:43:02.760" style="s2">Helfrich the three of us we would</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.790" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">organize what we call deep dives and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.760" end="00:43:07.770" style="s2">these were like you know fairly</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:09.240" style="s2">confidential meetings we would put two</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.770" end="00:43:11.250" style="s2">groups of people together who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.240" end="00:43:13.830" style="s2">know each other for example commoners</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.250" end="00:43:16.920" style="s2">and and cooperatives or the commoners</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.830" end="00:43:18.090" style="s2">and ethical finance and so we you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.920" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">we did that for a number of years to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.090" end="00:43:22.710" style="s2">create bridges between these various</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:27.390" style="s2">communities but there&#39;s one point where</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.710" end="00:43:30.390" style="s2">I think we differ and this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.390" end="00:43:33.300" style="s2">notion of you know the relation between</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.390" end="00:43:37.140" style="s2">the Commons and the market because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:39.240" style="s2">seen passages where they explicitly say</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.140" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">you know that there can be no relation</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.240" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">with the market I could be mistaken so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:46.770" style="s2">would have to recheck it but okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.710" style="s2">whether they say it or not I just want</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.770" end="00:43:52.050" style="s2">to critique that position as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.710" end="00:43:54.690" style="s2">say that Commons are only for volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.050" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">that cannot have any relation with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.690" end="00:43:58.110" style="s2">market you know you put yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:44:00.540" style="s2">position where you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.110" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">resources and you you are marginal and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.540" end="00:44:04.500" style="s2">what usually happens is that after five</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:07.410" style="s2">or ten years the first generation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.500" end="00:44:09.690" style="s2">exhausted and if they are not replaced</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.410" end="00:44:12.900" style="s2">as the end of the project so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.690" end="00:44:15.120" style="s2">actually for institutional redesign in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.900" end="00:44:17.190" style="s2">which you would think about the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.120" end="00:44:20.190" style="s2">and then you think okay how can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.190" end="00:44:22.530" style="s2">create ethical livelihoods so that our</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.190" end="00:44:24.780" style="s2">Commons can persist over time I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.530" end="00:44:27.390" style="s2">this is a very important time so first</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.780" end="00:44:29.790" style="s2">at the micro level you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.390" end="00:44:31.710" style="s2">think about how do we do this for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.790" end="00:44:34.350" style="s2">long term what kind of you know income</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.710" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">streams and to do that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.350" end="00:44:39.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t endanger the comments right so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:41.530" style="s2">call it reverse co-optation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.420" end="00:44:44.050" style="s2">you mentioned Richard Bartlett and I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.530" end="00:44:46.570" style="s2">it was before our recording but so which</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.050" end="00:44:48.490" style="s2">aborted of we who is or used to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.570" end="00:44:51.700" style="s2">within spiral which is a coalition of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.490" end="00:44:55.360" style="s2">coops and social entrepreneurs in New</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.700" end="00:44:58.690" style="s2">Zealand you know they did something very</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.360" end="00:45:00.970" style="s2">interesting which I call transvestite</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:03.880" style="s2">so investment is using capital to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.970" end="00:45:05.710" style="s2">generate more capital transverse men is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.880" end="00:45:08.920" style="s2">using capital to create more comments</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.710" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">right you go you switch you transform it</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.920" end="00:45:13.540" style="s2">from one value system to another and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:16.510" style="s2">they took a million dollars to produce</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.540" end="00:45:21.640" style="s2">loomio which is an open source free</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.510" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">software they guaranteed 5% return for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.640" end="00:45:27.940" style="s2">10 years but then they did a ritual to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:29.500" style="s2">give the resource to the Commons so this</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.940" end="00:45:32.950" style="s2">is very interesting because at the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.500" end="00:45:35.400" style="s2">time they satisfy the investor but by</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.950" end="00:45:38.320" style="s2">really you know creating a wall between</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:40.270" style="s2">their entity and the investment so there</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.320" end="00:45:43.600" style="s2">they were not kind of in a slave-like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.270" end="00:45:45.100" style="s2">position to capital and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.600" end="00:45:47.350" style="s2">they created more comment so this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.100" end="00:45:49.450" style="s2">something I described in the book is how</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.350" end="00:45:53.410" style="s2">do we do what I call reverse co-optation</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.450" end="00:45:56.680" style="s2">right so how do we protect ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.410" end="00:46:00.190" style="s2">commoners how do we maintain our ethics</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.680" end="00:46:04.050" style="s2">and values and create equitable and fair</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.190" end="00:46:07.450" style="s2">livelihoods without being overrun by</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.050" end="00:46:09.880" style="s2">more predatory instincts this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.450" end="00:46:11.950" style="s2">problem that coops many times that right</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.880" end="00:46:14.290" style="s2">coops have two big problems one is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.950" end="00:46:16.540" style="s2">called managerialism which is over time</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.290" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">there is an elite that becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.540" end="00:46:21.210" style="s2">becomes managers and they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">involved all the memories anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.210" end="00:46:26.170" style="s2">but also what&#39;s called worker capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">which is yes you disability differently</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.170" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">but you&#39;re behaving the same as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:36.360" style="s2">competitive firm and so my concern is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:39.850" style="s2">how do you avoid this how do you create</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.360" end="00:46:43.030" style="s2">you know Commons that are in relation</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.850" end="00:46:44.590" style="s2">with generative market functions so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.030" end="00:46:46.660" style="s2">both can continue to exist in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.590" end="00:46:48.940" style="s2">equilibrium over a longer period of time</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.660" end="00:46:52.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s what you&#39;ll find in my book it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.940" end="00:46:54.040" style="s2">is attempt to you know kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.120" end="00:46:54.630" style="s2">institutional design so the commons</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.040" end="00:46:55.769" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.630" end="00:46:58.049" style="s2">market institution in the state</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.769" end="00:47:00.029" style="s2">institution first of the micro-level</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.049" end="00:47:03.480" style="s2">where you have the productive community</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.029" end="00:47:05.400" style="s2">the intrapreneurial coalition nd what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.480" end="00:47:07.140" style="s2">call the for benefit Association you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.400" end="00:47:09.299" style="s2">will note that most open-source projects</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.140" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">have some Association which manages the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.299" end="00:47:13.529" style="s2">infrastructure and the collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:16.740" style="s2">infrastructure like in a Linux</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.529" end="00:47:18.779" style="s2">Foundation Drupal Association and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.740" end="00:47:21.990" style="s2">project it at the level of society so</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.779" end="00:47:23.670" style="s2">can we imagine a society where civil</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.990" end="00:47:26.220" style="s2">society is considered to be productive</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.670" end="00:47:28.410" style="s2">because every citizen every inhabitant</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.220" end="00:47:31.950" style="s2">actually contributes to the common good</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.410" end="00:47:35.069" style="s2">and we recognize that can we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.950" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">market that doesn&#39;t destroy communities</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.069" end="00:47:40.849" style="s2">and natural resources and can we have an</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:43.559" style="s2">enabling what I call a partner state</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.849" end="00:47:46.730" style="s2">which creates the conditions that every</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.559" end="00:47:49.109" style="s2">citizen can equally participate in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.730" end="00:47:51.390" style="s2">contributory economy so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.109" end="00:47:54.660" style="s2">my what I call post capitalist dream is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.390" end="00:47:58.200" style="s2">to have healthy markets healthy civil</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.660" end="00:48:00.180" style="s2">societies and healthy state forms which</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.200" end="00:48:02.819" style="s2">can create you know a bit what the image</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.180" end="00:48:05.970" style="s2">do right is create long term stability</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.819" end="00:48:08.190" style="s2">within planetary boundaries and we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.970" end="00:48:10.680" style="s2">examples on a large scale and I recently</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.190" end="00:48:14.759" style="s2">discovered this which is the Tokugawa</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.680" end="00:48:16.230" style="s2">period in Japan which lasted I think two</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.759" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">to three centuries I&#39;m not sure about</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.230" end="00:48:24.420" style="s2">the timing but they have a balanced</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:26.309" style="s2">economy with a stable population that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.420" end="00:48:29.609" style="s2">live within the regional planetary</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.309" end="00:48:32.460" style="s2">boundaries of Japan so we know we can do</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.609" end="00:48:34.049" style="s2">it and we know that we need the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.460" end="00:48:35.960" style="s2">to really do this because actually what</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.049" end="00:48:38.730" style="s2">happened was that the Emperor the Shogun</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.960" end="00:48:41.940" style="s2">had taken over the land from these you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.730" end="00:48:44.609" style="s2">know rival feudal boards and and created</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.940" end="00:48:45.960" style="s2">rules to avoid deforestation so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.609" end="00:48:48.569" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty interesting you know these</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:52.859" style="s2">kinds of macro solutions that use the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.569" end="00:48:55.859" style="s2">Commons as a tool to maintain stable</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.859" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">societies yeah and I think what we just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.859" end="00:48:58.529" style="s2">talked about here and which as you say</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:01.799" style="s2">is in your book and you give some good</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.529" end="00:49:04.470" style="s2">examples in Chapter two which we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.799" end="00:49:07.619" style="s2">to in a bit at least two of them that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.470" end="00:49:08.520" style="s2">key question is not only long term but</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.619" end="00:49:10.350" style="s2">also how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.520" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">there you know I was in my earlier days</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.350" end="00:49:16.200" style="s2">a startup entrepreneur that I was an</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:19.470" style="s2">investor in startups etc and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.200" end="00:49:21.630" style="s2">rules I used for my own ventures and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.470" end="00:49:24.330" style="s2">investing in others and such is to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.630" end="00:49:26.760" style="s2">realize that nobody ever jumps up a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.330" end="00:49:29.430" style="s2">cliff right it just doesn&#39;t happen you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.760" end="00:49:31.560" style="s2">got to find a hill to walk up and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.430" end="00:49:34.350" style="s2">know here we are surrounded on all sides</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.560" end="00:49:37.500" style="s2">by this amazingly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.350" end="00:49:40.350" style="s2">if stupid and brutal machine which we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.500" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">call game a that is driven by money on</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.350" end="00:49:44.910" style="s2">money return but also has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.980" style="s2">freedom in it and one of the freedoms is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.910" end="00:49:49.890" style="s2">to be able to build your own thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.980" end="00:49:52.890" style="s2">inside of it and in fact in our game be</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.890" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">concept we&#39;re less doctrinaire about</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.890" end="00:49:57.600" style="s2">commons per se that we do understand the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:59.430" style="s2">commons have to be a driving concept at</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.600" end="00:50:01.800" style="s2">the highest level with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.430" end="00:50:03.630" style="s2">global systems but we are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.800" end="00:50:05.480" style="s2">Commons we&#39;re interested in coops we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:07.800" style="s2">interested in almost any kind of</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:16.530" style="s2">and here is the most important thing be</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.470" end="00:50:18.930" style="s2">able to out-compete gamej entities at</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.530" end="00:50:20.670" style="s2">least in some sectors because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:23.610" style="s2">jump up a cliff we can&#39;t get to this</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.670" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">post capitalist world immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.610" end="00:50:27.390" style="s2">probably the only roads there</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.920" style="s2">immediately would be through violent</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.390" end="00:50:31.020" style="s2">revolution where we&#39;re more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.920" end="00:50:33.420" style="s2">end up with feudalism or neo-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.020" end="00:50:35.730" style="s2">than we are what you and I want so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.420" end="00:50:38.250" style="s2">been thinking about how can we assure</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.730" end="00:50:40.290" style="s2">that these entities are realistic and as</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.250" end="00:50:41.820" style="s2">you say provide real livings for</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.290" end="00:50:45.090" style="s2">themselves some of which may well be</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.820" end="00:50:46.620" style="s2">engaging with game a at some level but</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.090" end="00:50:49.640" style="s2">doing it in a way that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.620" end="00:50:53.250" style="s2">live true to yourself in a game B or</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.640" end="00:50:55.470" style="s2">common or way and yet define those you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.250" end="00:50:56.790" style="s2">use the word membranes and I refine that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.470" end="00:50:59.670" style="s2">word a little further and call it semi</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.790" end="00:51:02.730" style="s2">permeable membranes in the biological</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.670" end="00:51:04.290" style="s2">realm every cell has a membrane but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.730" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">membrane has been designed by evolution</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.290" end="00:51:10.110" style="s2">very carefully for what it both what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">in and what it puts out and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.110" end="00:51:15.420" style="s2">think in terms of semi permeable</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:17.370" style="s2">membranes being our operating entities</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.420" end="00:51:19.290" style="s2">at around the Dunbar number or maybe</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.730" end="00:51:28.710" style="s2">make stuff to sell the game a world but</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.280" end="00:51:30.390" style="s2">yet we live like game be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.710" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">examples I give just because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.390" end="00:51:34.290" style="s2">absurd seemingly especially to white</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:37.110" style="s2">people who come from the hippie-dippie</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.290" end="00:51:39.660" style="s2">kind of point of view which is could you</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.110" end="00:51:42.630" style="s2">want to imagine a game be auto repair</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.660" end="00:51:45.330" style="s2">business right what you know fixing</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.630" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">those pollution belching demons</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.330" end="00:51:49.020" style="s2">I go hey the world is full of auto</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.490" style="s2">repair businesses and most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.020" end="00:51:52.650" style="s2">very out or not most of them but many of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.490" end="00:51:54.660" style="s2">them are very unethical right they rip</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.650" end="00:51:56.580" style="s2">people off they charge them for parts</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.660" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t put in they buy cheap</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.580" end="00:52:01.500" style="s2">knockoff parts from China and charge you</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.800" end="00:52:35.670" style="s2">and how do we out-compete what we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.170" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">compete by being ethical</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.670" end="00:52:39.990" style="s2">by having worker management of the floor</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:41.340" style="s2">I happen to have worked in the auto</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.990" end="00:52:42.750" style="s2">business when I first got out of college</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.340" end="00:52:44.820" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably why I know about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.750" end="00:52:46.710" style="s2">example but within an auto repair</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.820" end="00:52:50.190" style="s2">business there&#39;s horrible tension</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.710" end="00:52:52.500" style="s2">rivalry and fighting between the service</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.190" end="00:52:53.970" style="s2">writers are the ones who interface to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.500" end="00:52:56.130" style="s2">the customer and typically the ones</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.970" end="00:52:58.320" style="s2">trying to rip you off and the workers</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.130" end="00:53:00.900" style="s2">the mechanics the people who turn the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.320" end="00:53:03.090" style="s2">cranks who mostly want to do a good job</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.900" end="00:53:05.010" style="s2">and then the parch department who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.090" end="00:53:07.590" style="s2">always trying to pressure the mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.010" end="00:53:09.900" style="s2">to buy as many parts as possible or get</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.590" end="00:53:12.180" style="s2">in bed as many parts as possible and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.900" end="00:53:14.370" style="s2">repair job whether it&#39;s necessary or not</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.180" end="00:53:16.080" style="s2">you wonder why all they do these days is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.370" end="00:53:17.700" style="s2">just replace parts because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.080" end="00:53:18.930" style="s2">parts department trying to muscle the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.700" end="00:53:21.420" style="s2">mechanics to do so</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.930" end="00:53:23.610" style="s2">so our view is that or at least my view</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.420" end="00:53:25.740" style="s2">I should say this is purely my crazy</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.610" end="00:53:28.290" style="s2">idea is that if you were to organize</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.740" end="00:53:30.630" style="s2">using game B principles in this very</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.290" end="00:53:32.580" style="s2">game a business you&#39;d out compete the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.630" end="00:53:34.650" style="s2">game a player&#39;s in your town very</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.580" end="00:53:35.720" style="s2">quickly the word would get out Wow auto</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.650" end="00:53:38.180" style="s2">repair business</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.720" end="00:53:39.950" style="s2">totally ethical probably 10% cheaper and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.180" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">they don&#39;t sell you crap you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.950" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">and you could use that economic profit</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:47.840" style="s2">from the game a world to basically keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:50.300" style="s2">the game be world going until gradually</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.840" end="00:53:52.700" style="s2">we build our own economy and trade with</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.300" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">each other well you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.700" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just saying is a bit what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:53:57.980" style="s2">co-operative movement learned in 19th</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:01.940" style="s2">century you know first they tried to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.980" end="00:54:03.470" style="s2">build productive co-ops but they they</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.940" end="00:54:06.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t succeed because they couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.470" end="00:54:08.690" style="s2">the capital from banks and and and so so</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.590" end="00:54:12.500" style="s2">they they kind of moved to consumer</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.690" end="00:54:14.119" style="s2">coops and so what they decided and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.500" end="00:54:17.030" style="s2">forgot the name of the Rochdale pioneers</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.119" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">right so they did they knew that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.030" end="00:54:24.140" style="s2">could deliver food to the workers with</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:26.840" style="s2">30% less than the private shops but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.140" end="00:54:28.490" style="s2">also knew that if they did that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.840" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">would create so much animosity and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.490" end="00:54:34.840" style="s2">would probably be destroyed so what they</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:38.540" style="s2">did was give 10% discount a set of 30</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.840" end="00:54:40.250" style="s2">and so they had 20% surplus that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.540" end="00:54:41.750" style="s2">invested to grow the co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.250" end="00:54:44.089" style="s2">movement and they were extremely</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.750" end="00:54:45.530" style="s2">successful and I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.089" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">this but there are more people today</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.530" end="00:54:49.910" style="s2">working in co-ops are working for</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.460" style="s2">multinationals and there&#39;s a study in</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.910" end="00:54:55.099" style="s2">France showing their technical ops you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.460" end="00:54:58.010" style="s2">know have a 5-time less chance of going</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.099" end="00:55:00.619" style="s2">bust and then the venture capital take</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.010" end="00:55:02.000" style="s2">startups the problem is that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.619" end="00:55:04.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know that right they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.000" end="00:55:07.130" style="s2">that these things exist so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.910" end="00:55:10.369" style="s2">strategy I talked a lot about seed</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.130" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">Forbes right did the idea that when a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.369" end="00:55:14.839" style="s2">system is breaking down and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.150" style="s2">the idea that we&#39;re now entering this</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.839" end="00:55:18.560" style="s2">downward spiral you know if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.150" end="00:55:21.080" style="s2">what I said in beginning this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.560" end="00:55:24.050" style="s2">wave poles between extraction engine and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.080" end="00:55:25.700" style="s2">generative periods what campuses</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.050" end="00:55:27.589" style="s2">achieved to do is to create an</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.700" end="00:55:30.290" style="s2">extractive period which lasts it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.589" end="00:55:33.980" style="s2">very long and has culminated in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.290" end="00:55:35.660" style="s2">globalized overuse so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.980" end="00:55:38.270" style="s2">unpleasant situation because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.660" end="00:55:42.770" style="s2">escape we&#39;ve reached this overreach at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.270" end="00:55:44.660" style="s2">global scale and so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.770" end="00:55:46.790" style="s2">these periods is that people look for</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.660" end="00:55:48.770" style="s2">solution which obviously will not have</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.790" end="00:55:50.780" style="s2">the same logic</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.770" end="00:55:53.420" style="s2">the system that that is less and less</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.780" end="00:55:55.610" style="s2">functioning and so this is what I call</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.420" end="00:55:58.100" style="s2">seed form so for example you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.610" end="00:56:00.950" style="s2">beginning of capitalism you know it took</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.100" end="00:56:03.470" style="s2">eight centuries to prepare for four</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.950" end="00:56:06.380" style="s2">modern capitalist society but it begins</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.470" end="00:56:07.610" style="s2">with I&#39;m sure you know that story but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.380" end="00:56:10.190" style="s2">find it interesting is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.610" end="00:56:13.160" style="s2">invention of purgatory right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.190" end="00:56:16.100" style="s2">the Italian cities and at that time</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.160" end="00:56:18.980" style="s2">usery was defined as just asking</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.100" end="00:56:22.760" style="s2">interest so if you ask for interest you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.980" end="00:56:24.050" style="s2">go to hell so then they they because</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.760" end="00:56:26.630" style="s2">there was a lot of pressure you know in</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.050" end="00:56:28.610" style="s2">the Italian city-states they started</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.630" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">thinking about purgatory which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.610" end="00:56:34.250" style="s2">convenient solution so they defined</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:37.160" style="s2">lending interests no longer as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.250" end="00:56:40.130" style="s2">cardinal sin but as a kind of moderate</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.160" end="00:56:42.500" style="s2">sin and then you could buy back your sin</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.130" end="00:56:44.420" style="s2">by buying indulgences which a church</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.500" end="00:56:47.270" style="s2">used to in you know investing their cut</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.420" end="00:56:48.890" style="s2">in their Gothic cathedrals and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.270" end="00:56:50.690" style="s2">Christians could lend money so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.890" end="00:56:52.940" style="s2">that&#39;s like an invention you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.690" end="00:56:54.530" style="s2">pattern that would eventually enable the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.940" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">capitals then you have double-entry book</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.530" end="00:57:00.590" style="s2">account then you have the printing press</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:03.320" style="s2">right so you could identify a number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.590" end="00:57:05.410" style="s2">things that like existing seed confers</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.320" end="00:57:07.580" style="s2">and they find each other and they create</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.410" end="00:57:09.070" style="s2">organization which used two or three or</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.580" end="00:57:11.380" style="s2">four or five of these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.070" end="00:57:14.990" style="s2">eventually create a subsystem and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.380" end="00:57:16.730" style="s2">eventually that subsystems takes over so</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.990" end="00:57:18.800" style="s2">this is the way I think that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.730" end="00:57:21.470" style="s2">the period where we have to create seed</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.800" end="00:57:24.470" style="s2">forms and look for niches where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.470" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">viable and at the same time we work at</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.470" end="00:57:30.080" style="s2">changing the rules of society so that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:32.600" style="s2">can do this more and more right so what</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.080" end="00:57:36.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve done is hacking another example</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.600" end="00:57:39.290" style="s2">you gave about the guild system but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.590" end="00:57:41.690" style="s2">can also change legislation more radical</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.290" end="00:57:43.670" style="s2">ways for example in Italy you know they</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.690" end="00:57:45.830" style="s2">have the public Commons cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.670" end="00:57:47.590" style="s2">protocols so that started in Bologna</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.830" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">actually it started with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.590" end="00:57:53.180" style="s2">constitutional reform in which they</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:55.130" style="s2">introduced the notion of subsidiarity so</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.180" end="00:57:59.690" style="s2">that democracy should be done at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.130" end="00:58:01.400" style="s2">lowest reasonable level and so no no</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.690" end="00:58:02.150" style="s2">centralization wouldn&#39;t when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.400" end="00:58:04.460" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.150" end="00:58:07.190" style="s2">and they use it in bologna to create a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.460" end="00:58:10.819" style="s2">rule that allows citizens to claim</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.190" end="00:58:13.750" style="s2">something as a commons so you can say I</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.819" end="00:58:17.210" style="s2">want to take care of the riverbeds I</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.750" end="00:58:19.849" style="s2">want to rejuvenate this old factory</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.210" end="00:58:23.329" style="s2">which is abandoned I want to wreak the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.849" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">dynamized at the park and so this was so</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.329" end="00:58:28.670" style="s2">successful Jim that it went to 250,000</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:30.770" style="s2">cities and that now 1 million people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.670" end="00:58:33.799" style="s2">doing urban Commons projects in Italian</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.770" end="00:58:36.920" style="s2">cities so this is how you get from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.799" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">niche to a new norm does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.920" end="00:58:40.789" style="s2">I like it a lot yeah a couple of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:43.250" style="s2">restricts earlier I did not know the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.789" end="00:58:45.440" style="s2">story that purgatory was a loophole for</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.250" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">letting money at interest I love that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:50.089" style="s2">actually yeah this is a bicycle a goof</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:52.309" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested that he has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.089" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">book about that and I read it some years</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.309" end="00:58:56.630" style="s2">ago quite easily but you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:58.609" style="s2">more relevant today is this idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.630" end="00:59:00.980" style="s2">know a seed starting in one place of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.609" end="00:59:02.510" style="s2">having the ability to find commons in</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.980" end="00:59:04.220" style="s2">bologna and then having that spread</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.510" end="00:59:06.170" style="s2">across all of italy that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.220" end="00:59:08.240" style="s2">fan out i think we&#39;re both hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.170" end="00:59:10.190" style="s2">our work will lead to overtime because</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:12.170" style="s2">you have to have existence proofs i keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.190" end="00:59:14.569" style="s2">coming back to this yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.170" end="00:59:17.210" style="s2">and I call this protocol cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.569" end="00:59:19.309" style="s2">and I let you speak that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.210" end="00:59:20.839" style="s2">explain what that means okay that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.309" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">great yeah just a very short thing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.839" end="00:59:25.730" style="s2">that one of my frustrations in some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:27.410" style="s2">these social change groups is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.730" end="00:59:29.660" style="s2">lot of people want to spend a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.410" end="00:59:31.430" style="s2">of time talking about theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.660" end="00:59:34.670" style="s2">good I like theory I can go deep on</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.430" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">theory when I need to but to get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.670" end="00:59:39.589" style="s2">the you know 1% elite thinkers of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">world you got to have existence proofs</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.589" end="00:59:45.109" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna take anybody&#39;s word</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:47.599" style="s2">that some high concept way to redo the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.109" end="00:59:49.279" style="s2">world is gonna make life better for them</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:52.339" style="s2">and their families you got to see it</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.279" end="00:59:56.299" style="s2">work so I&#39;m always looking for tangible</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.339" end="00:59:58.730" style="s2">homey down-to-earth and preferably rival</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.299" end="01:00:00.950" style="s2">risks examples of things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.730" end="01:00:03.079" style="s2">actually show that our theories work and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.950" end="01:00:04.730" style="s2">I&#39;m an empiricist if our theories turn</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.079" end="01:00:07.579" style="s2">out not to work then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.730" end="01:00:09.140" style="s2">wrong with our theories I&#39;m completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.579" end="01:00:11.390" style="s2">on your side on that and actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.140" end="01:00:13.789" style="s2">what the p2p foundation does so we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.390" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">20,000 articles and concepts and</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.789" end="01:00:17.840" style="s2">examples oh and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:21.320" style="s2">Rule two be in our wiki is that you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.840" end="01:00:23.000" style="s2">to exist so the concepts I have are</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.320" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">considered are actually used by</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.000" end="01:00:28.430" style="s2">communities that exist and the projects</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:30.380" style="s2">that I use are not plans but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.430" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">actually communities and project that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.380" end="01:00:35.000" style="s2">already exists you know sometimes they</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">exist in experimental form but they</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.000" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">exist you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:40.910" style="s2">absolutely and we have to prototype we</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:43.220" style="s2">have to experiment right and I build my</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.910" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">theory based on what I see in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.220" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">reality so that&#39;s really how I works</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:49.970" style="s2">it&#39;s very close to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:52.610" style="s2">yeah I love it</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.970" end="01:00:54.380" style="s2">and I obviously knew about your work and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.610" end="01:00:56.390" style="s2">your foundation but I hadn&#39;t really dug</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.380" end="01:00:58.220" style="s2">deep into it and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.390" end="01:01:00.230" style="s2">I really love about doing my podcast I</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.220" end="01:01:02.870" style="s2">do spend about 10 hours per episode</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.230" end="01:01:05.480" style="s2">digging into people&#39;s materials the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.870" end="01:01:07.790" style="s2">amount of stuff I found on your wiki in</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.480" end="01:01:09.830" style="s2">particular was holy moly I could spend a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.790" end="01:01:11.720" style="s2">month they get into that the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.830" end="01:01:13.640" style="s2">resource of yours I&#39;d call out to people</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.720" end="01:01:16.820" style="s2">which I now follow it is you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.640" end="01:01:18.710" style="s2">daily blog post as well which is well</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.820" end="01:01:20.390" style="s2">worth following and I had it written</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.710" end="01:01:23.240" style="s2">down here where the hell is it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.390" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">block doped p2p foundations of nets and</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.240" end="01:01:28.100" style="s2">then we have Commons transitions org yep</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:30.230" style="s2">so there&#39;s a huge amount of very useful</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.100" end="01:01:32.930" style="s2">material which actually is our perfect</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.230" end="01:01:35.420" style="s2">pivot to my next topic which is actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.930" end="01:01:37.550" style="s2">from Chapter two in your book sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.420" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">two parts to this first you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.550" end="01:01:42.590" style="s2">value and what is value exchange value</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:44.300" style="s2">versus use value like you get you talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.590" end="01:01:46.520" style="s2">about that a little bit but then you you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.300" end="01:01:48.590" style="s2">dig into for examples and I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.520" end="01:01:51.020" style="s2">particularly interested again my bias</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.590" end="01:01:53.210" style="s2">towards tangible and how do we apply</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.020" end="01:01:56.060" style="s2">these concepts to the rival risk domain</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.210" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">to the examples of wiki house and farm</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.060" end="01:02:04.280" style="s2">hack okay yes so I I do want to say a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:05.900" style="s2">bit about value because I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.280" end="01:02:08.780" style="s2">talked about this and this is so</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.900" end="01:02:10.940" style="s2">important so you know somewhere I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.780" end="01:02:13.940" style="s2">in the 17th century we decided that</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.940" end="01:02:17.080" style="s2">value could only be created in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.940" end="01:02:19.490" style="s2">market so you need you know kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.080" end="01:02:22.670" style="s2">commodity that you can sell on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.490" end="01:02:25.010" style="s2">market and that creates value so to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.670" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">it simple you have three nurses one is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.010" end="01:02:30.300" style="s2">volunteer for the mother teresa&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:32.390" style="s2">comfort congregation and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.300" end="01:02:35.460" style="s2">she&#39;s not counted anywhere in the GDP</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.390" end="01:02:37.830" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t get a salary she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.460" end="01:02:41.100" style="s2">exist then you have a nurse that works</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.830" end="01:02:42.330" style="s2">for a public hospital and she&#39;s come to</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.100" end="01:02:44.520" style="s2">the cost so when there&#39;s an economic</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.330" end="01:02:47.010" style="s2">crisis we spend too much the public</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.520" end="01:02:49.070" style="s2">hospital will be closed and she loses a</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.010" end="01:02:51.810" style="s2">job and then there&#39;s a third nurse and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.070" end="01:02:54.180" style="s2">she works a private hospital and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.810" end="01:02:56.610" style="s2">you know a positive force in our society</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.180" end="01:02:58.890" style="s2">because she creates surplus value for</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.610" end="01:03:00.780" style="s2">its shareholders so this is what the</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.890" end="01:03:04.710" style="s2">value regime does you have three people</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.780" end="01:03:06.930" style="s2">doing the same job and only one is</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.710" end="01:03:09.330" style="s2">recognized as being a value creator</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.930" end="01:03:11.490" style="s2">right and this is a big problem because</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.330" end="01:03:13.800" style="s2">what it means is that we can only fund</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.490" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">regenerative activity in our society</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.800" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">either to taxation or philanthropy so</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:23.550" style="s2">first we have to extract accumulate</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">profit and capital to our extraction and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.550" end="01:03:28.970" style="s2">then eventually you know we can invest</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:31.530" style="s2">through taxation or philanthropy in</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.970" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">things that are good you know more</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.530" end="01:03:35.970" style="s2">generative for the world and this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:39.780" style="s2">this means that as long as we are in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.970" end="01:03:43.370" style="s2">this value regime we cannot structurally</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.780" end="01:03:47.310" style="s2">solve our problems and so any real</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.370" end="01:03:50.040" style="s2">change in civilizational paradigm is</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.310" end="01:03:51.510" style="s2">also a change in value regime right just</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.040" end="01:03:54.660" style="s2">to give another example you have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.510" end="01:03:57.720" style="s2">Romans they have slaves work is for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.660" end="01:03:59.910" style="s2">slaves work is not good a free person is</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.720" end="01:04:02.160" style="s2">a person that doesn&#39;t work so that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.910" end="01:04:04.770" style="s2">can you know dedicate its time to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:07.080" style="s2">philosophy and stuff that&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.770" end="01:04:10.050" style="s2">the ancient Greeks and the Romans then</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.080" end="01:04:12.930" style="s2">the cretins come in and what they say is</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.050" end="01:04:16.890" style="s2">no no no over at la bruja we have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.930" end="01:04:19.350" style="s2">pray and work and work becomes a scene</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.890" end="01:04:21.600" style="s2">as a way to bring in you know the divine</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.350" end="01:04:24.200" style="s2">order in the Indian dear on the planet</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.600" end="01:04:27.690" style="s2">Earth so you see that the medieval</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.200" end="01:04:29.310" style="s2">system is actually a value revolution</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.690" end="01:04:31.140" style="s2">compared to the Roman system right so</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.310" end="01:04:32.790" style="s2">you have this kind and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.140" end="01:04:34.620" style="s2">suggesting to you Jim is that we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.790" end="01:04:37.580" style="s2">going to move from a commodity based</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.620" end="01:04:41.430" style="s2">value system to a contribution based</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.580" end="01:04:44.349" style="s2">value system and so that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.430" end="01:04:48.200" style="s2">crucial so it we have to find mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.349" end="01:04:50.180" style="s2">that allow us to do that and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.200" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">give you an example and this is from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.180" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">blockchain world right so maybe two</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:59.990" style="s2">examples to make it a bit real one is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:03.049" style="s2">the idea of a shared public ledger to</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.990" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">directly finance generative work so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.049" end="01:05:07.940" style="s2">example is tale data it&#39;s community</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:11.900" style="s2">lanterns in France with 70 million</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.450" end="01:05:24.619" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to D pollute because they</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.710" end="01:05:25.880" style="s2">don&#39;t pollute the water and the problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.619" end="01:05:27.769" style="s2">is so today&#39;s we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.880" end="01:05:30.259" style="s2">mechanism to do this but imagine we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.769" end="01:05:33.769" style="s2">a public ledger right like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.259" end="01:05:37.009" style="s2">blockchain people are doing and so any</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.769" end="01:05:40.730" style="s2">person could say here is the proof of my</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.009" end="01:05:42.500" style="s2">decarbonisation effort right so you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.730" end="01:05:44.359" style="s2">very fine and confirmed you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.500" end="01:05:47.480" style="s2">tokenized and then either the state</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.359" end="01:05:49.099" style="s2">decides is a priority or you go to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.480" end="01:05:51.380" style="s2">institutions and companies that profit</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.099" end="01:05:54.109" style="s2">from your positive externalities as they</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.380" end="01:05:56.599" style="s2">call it and that way you have a direct</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.109" end="01:05:59.390" style="s2">financing of generative work so this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.599" end="01:06:01.190" style="s2">called circular Finance like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.390" end="01:06:03.980" style="s2">circular economy need circular Finance</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.190" end="01:06:06.039" style="s2">and what Weis is interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.980" end="01:06:09.170" style="s2">what you can do is you can build in</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.039" end="01:06:10.940" style="s2">limits like planetary boundary limits</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.170" end="01:06:13.339" style="s2">and this is something called global</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.940" end="01:06:15.619" style="s2">thresholds and allocations the group is</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.339" end="01:06:17.329" style="s2">called reporting 3.0 so you have this</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.619" end="01:06:20.359" style="s2">council that keeps track of all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.329" end="01:06:22.460" style="s2">resources in the world and how much we</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.359" end="01:06:24.829" style="s2">can use without destroying the planet</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.460" end="01:06:26.269" style="s2">because you have all the freedoms but</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.829" end="01:06:28.579" style="s2">not the freedom to destroy the planet</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.269" end="01:06:30.470" style="s2">and we can integrate it in in our</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.579" end="01:06:32.930" style="s2">accounting system so that people know</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.470" end="01:06:35.420" style="s2">the choices that they have but within</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.930" end="01:06:37.490" style="s2">that you are completely free you know to</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.420" end="01:06:39.559" style="s2">solve your issues as you see fit as long</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.490" end="01:06:42.529" style="s2">as you don&#39;t destroy go over the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.559" end="01:06:43.670" style="s2">planetary boundaries ok so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.529" end="01:06:46.369" style="s2">to say this because this is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.670" end="01:06:48.910" style="s2">important as the underlying you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.369" end="01:06:51.829" style="s2">system that that I described in the book</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.910" end="01:06:55.910" style="s2">so the two examples you were asking were</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.829" end="01:06:57.690" style="s2">farm hack farm hack it Wiki house yes so</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.910" end="01:06:59.160" style="s2">instead of harm hack</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.690" end="01:07:00.869" style="s2">which I don&#39;t know very because that</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.160" end="01:07:02.790" style="s2">that case that it was written by my</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.869" end="01:07:05.910" style="s2">co-author there is a similar group in</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.790" end="01:07:07.800" style="s2">France it&#39;s called attorney Basel so</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.910" end="01:07:09.990" style="s2">what they do is they come together every</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.800" end="01:07:14.100" style="s2">two weeks you know regional workshop and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.990" end="01:07:16.140" style="s2">they make a machine together right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.100" end="01:07:18.810" style="s2">because their idea is that agribusiness</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.140" end="01:07:22.740" style="s2">firms do not make the machines that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.810" end="01:07:25.619" style="s2">more smaller family-oriented farmers</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.740" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">need so they will do it themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.619" end="01:07:29.130" style="s2">so every two weeks they make a machine</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:32.310" style="s2">that somebody needs in their network and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.130" end="01:07:35.070" style="s2">they will put the design in a global</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.310" end="01:07:36.510" style="s2">Commons it&#39;s in French so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.070" end="01:07:38.490" style="s2">limitation but you know they had like</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.510" end="01:07:40.350" style="s2">2,000 designs already like three four</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.490" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">years ago and you know they have</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.350" end="01:07:44.910" style="s2">hundreds of members and they are active</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:47.250" style="s2">in the whole country of France so this</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.910" end="01:07:49.290" style="s2">is a very interesting project that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.250" end="01:07:50.790" style="s2">know a bit better and I think farm hack</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.290" end="01:07:53.810" style="s2">is quite similar so these are just</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.790" end="01:07:56.369" style="s2">people young farmers mostly that</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.810" end="01:07:58.470" style="s2">basically create share designs of things</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.369" end="01:08:00.600" style="s2">they need in their work and you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.470" end="01:08:01.890" style="s2">they hack farm machinery because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.600" end="01:08:05.310" style="s2">sure you know this right if you buy a</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.890" end="01:08:08.100" style="s2">John Deere tractor it&#39;s illegal to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.310" end="01:08:10.200" style="s2">repair it because you sign a contract</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.100" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">which includes the software on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.200" end="01:08:15.240" style="s2">machine and its private software and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.950" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to change it you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.240" end="01:08:18.930" style="s2">so this creates kind of a new feudalism</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.950" end="01:08:20.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what these groups kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.930" end="01:08:22.529" style="s2">know act against Sawicki house I know a</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.700" end="01:08:24.870" style="s2">bit better because I&#39;ve visited them in</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.529" end="01:08:27.960" style="s2">New Zealand and basically they want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.870" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">make a zero carbon positive I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.960" end="01:08:34.739" style="s2">called a house and again the idea is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:37.500" style="s2">work together in community and to share</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.739" end="01:08:40.410" style="s2">the design globally so that if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.500" end="01:08:44.190" style="s2">successful other people can simply then</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.410" end="01:08:46.980" style="s2">you know copy the design and do it in</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.190" end="01:08:48.870" style="s2">another locality may be adapted and so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.980" end="01:08:51.089" style="s2">come back to I wanted to say before you</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.870" end="01:08:53.970" style="s2">you told your story this is what I call</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.089" end="01:08:56.670" style="s2">a protocol cooperative so what is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.970" end="01:08:59.640" style="s2">protocol cooperative you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.670" end="01:09:01.529" style="s2">creating joint patterns so that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.640" end="01:09:03.690" style="s2">whole ecosystem can organize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.529" end="01:09:06.989" style="s2">around this joint patterns if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.690" end="01:09:09.719" style="s2">remember occupy was like that right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.989" end="01:09:10.969" style="s2">occupy has had you know ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.719" end="01:09:13.799" style="s2">failed had weakness</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.969" end="01:09:17.369" style="s2">but it did succeed in very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.799" end="01:09:19.920" style="s2">mobilizing a huge number of people like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.369" end="01:09:22.259" style="s2">15m in in Spain was like 1 million</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.920" end="01:09:24.359" style="s2">people on the streets because they had a</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.259" end="01:09:27.500" style="s2">common protocol like if you do this and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.359" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">this and this you can call yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.500" end="01:09:33.060" style="s2">occupied and wiki houses the same if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:34.469" style="s2">do this and this and this you can call</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.060" end="01:09:37.080" style="s2">yourself wiki house and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.469" end="01:09:40.380" style="s2">also participate in the system and so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.080" end="01:09:43.409" style="s2">go from economics of scale which is what</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.380" end="01:09:45.560" style="s2">we do now which is by producing more of</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.409" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">a single unit you can make it cheaper</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.560" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">but it also means you&#39;re using more</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:53.279" style="s2">energy and resources in order to obtain</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:55.080" style="s2">that competitivity and you go to another</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:09:58.290" style="s2">model which is called the economies of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.080" end="01:10:01.050" style="s2">scope which is doing more with less so</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.290" end="01:10:03.869" style="s2">basically on the information level what</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.050" end="01:10:07.320" style="s2">happens is in a system like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.869" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">any innovation anywhere in the world can</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.320" end="01:10:12.360" style="s2">be copied very rapidly by anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:15.000" style="s2">in the ecosystem so you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.360" end="01:10:16.880" style="s2">ultimately the what&#39;s it&#39;s called open</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.000" end="01:10:20.730" style="s2">motors does that that you have you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.880" end="01:10:22.909" style="s2">designs for cars and if a local city</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.730" end="01:10:25.290" style="s2">decide we&#39;re gonna make our own buses</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.909" end="01:10:28.050" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily have to buy it</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.290" end="01:10:32.280" style="s2">from a big private company they can say</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.050" end="01:10:35.600" style="s2">we can make our local biodegradable you</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.280" end="01:10:38.040" style="s2">know renewable buses based on modular</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:40.139" style="s2">repairable systems we can make them</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.040" end="01:10:43.080" style="s2">right here and this is what I call</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.139" end="01:10:45.750" style="s2">Cozumel local production where</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.080" end="01:10:47.820" style="s2">everything that is lights is global and</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.750" end="01:10:51.600" style="s2">shared and everything that is heavy is</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.820" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">low like that a lot in fact I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.600" end="01:10:55.889" style="s2">point this one out the wiki has one to</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:10:57.540" style="s2">our game be community for people to dig</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.889" end="01:11:00.600" style="s2">into because there are groups getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.540" end="01:11:03.330" style="s2">ready to actually create communities</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.600" end="01:11:05.130" style="s2">physical ones and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.330" end="01:11:08.070" style="s2">people are talking about is what are</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.130" end="01:11:10.139" style="s2">economic and ethical ways to build good</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.070" end="01:11:12.119" style="s2">housing and it looks like this wiki</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.139" end="01:11:14.699" style="s2">house is quite an interesting concept</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.119" end="01:11:16.889" style="s2">yes I have a whole category of a housing</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.699" end="01:11:18.690" style="s2">you know category housing in my wikis so</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.889" end="01:11:20.849" style="s2">you&#39;ll see this there&#39;s a lot more and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.690" end="01:11:22.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s really what I want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.849" end="01:11:23.940" style="s2">push is that people have to know these</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.440" end="01:11:26.940" style="s2">nice seed forms so they</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.940" end="01:11:28.680" style="s2">learn from each other and we have a big</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.940" end="01:11:30.390" style="s2">problem which is fragmentation which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.680" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">that you know I went to Tuscany and</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.390" end="01:11:35.850" style="s2">there were 13 pieces of software to</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:38.070" style="s2">order organic food from CSAs</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.850" end="01:11:40.530" style="s2">community support agriculture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.070" end="01:11:42.840" style="s2">insane you know we have two mutual eyes</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.530" end="01:11:44.699" style="s2">our knowledge and in open sewers you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.840" end="01:11:47.430" style="s2">still adapt it to your local situation</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.699" end="01:11:49.020" style="s2">but you have this core commonality so</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.430" end="01:11:50.400" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.020" end="01:11:52.650" style="s2">because that&#39;s the problem when we</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.400" end="01:11:54.540" style="s2">compete with capitalism right if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.650" end="01:11:57.140" style="s2">can make an uber which is you know</p>

<p begin="01:12:06.330" end="01:12:12.540" style="s2">compete very good point though of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.540" end="01:12:14.670" style="s2">in a weird way you bir use your strategy</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.540" end="01:12:16.949" style="s2">they did that which is light and did it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.670" end="01:12:20.190" style="s2">globally the software and that which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.949" end="01:12:21.540" style="s2">heavy the car and made their drivers pay</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.190" end="01:12:24.900" style="s2">for the cars so they didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.540" end="01:12:27.540" style="s2">capital costs yeah brilliant and in hey</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.900" end="01:12:29.430" style="s2">that predatory about predatory you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.540" end="01:12:30.780" style="s2">unfortunately anything good can be used</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.430" end="01:12:32.940" style="s2">for bad which actually gives us a</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.780" end="01:12:34.620" style="s2">perfect transition to the the next topic</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.940" end="01:12:35.699" style="s2">and I guess it&#39;ll be probably the last</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.620" end="01:12:36.930" style="s2">topic because we&#39;re kind of getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.699" end="01:12:38.280" style="s2">short on time got a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.930" end="01:12:40.320" style="s2">interesting things to talk about in my</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.280" end="01:12:42.449" style="s2">notes maybe be interested in coming back</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.320" end="01:12:44.940" style="s2">for a part two I do this fairly often</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.449" end="01:12:47.100" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to because</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.940" end="01:12:49.980" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right there&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.100" end="01:12:51.540" style="s2">discuss and I think also for people you</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.980" end="01:12:55.560" style="s2">know it can be too long because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.540" end="01:12:57.630" style="s2">a lot to to digest actually ok let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.560" end="01:12:59.670" style="s2">on one on the last topic that we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.630" end="01:13:01.469" style="s2">time for and then we&#39;ll have you back</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.670" end="01:13:04.110" style="s2">for a part two to get into a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.469" end="01:13:05.400" style="s2">of other things and that is your that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.110" end="01:13:07.739" style="s2">you talked about quite a bit in Chapter</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.400" end="01:13:10.890" style="s2">three of the period of here book which</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.739" end="01:13:13.680" style="s2">is how are many too many communications</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.890" end="01:13:16.260" style="s2">and other things that we are creating in</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.680" end="01:13:18.870" style="s2">this internet world of ours provide us</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.260" end="01:13:21.180" style="s2">what you called new socio technological</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.870" end="01:13:22.620" style="s2">frameworks why don&#39;t we talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.180" end="01:13:24.090" style="s2">a little bit then I&#39;ll probably follow</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.620" end="01:13:27.989" style="s2">up on that because that&#39;s the area I did</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.090" end="01:13:30.690" style="s2">most of my business career in right well</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.989" end="01:13:32.190" style="s2">so last year produced also another</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.690" end="01:13:33.960" style="s2">report I want to briefly mention it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.190" end="01:13:35.230" style="s2">called p2p accounting for planet to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.960" end="01:13:37.720" style="s2">survival</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.230" end="01:13:40.510" style="s2">so I proposed a kind of unified global</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.720" end="01:13:43.690" style="s2">infrastructure to produce for human</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.510" end="01:13:46.120" style="s2">needs within planetary boundaries and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.690" end="01:13:47.230" style="s2">have one slide that maybe we can talk</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.120" end="01:13:49.630" style="s2">about it next time I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.230" end="01:13:52.840" style="s2">mention it because people believe</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.630" end="01:13:54.460" style="s2">technology is neutral that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.840" end="01:13:55.660" style="s2">can make some invent something and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.460" end="01:13:58.450" style="s2">depends how you use it</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.660" end="01:14:01.090" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking this is not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.450" end="01:14:03.310" style="s2">true because the way you design</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.090" end="01:14:05.140" style="s2">something is already value driven and</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.310" end="01:14:07.540" style="s2">you can see that with the internet right</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.140" end="01:14:09.370" style="s2">it starts in the army where the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.540" end="01:14:10.270" style="s2">noncommissioned officers are telling</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.370" end="01:14:11.950" style="s2">their officers</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.270" end="01:14:14.260" style="s2">we need a distributed system because</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.950" end="01:14:16.360" style="s2">when you know when when the headquarters</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.260" end="01:14:18.130" style="s2">will be bombed in the world and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.360" end="01:14:21.700" style="s2">do anything anymore</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.130" end="01:14:23.980" style="s2">so DARPA develops this idea and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.700" end="01:14:26.500" style="s2">scientists start cheating and you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.980" end="01:14:27.880" style="s2">introducing the Internet in their</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.500" end="01:14:31.000" style="s2">offices you know there&#39;s a story about</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.880" end="01:14:33.280" style="s2">actually making a cable you know without</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.000" end="01:14:36.820" style="s2">permission so the scientists take it</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.280" end="01:14:38.650" style="s2">over and then the students and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.820" end="01:14:41.050" style="s2">researchers in the academia right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.650" end="01:14:44.110" style="s2">then you have the browser and then the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.050" end="01:14:45.670" style="s2">people come in and once the people are</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.110" end="01:14:47.290" style="s2">there the businesses then come in and</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.670" end="01:14:49.870" style="s2">they change the internet into organic</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.290" end="01:14:51.520" style="s2">client-server logic they go away from</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.870" end="01:14:53.710" style="s2">the peer to peer because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.520" end="01:14:55.270" style="s2">control it and then the third wave is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.710" end="01:14:56.980" style="s2">government see that happening so oh my</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.270" end="01:14:59.680" style="s2">god we need to control this and they you</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.980" end="01:15:01.590" style="s2">know then surveillance is introduced so</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.680" end="01:15:03.430" style="s2">I just want to say that design</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.590" end="01:15:08.560" style="s2">technology is not neutral</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.430" end="01:15:11.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a based on values and on values and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:17.290" style="s2">design decisions and so you apply that</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.830" end="01:15:18.940" style="s2">to peer to peer and what I described in</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.290" end="01:15:20.830" style="s2">chapter 3 is that there are now four</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.940" end="01:15:23.500" style="s2">competing models because peer to peer is</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.830" end="01:15:25.530" style="s2">here to stay it&#39;s kind of the basic</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.500" end="01:15:29.830" style="s2">paradigm but then how you implement it</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.530" end="01:15:34.540" style="s2">is based on values interests etc so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.830" end="01:15:37.720" style="s2">have a quadrant with centralized and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.540" end="01:15:39.610" style="s2">global versus local and distributed and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.720" end="01:15:43.620" style="s2">you have another line your result a line</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.610" end="01:15:47.590" style="s2">between for profit and for benefit so</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.620" end="01:15:49.030" style="s2">centralized for profit peer-to-peer what</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.590" end="01:15:52.539" style="s2">does that mean well that&#39;s Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.030" end="01:15:55.960" style="s2">uber and Google so they allow us to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.539" end="01:15:57.460" style="s2">peer-to-peer on their platforms but</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.960" end="01:16:01.030" style="s2">everything in the background is</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.460" end="01:16:04.360" style="s2">privatized and so our data becomes a new</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.030" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">oil and they sell our attention so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.360" end="01:16:09.579" style="s2">call this net article capitalism because</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.880" end="01:16:11.409" style="s2">it&#39;s the hierarchy of the network but</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.579" end="01:16:13.659" style="s2">you know they still they still enable a</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.409" end="01:16:17.079" style="s2">lot of peer-to-peer you know even though</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.659" end="01:16:19.090" style="s2">we might criticize them and I do but you</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.079" end="01:16:20.440" style="s2">know for example Facebook in Austin in</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.090" end="01:16:23.199" style="s2">Belgium because I&#39;m originally from</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.440" end="01:16:26.380" style="s2">there you know there&#39;s a community</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.199" end="01:16:28.869" style="s2">fishing project where the consumers</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.380" end="01:16:30.940" style="s2">ordered the fish directly from the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.869" end="01:16:32.980" style="s2">fishermen and then pick them up when</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.940" end="01:16:35.320" style="s2">they come from back from the sea yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.980" end="01:16:37.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a very positive communities for</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.320" end="01:16:40.980" style="s2">the fisheries that is actually managed</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.210" end="01:16:43.329" style="s2">to true Facebook right then the second</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.980" end="01:16:45.670" style="s2">distributed for profit is basically what</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.329" end="01:16:47.889" style="s2">I call the blockchain world so they use</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.670" end="01:16:49.989" style="s2">things like proof of work and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.889" end="01:16:51.909" style="s2">other name proof of stake they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.989" end="01:16:53.650" style="s2">oligarchic protocols I&#39;m sorry these are</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.909" end="01:16:56.289" style="s2">protocols which give more to the people</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.650" end="01:16:57.880" style="s2">who already have more so you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.289" end="01:17:02.320" style="s2">distribution of Bitcoin it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.880" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">unequal than sovereign right on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.320" end="01:17:05.920" style="s2">other hand these people are doing you</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:08.590" style="s2">know great innovations they&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.920" end="01:17:11.619" style="s2">open collaborative systems they reserve</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.590" end="01:17:13.329" style="s2">40% of the tokens for the workers you</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.619" end="01:17:16.270" style="s2">know there&#39;s some really interested</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.329" end="01:17:18.309" style="s2">interesting stuff happening there and</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.270" end="01:17:19.570" style="s2">now we&#39;re moving to post blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.309" end="01:17:21.280" style="s2">Ledger&#39;s so that&#39;s I think very</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.570" end="01:17:23.409" style="s2">interesting then on the on the other</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.280" end="01:17:25.570" style="s2">side of this gradient you have two other</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.409" end="01:17:28.570" style="s2">modes one is what I call urban common so</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.570" end="01:17:32.739" style="s2">local projects small open locally</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.570" end="01:17:34.510" style="s2">connected SLOC and there&#39;s you know this</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.739" end="01:17:36.940" style="s2">is what I think I told you that for</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.510" end="01:17:40.179" style="s2">example in Ghent in Belgium we went from</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.940" end="01:17:41.559" style="s2">50 urban Commons to 500 in ten years so</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.179" end="01:17:44.770" style="s2">this is also happening and then the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.559" end="01:17:46.630" style="s2">global Commons ID is the last one for</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.770" end="01:17:48.159" style="s2">example I think that cities should</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.630" end="01:17:51.699" style="s2">create leagues like in the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.159" end="01:17:53.500" style="s2">and create protocol coops for every</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.699" end="01:17:56.190" style="s2">provisioning system that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.500" end="01:18:00.489" style="s2">visualized in the city so shared habitat</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.190" end="01:18:03.250" style="s2">mobility shared food and it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.489" end="01:18:05.080" style="s2">horrendous that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.250" end="01:18:06.790" style="s2">should happen independently in every</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.080" end="01:18:10.390" style="s2">city when they could actually create a</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.790" end="01:18:12.340" style="s2">core of patterns that could be used by</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.390" end="01:18:14.440" style="s2">all the petition so this is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.340" end="01:18:18.130" style="s2">actually deceive a form of trans local</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.440" end="01:18:20.740" style="s2">the transnational governance where the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.130" end="01:18:23.110" style="s2">city becomes the tool of global</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.740" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">governance right in alliance with</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.110" end="01:18:27.580" style="s2">ethical finds and coops and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:30.190" style="s2">anyone lies with these communities that</p>

<p begin="01:18:32.890" end="01:18:37.630" style="s2">I hope that&#39;s a bit clear so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.660" end="01:18:39.310" style="s2">saying is they are developing all four</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.630" end="01:18:40.410" style="s2">at the same time in competing with each</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.310" end="01:18:45.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.410" end="01:18:49.480" style="s2">and right now of course the new tactical</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.400" end="01:18:51.700" style="s2">side is winning and dominant but they</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.480" end="01:18:52.930" style="s2">are actually very predatory system so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.700" end="01:18:54.430" style="s2">don&#39;t think they are a lot they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.930" end="01:18:58.180" style="s2">sustainable in the long term right</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.430" end="01:18:59.220" style="s2">Airbnb destroys the inner city it chases</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.180" end="01:19:02.950" style="s2">people away</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.220" end="01:19:04.570" style="s2">uber produces more pollution rather than</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.950" end="01:19:05.680" style="s2">less so there are fundamental issues</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.570" end="01:19:08.140" style="s2">with these models which are</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.680" end="01:19:10.750" style="s2">fundamentally predatory and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.140" end="01:19:13.300" style="s2">pay taxes and they don&#39;t invest in</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.750" end="01:19:15.460" style="s2">infrastructure use you know for socially</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.300" end="01:19:18.820" style="s2">paid for by their own workers so these</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.460" end="01:19:21.430" style="s2">are very problematic models absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.820" end="01:19:24.040" style="s2">it is interesting that there are a few</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.430" end="01:19:26.320" style="s2">upstarts against uber I know in Austin</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.040" end="01:19:29.230" style="s2">Texas there&#39;s a local I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.320" end="01:19:31.660" style="s2">driver own co-op that has almost 50</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.230" end="01:19:35.590" style="s2">percent of the market but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.660" end="01:19:38.950" style="s2">talk of all these csa software platforms</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.590" end="01:19:41.980" style="s2">there somehow need to be a global level</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.950" end="01:19:44.170" style="s2">of standardization templates or seeds as</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.980" end="01:19:46.810" style="s2">you call them or we call them the game</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.170" end="01:19:50.470" style="s2">be world X in a box essentially a</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.810" end="01:19:53.830" style="s2">turnkey how can anyone anywhere set up a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.470" end="01:19:56.110" style="s2">goober coop essentially and that seems</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.830" end="01:19:57.970" style="s2">to be how at least one way that we could</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.110" end="01:20:01.030" style="s2">nip away at these kind of over</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.970" end="01:20:03.010" style="s2">concentrated network predators yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.030" end="01:20:05.230" style="s2">I I completely so we have to start with</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.010" end="01:20:06.670" style="s2">seeds you know then become niches and</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.230" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">then add some more when Tunisia&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.670" end="01:20:11.470" style="s2">become the norm and we know this can</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:13.930" style="s2">happen because you think about Germany</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.470" end="01:20:16.090" style="s2">and renewable energy right so you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.930" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">this one village co-op for maybe 20</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.090" end="01:20:21.100" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.960" end="01:20:23.650" style="s2">and they have to fight for five years to</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.100" end="01:20:26.830" style="s2">have the legal right to form renewable</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.650" end="01:20:29.020" style="s2">energy co-op so once it&#39;s accepted by</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.830" end="01:20:31.000" style="s2">the legal system it starts proliferating</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.020" end="01:20:34.060" style="s2">but it never goes more than a two three</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.000" end="01:20:35.890" style="s2">percent of energy production but then</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.060" end="01:20:37.090" style="s2">you have Fukushima and the Greens are in</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.890" end="01:20:39.700" style="s2">the government that they made a deal</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.090" end="01:20:41.980" style="s2">with Merkel and then they introduced a</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.700" end="01:20:46.719" style="s2">feed-in tariffs and within five to seven</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.980" end="01:20:49.650" style="s2">years 62% of the energy market is you</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.719" end="01:20:53.680" style="s2">know done by these village coops so</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.650" end="01:20:54.420" style="s2">that&#39;s in that niche they have one you</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.680" end="01:20:58.090" style="s2">know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.420" end="01:21:00.010" style="s2">it&#39;s of course it&#39;s good enough but if</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.090" end="01:21:02.860" style="s2">you think of the emergence of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.010" end="01:21:06.040" style="s2">you know it took a very long time for</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.860" end="01:21:08.680" style="s2">them to become the law now we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.040" end="01:21:09.850" style="s2">eight centuries that&#39;s for sure so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.680" end="01:21:15.010" style="s2">gonna have to be you know working</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.850" end="01:21:16.180" style="s2">accelerated ways but also the I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.010" end="01:21:18.310" style="s2">find a reference to this but so many</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.180" end="01:21:20.290" style="s2">told me is that we are learning eight</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.310" end="01:21:24.430" style="s2">times faster than like 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.290" end="01:21:25.630" style="s2">right so the the the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.430" end="01:21:28.390" style="s2">the internet needs collective</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.630" end="01:21:31.390" style="s2">intelligence means that innovations are</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.390" end="01:21:33.580" style="s2">now moving so rapidly think about</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.390" end="01:21:35.890" style="s2">permaculture that went from nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.580" end="01:21:38.710" style="s2">my with thousands and thousands upon</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.890" end="01:21:40.300" style="s2">thousands of projects also of course in</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.710" end="01:21:42.610" style="s2">a bad way I read another article about</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.300" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">bombs that you can make you know side on</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.610" end="01:21:47.080" style="s2">the side ways like in Afghanistan they</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.320" end="01:21:48.520" style="s2">took them six months to make to learn</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.080" end="01:21:50.830" style="s2">about this and now it&#39;s like two weeks</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.520" end="01:21:52.989" style="s2">so this is at the same time I hope</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.830" end="01:21:55.420" style="s2">because even though we can do bad things</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.989" end="01:21:57.610" style="s2">with it it means that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.420" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">gonna accelerate it decline we also have</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.610" end="01:22:02.950" style="s2">to learn much more rapidly what the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:06.190" style="s2">alternatives are so this is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.950" end="01:22:09.219" style="s2">in some way again a race against time</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.190" end="01:22:10.210" style="s2">and can I tell you one more thing Jim</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.219" end="01:22:12.850" style="s2">before we end this</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.210" end="01:22:14.290" style="s2">so Peter Pagani has a book called</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.850" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">rethinking in the world and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.290" end="01:22:18.790" style="s2">very important so he says okay Society</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:19.989" style="s2">is a complex adaptive system so it</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.790" end="01:22:22.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change because good people</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.989" end="01:22:25.680" style="s2">decide to do things differently it</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.900" end="01:22:27.850" style="s2">changes because a system breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.680" end="01:22:30.760" style="s2">creates a chaotic transition with the</p>

<p begin="01:23:45.219" end="01:23:49.090" style="s2">talked about earlier but within the</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.170" end="01:23:58.090" style="s2">exactly exactly and I noticed that you</p>
