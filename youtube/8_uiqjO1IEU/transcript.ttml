<p begin="00:00:01.800" end="00:00:05.700" style="s2">portal but I thought I&#39;d say a few words</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.210" end="00:00:07.710" style="s2">before this episode in general when we</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:09.990" style="s2">present science in front of the public</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.710" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">we do it in one of two ways either we</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.990" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">talk in an incredibly hand-wavy way</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:17.480" style="s2">about very speculative ideas like string</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">theory or we have a sort of a corpse of</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.480" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">previous scientific thought that has</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">been specifically arranged for public</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:26.550" style="s2">viewing it&#39;s not really science the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">we do science it&#39;s kind of a denatured</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.550" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">version to make sure that we don&#39;t lose</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:32.369" style="s2">anybody because the public is famously</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">supposed to be squeamish about anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.369" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">involving equations abstractions or</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">jargon in this episode we try to well do</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">something different I&#39;m actually having</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">a conversation with Garrett here he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.440" style="s2">updating me on where his thinking has</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">gone with respect to unifying physics</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.440" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">now it&#39;s very unusual for anyone to try</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">to unify physics and I have a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">amount of respect for Garrett even</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">though I don&#39;t think his theories are</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">going to work I make no secret of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying anything behind his back</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">but he is in some sense Theodore</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">Roosevelt&#39;s man in the arena he actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">is trying to take on the general problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">of the cosmos and even though I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">think he&#39;s succeeding he has my profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">admiration for simply suiting up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">trying most people in fact almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.780" style="s2">everyone I know does not attempt to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">what he is doing and for that he has my</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.780" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">admiration and respect</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">now with that admiration respect comes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">desire not to be mean but to actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">push him on his theory because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">want to see him wasting his time and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">feel that when you&#39;re outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">university system there&#39;s almost no one</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">who takes your research seriously so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">while there is an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek with respect to us being</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">actually something quite serious about</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">it I don&#39;t necessarily like the path</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">that he&#39;s going down and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">that I really believe that he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">get anywhere productive but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">that he&#39;s an inspiration to us all</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">simply for trying in an era where</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">everyone else seems to have given up I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">hope you enjoy this episode and I hope</p>

<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">listen in on something which is much</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.430" end="00:02:47.880" style="s2">is about what what could you do to</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">might be all right well we have a many</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">disturbing similarities in that we did</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">fairly well in school we got our PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">but then we left academia and but</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">maintained an interest in fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">physics and kept pursuing this on our</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:14.490" style="s2">own however there are some distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">and that you went into the finance world</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.490" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">and I went into being a surf bum yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">that&#39;s not that similar also you are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:28.190" style="s2">have a PhD in physics proper whereas I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:31.140" style="s2">have one in mathematics so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.190" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">advantage Lisi but then I have one from</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">a more typically powerhouse school you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">have one from one that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:43.050" style="s2">off of that main corridor that maybe got</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">up caught up in string theory and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.050" end="00:03:49.650" style="s2">the fads that propel the field but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.190" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">think what&#39;s been very interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.650" end="00:03:56.040" style="s2">is that in all of theoretical physics</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:57.660" style="s2">which everyone is quite interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.040" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">you still find people publishing books</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.660" end="00:04:02.760" style="s2">on quantum theory and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:07.020" style="s2">spookiness weirdness and beauty that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.760" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">constitutes theoretical physics it feels</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.020" end="00:04:11.520" style="s2">to me that almost no one is pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:13.020" style="s2">actual theories of everything when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.520" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">talk about theories of everything all</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.020" end="00:04:18.359" style="s2">the time but that the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">actually put forward anything that even</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.359" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">remotely resembles a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">everything almost nobody is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">do that would you say that that&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">statement yeah it&#39;s a very fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">and the the main reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a hard problem that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">you pretty much have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.100" style="s2">megalomaniac just to tackle it or to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">think you have a chance of succeeding at</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.100" end="00:04:42.330" style="s2">it well I think that&#39;s a weird statement</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">like if you&#39;re doing if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.330" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">throw away your life on issues of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:48.390" style="s2">theoretical physics what is it that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:50.010" style="s2">would imagine people would think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.390" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">they were doing like if you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.010" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">for the brass ring why into that field</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">well I think that a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">physics are doing the usual thing where</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">they encounter a problem and try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">solve it and try to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">incrementally and that&#39;s how actually I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">got wrapped up in this is I identified a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">problem with electrons in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">description in in fundamental physics it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:14.820" style="s2">was something about it that really I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:15.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t like it just didn&#39;t just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.820" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">feel right to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.480" end="00:05:20.790" style="s2">and I got wrapped up in solving that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">know one aspect of this big picture I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.790" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t go off trying to sink oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:25.100" style="s2">really gonna tackle this problem of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">coming up with a theory of everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:30.390" style="s2">because you you you have to be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:33.540" style="s2">of a lunatic to take that on it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.390" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">you know I trying to prove some theorem</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.540" end="00:05:37.830" style="s2">and mathematics it has been stagnant for</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">hundreds of years it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.830" end="00:05:40.890" style="s2">you&#39;re probably not going to succeed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:42.540" style="s2">you&#39;d probably just be frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.890" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">the attempt you have to have huge ego to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.540" end="00:05:47.130" style="s2">even think about it right and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of discouragement our</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.130" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">students are actively discouraged from</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:53.730" style="s2">tackling such problems because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:55.290" style="s2">professors who came before them and know</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.730" end="00:05:56.730" style="s2">a little bit more about the field know</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.730" end="00:06:00.420" style="s2">even on small problems and that making</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.070" end="00:06:02.310" style="s2">progress on a huge one is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.420" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">insurmountable so they tried to actively</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.780" style="s2">this up and I should say to regular</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.920" end="00:06:29.670" style="s2">other other people have shows and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.480" end="00:06:31.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a concept of professionalism I</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">untested we&#39;re going to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.990" end="00:06:41.169" style="s2">our advertising models we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.870" end="00:06:54.189" style="s2">in fact the host may get left behind we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.909" end="00:06:56.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know but no it&#39;s quite possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.189" end="00:06:58.930" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.889" end="00:07:01.419" style="s2">series of interviews to begin the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.930" end="00:07:03.550" style="s2">podcast to just establish that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.419" end="00:07:06.099" style="s2">have conversations that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:08.349" style="s2">tune into and get great guests in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.099" end="00:07:09.939" style="s2">chair where people may not have even</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.349" end="00:07:12.669" style="s2">heard of the person before but hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.939" end="00:07:14.110" style="s2">walk away feeling enriched however</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.669" end="00:07:16.659" style="s2">that&#39;s not really the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.110" end="00:07:19.569" style="s2">podcast the point of the podcast is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.659" end="00:07:22.330" style="s2">explore new territory intellectually and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.569" end="00:07:24.729" style="s2">it may be an academic level outside of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.330" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">traditional channels and it has to do in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.729" end="00:07:32.349" style="s2">part with my belief that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:35.110" style="s2">understand how much idea suppression has</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.349" end="00:07:37.509" style="s2">been going on for a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">time within the standard institutions in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.509" end="00:07:41.349" style="s2">fact I&#39;ve I&#39;ve created this thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:44.289" style="s2">called the disc the distributed ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.349" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">suppression complex and its purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.289" end="00:07:51.339" style="s2">to make sure that ideas do not suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:53.889" style="s2">catch fire and up end and disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.339" end="00:07:56.710" style="s2">previous structures so for example I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.889" end="00:07:59.469" style="s2">would claim that string theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.710" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">absolutely dominated theoretical physics</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.469" end="00:08:08.129" style="s2">since what 1984 yeah since about then</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:11.589" style="s2">it&#39;s about 35 years it artificially</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.129" end="00:08:15.639" style="s2">consolidated the field around a complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.589" end="00:08:19.150" style="s2">of ideas that did not have a huge signal</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.639" end="00:08:21.069" style="s2">coming from experiment you know to just</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.150" end="00:08:22.389" style="s2">to try steel home base I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.069" end="00:08:25.389" style="s2">understand that you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.389" end="00:08:28.599" style="s2">the as I&#39;m sure you do the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.389" end="00:08:30.759" style="s2">of particle physics at the time when</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.599" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">string theory started to grow which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.759" end="00:08:37.630" style="s2">you know up until you know up to the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">there had been steady experimental</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.630" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">results coming in from particle</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">accelerators where it was like a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">particle every week that theorists</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:48.550" style="s2">rafting to really cooperate on as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:08:50.199" style="s2">community to jump in on and try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.550" end="00:08:52.270" style="s2">figure it out and exchange ideas very it</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.199" end="00:08:53.650" style="s2">was more than 50s and 6th it was but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.270" end="00:08:58.600" style="s2">continued all the way through the seven</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.650" end="00:09:01.260" style="s2">and and from that culture of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.600" end="00:09:03.010" style="s2">community working together on</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.260" end="00:09:05.620" style="s2">information that&#39;s coming in a steady</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.010" end="00:09:07.000" style="s2">stream right you got this culture of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.620" end="00:09:08.620" style="s2">like yeah no don&#39;t go do that other</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.000" end="00:09:10.930" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a waste of time you really</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.620" end="00:09:12.040" style="s2">want to be working on what&#39;s hot right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.930" end="00:09:13.720" style="s2">because there&#39;s new information coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.040" end="00:09:16.510" style="s2">in all the time and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">culture of string theory started I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.510" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">also more involved in the in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:22.330" style="s2">of John relativity and gravity okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:24.460" style="s2">which is a very different culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.330" end="00:09:25.390" style="s2">much more slow-paced you don&#39;t have new</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.460" end="00:09:28.540" style="s2">results coming in all the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.390" end="00:09:29.980" style="s2">everything&#39;s very is much more do I set</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:32.610" style="s2">this up a little bit for our audience</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.980" end="00:09:36.850" style="s2">and you charity if I do a poor job in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.610" end="00:09:39.130" style="s2">essence the - great idea complexes in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.850" end="00:09:41.620" style="s2">fundamental physics not condensed matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.130" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2">physics or astrophysics but like</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.620" end="00:09:47.770" style="s2">whatever ground reality physics is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">the general relativistic complex around</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.770" end="00:09:52.020" style="s2">the ideas of Einstein and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.280" style="s2">the sort of quantum field theory a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.020" end="00:09:56.710" style="s2">complex or the quantum complex around</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.280" end="00:09:58.600" style="s2">the ideas of Bohr sort of fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.710" end="00:10:01.240" style="s2">and plunk ona I don&#39;t mean to slight</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.600" end="00:10:03.010" style="s2">Dirac and others but just to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.240" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">simple the children of Einstein and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.010" end="00:10:08.580" style="s2">children of Bohr right and that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:10.360" style="s2">boring people went into particle physics</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.580" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">the boring people</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.360" end="00:10:14.650" style="s2">well you said they&#39;re the children of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:16.210" style="s2">Bohr&#39;s ha ha ha ha okay so so they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.650" end="00:10:18.580" style="s2">they&#39;re in this culture that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.210" end="00:10:20.290" style="s2">rapid fire you know moving moving things</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.580" end="00:10:22.840" style="s2">along as part of a community whereas</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.290" end="00:10:25.330" style="s2">genre relativity the people from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.840" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">Einstein community were more exploring</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.330" end="00:10:28.180" style="s2">different possibilities at their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.220" style="s2">pace and there is more of an exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.180" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">culture and that&#39;s the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.220" end="00:10:35.950" style="s2">turned into loop quantum gravity so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.980" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">so first of all I&#39;m just gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.950" end="00:10:40.900" style="s2">begin arguing with you there to me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">the issue was is that Einstein put much</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.900" end="00:10:49.060" style="s2">more of the general relativistic picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:52.180" style="s2">in place so there was less to do for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.060" end="00:10:56.760" style="s2">descendants of Einstein and because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.180" end="00:10:59.500" style="s2">quantum was considerably less tied up</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.760" end="00:11:02.020" style="s2">there was much more work and so through</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.500" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">a system of selective pressures the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.020" end="00:11:06.520" style="s2">successful community in some sense left</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">fewer descendants and they were less</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.520" end="00:11:08.380" style="s2">capable</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">because there was less for them to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.380" end="00:11:14.680" style="s2">and then you had the quantum communities</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:16.420" style="s2">start to attract the real brains because</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.680" end="00:11:18.279" style="s2">there was lots of work for a period of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.420" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">time to go back and forth between theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.279" end="00:11:26.770" style="s2">and experiment that&#39;s right okay and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">but what happened was that when they</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.770" end="00:11:33.370" style="s2">when you think about it as a whole that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:35.110" style="s2">gravity has to be quantized so there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.370" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">two ways of getting there you can either</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.110" end="00:11:40.960" style="s2">start from Bohr&#39;s children and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:42.100" style="s2">quantum field theory and try to get from</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.960" end="00:11:44.410" style="s2">there to a quantum theory that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.100" end="00:11:46.300" style="s2">encompasses gravity or you can start</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.410" end="00:11:49.570" style="s2">from the gravitational side in geometry</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.300" end="00:11:51.490" style="s2">and try to somehow get quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.570" end="00:11:54.100" style="s2">to play nice with this essentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.490" end="00:11:55.330" style="s2">classical geometric theory and there</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.100" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">were two very different approaches and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.330" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">two very different cultures I still have</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">some disagreements but I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:07.300" style="s2">necessarily want to to derail us so all</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:09.400" style="s2">right so so anyway my the the point I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.300" end="00:12:11.650" style="s2">started with was that the the string</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.400" end="00:12:13.420" style="s2">theory came out of the particle physics</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.650" end="00:12:16.779" style="s2">community and when we say string theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.420" end="00:12:19.290" style="s2">we mean the cultural explosion that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.779" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">happened in 1984 rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.290" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">original string revolution of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:29.170" style="s2">vinet Siana which was much earlier okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">so that in in the mid-1980s there was a</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">could go in that spot and that result</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.220" end="00:12:55.570" style="s2">the anomaly cancellation gave birth to a</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.810" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">I mean it looks so promising at the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:05.529" style="s2">in the 80s I mean they thought that yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">it naturally encompasses gravity and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.529" end="00:13:09.910" style="s2">we need to do is find the right you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:12.220" style="s2">high dimensional manifold to attach to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.910" end="00:13:13.990" style="s2">for our strings to vibrate in and will</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:17.589" style="s2">we just have to find the right one</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably get this done by</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.589" end="00:13:20.830" style="s2">lunchtime wrapped up I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">that story</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.830" end="00:13:24.850" style="s2">well they didn&#39;t happen that was known I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:28.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s a even what actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.850" end="00:13:30.459" style="s2">happened in IRAs in college in it during</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.120" end="00:13:33.130" style="s2">this period and even though that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.459" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">story that I would agree is told inside</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.130" end="00:13:36.610" style="s2">of the community yeah I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:38.200" style="s2">I fully believe it if I go back to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.610" end="00:13:39.700" style="s2">own memories something very different</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.200" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">happened well it took a while to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.700" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">everybody on the bandwagon I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.170" end="00:13:45.070" style="s2">something&#39;s still different happened I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:47.110" style="s2">think that Ed Witten showed up and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.070" end="00:13:50.050" style="s2">there was one human being he&#39;s his own</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:53.170" style="s2">anomaly he wasn&#39;t he was absolutely an</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.050" end="00:13:58.510" style="s2">anomaly he came to Penn in I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.170" end="00:14:02.829" style="s2">whether it was 83 or 84 I left in 85 and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.510" end="00:14:06.610" style="s2">he started talking about what the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.829" end="00:14:08.620" style="s2">was in a way that none of the physicists</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.610" end="00:14:10.870" style="s2">could actually follow because he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.620" end="00:14:13.899" style="s2">using ideas from from differential</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.870" end="00:14:16.570" style="s2">geometry and from higher mathematics in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.899" end="00:14:18.760" style="s2">ways that most of the community couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.570" end="00:14:22.269" style="s2">track he was saying things like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.760" end="00:14:25.060" style="s2">reason we have three copies of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.269" end="00:14:30.100" style="s2">of matter that makes up our world comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.060" end="00:14:32.470" style="s2">from the characteristic numbers of a six</p>

<p begin="00:14:32.470" end="00:14:36.730" style="s2">every point in space and time and these</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.630" end="00:14:38.829" style="s2">things were so mind-blowing I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.730" end="00:14:41.470" style="s2">our listeners can&#39;t exactly follow it</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.829" end="00:14:43.240" style="s2">they were in the same shoes as many</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.470" end="00:14:45.070" style="s2">people in the community there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.240" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">voice that was clearly coming from</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.070" end="00:14:49.420" style="s2">another planet</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">all right undoubtedly the most brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.420" end="00:14:52.570" style="s2">person I&#39;ve ever met in my life</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">the one person who continues to make me</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.570" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">tremble when I hear his name or his</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:15:02.310" style="s2">voice and this person signed on big-time</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:04.990" style="s2">to string theory in a way that was very</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.310" end="00:15:06.850" style="s2">coercive and seductive so they even</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.990" end="00:15:09.490" style="s2">though that the community understood why</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.850" end="00:15:12.459" style="s2">he was signing on it was in part</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.490" end="00:15:14.980" style="s2">Witten&#39;s endorsement that really started</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.459" end="00:15:18.250" style="s2">to move the needle in my opinion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.980" end="00:15:23.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s stunning just to what</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.250" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">degree that failed okay so say more well</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.260" end="00:15:28.089" style="s2">the the strength reunification program</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.589" end="00:15:51.930" style="s2">failed to deliver on that promise</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.930" end="00:15:57.960" style="s2">and this has to do and again we can sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.770" end="00:16:00.810" style="s2">of do a small synopsis of the field the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.960" end="00:16:04.140" style="s2">idea was the original hopes had been</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.810" end="00:16:07.500" style="s2">built around an idealized point particle</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.450" end="00:16:14.760" style="s2">then he had to smear them out and do</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.760" end="00:16:19.380" style="s2">concept called second quantization or</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.259" end="00:19:08.529" style="s2">engaged with I think there are three</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.999" end="00:19:12.070" style="s2">components to it and just see whether</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.529" end="00:19:14.669" style="s2">whether it resonates with you one is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.070" end="00:19:17.859" style="s2">that this is the closest we get</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.669" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">responsibly to asking why are we here</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.859" end="00:19:22.509" style="s2">what is it that we&#39;re made of it is the</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.509" end="00:19:27.940" style="s2">religion if you were able to understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.879" end="00:19:31.359" style="s2">what it was the second thing is that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.940" end="00:19:33.669" style="s2">appears to be the secret powering our</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.359" end="00:19:37.119" style="s2">economy that very few people have really</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.669" end="00:19:41.019" style="s2">fully understood it gave us the</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.009" end="00:19:57.669" style="s2">you if you want it invented the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.299" end="00:20:00.520" style="s2">theoretical physics more or less created</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.520" end="00:20:04.900" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a bit of a stretch but</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.290" end="00:20:06.850" style="s2">the other certainly aren&#39;t so yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.900" end="00:20:09.309" style="s2">you look at the RNA tie club you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.850" end="00:20:15.010" style="s2">the people and that word teller Fineman</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.309" end="00:20:18.309" style="s2">Creek people trained in physics so in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.010" end="00:20:21.130" style="s2">this telling of the tale its second</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.309" end="00:20:23.530" style="s2">major feature of importance is that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.130" end="00:20:24.820" style="s2">sort of created our modern economy and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.530" end="00:20:26.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think people have understood the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:29.410" style="s2">extent to which all of these things for</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.650" end="00:20:31.270" style="s2">you know the Webb semiconductors and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.410" end="00:20:33.370" style="s2">even molecular biology really came out</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.270" end="00:20:36.309" style="s2">of theoretical physics because of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.370" end="00:20:37.900" style="s2">third issue which is I think even though</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.309" end="00:20:40.690" style="s2">I&#39;m a mathematician or trained in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.900" end="00:20:44.260" style="s2">mathematics I could make a pretty decent</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.690" end="00:20:47.429" style="s2">argument that this was the world&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.260" end="00:20:50.140" style="s2">impressive intellectual community ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.429" end="00:20:52.510" style="s2">it certainly it seems to attract some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.140" end="00:20:54.010" style="s2">the greatest minds well I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.510" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">would go even farther I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.010" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">because of the interplay between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.630" style="s2">most beautiful mathematics even</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.800" style="s2">according to mathematical standards and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.630" end="00:21:04.809" style="s2">experimental discipline so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.800" end="00:21:08.140" style="s2">this thing that&#39;s forcing you to go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.809" end="00:21:11.380" style="s2">and forth between the purest of pure</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.140" end="00:21:14.380" style="s2">theory and the the dirt and intuition</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.380" end="00:21:16.150" style="s2">and messiness of experiment I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.380" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">think anything else had that property so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.150" end="00:21:20.710" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t necessarily even that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:23.920" style="s2">just attracted the best people but it it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.710" end="00:21:25.750" style="s2">actually rewarded human intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.920" end="00:21:27.700" style="s2">achievement at like no other subject</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.750" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">ever all right it&#39;s also on touching on</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.700" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">something that&#39;s a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:38.590" style="s2">socially which is the type of people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:40.630" style="s2">are attracted to really you know hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.590" end="00:21:42.309" style="s2">problems in fundamental physics and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.630" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">modeling and really trying to get as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.309" end="00:21:48.340" style="s2">say the source code of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:51.160" style="s2">these often aren&#39;t very skilled people</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.340" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">people they&#39;re not very socially</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.160" end="00:21:55.720" style="s2">oriented people for the most part some</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:58.120" style="s2">are some aren&#39;t yeah but for for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.720" end="00:22:00.250" style="s2">real intellectual heavy hitters you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.120" end="00:22:02.260" style="s2">talking about people who sort of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.250" end="00:22:03.340" style="s2">walk among us as aliens you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.260" end="00:22:04.990" style="s2">about they know that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.340" end="00:22:07.480" style="s2">extremely social they&#39;re not very</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:20.919" style="s2">really otherworldly pursuit right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.580" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">not like law where laws are made up by</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.919" end="00:22:24.639" style="s2">humans and discussed in front of humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:26.259" style="s2">compat in front of humans it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.639" end="00:22:28.840" style="s2">that has its own intricacies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.259" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">difficulties and puzzles but theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.840" end="00:22:34.299" style="s2">physics you&#39;re getting you&#39;re working at</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">something that&#39;s not related to humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.299" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">directly I mean any intelligent beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.539" style="s2">in this universe that advance to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:45.279" style="s2">certain state are gonna be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.539" end="00:22:48.490" style="s2">studying physics and it&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.279" end="00:22:50.110" style="s2">same physics right with some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.490" end="00:22:52.779" style="s2">mathematics and the same mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.110" end="00:22:54.759" style="s2">tools it&#39;s it&#39;s something that exists</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.779" end="00:22:56.889" style="s2">independent of humanity so if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.759" end="00:23:00.269" style="s2">you&#39;re not a huge fan of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.889" end="00:23:03.909" style="s2">and but you you really like puzzles and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.269" end="00:23:05.409" style="s2">you&#39;re good at math physics is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.909" end="00:23:07.539" style="s2">attractive because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.409" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">the greatest puzzle there is in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.539" end="00:23:12.340" style="s2">universe and it exists completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.539" style="s2">independent of humanity and yet humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.340" end="00:23:16.450" style="s2">would be able to work on it and make</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.539" end="00:23:18.129" style="s2">progress which is freaking amazing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.450" end="00:23:21.850" style="s2">amazing the degree to which humans have</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.129" end="00:23:26.500" style="s2">understood our reality and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">we&#39;re getting close to having a commit</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.500" end="00:23:33.370" style="s2">three classes of greatest puzzles I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:35.879" style="s2">if I could I could tell a story that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.370" end="00:23:39.220" style="s2">biology is the greatest puzzle because</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.879" end="00:23:42.250" style="s2">now it without something to care about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.220" end="00:23:44.259" style="s2">the universe in which it lives this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.250" end="00:23:45.789" style="s2">all completely sterile to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.259" end="00:23:48.309" style="s2">I can also make a different case for</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.789" end="00:23:51.250" style="s2">mathematics which is that physics is but</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.309" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">one example of a universe we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.250" end="00:23:54.909" style="s2">if there are other universes that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2">could be concerned so so biology I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.909" end="00:23:59.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I I agree it&#39;s intricate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:01.059" style="s2">and it can be a pure pursuit but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.620" end="00:24:02.950" style="s2">not pure in the sense that so much of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.059" end="00:24:06.340" style="s2">the foundations of biology are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.950" end="00:24:08.110" style="s2">arbitrary like whether it you know DNA</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.340" end="00:24:10.179" style="s2">helix is going to spiral to the left or</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.110" end="00:24:12.700" style="s2">the right and and and what its chemical</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.179" end="00:24:14.500" style="s2">components are precisely that might very</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:17.889" style="s2">other planets you know other</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.500" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">civilizations biology be different you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.889" end="00:24:21.519" style="s2">can make a decent argument that systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:23.080" style="s2">of selective pressures as described by</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.519" end="00:24:25.010" style="s2">Darwin and Wallace there there might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.080" end="00:24:26.360" style="s2">conserved even if you had the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:29.030" style="s2">if carbon-based life there will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.360" end="00:24:30.980" style="s2">convergent evolution of course sure but</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.030" end="00:24:32.210" style="s2">but the details will be slightly</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:33.530" style="s2">different so if you&#39;re studying biology</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.210" end="00:24:38.300" style="s2">by the time you get up to something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.530" end="00:24:40.370" style="s2">cells or animals it&#39;s gonna be wildly</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.300" end="00:24:41.750" style="s2">different in different different places</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.370" end="00:24:45.080" style="s2">in the in the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.750" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">all right whereas whereas physics is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.080" end="00:24:50.060" style="s2">same everywhere okay it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:54.200" style="s2">independent of biology and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.060" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">independent of humanity and it&#39;s III</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.200" end="00:25:01.250" style="s2">think and then when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:25:03.170" style="s2">mathematics mathematics the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.250" end="00:25:06.800" style="s2">mathematics like how things get proved</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.170" end="00:25:10.490" style="s2">and how structures get built up through</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.800" end="00:25:13.790" style="s2">axioms that are then proved it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.490" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">a larger playing field than physics so</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.790" end="00:25:19.670" style="s2">within that huge arena of possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:21.350" style="s2">mathematical structures okay we see</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.670" end="00:25:25.430" style="s2">appear to live in one mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.350" end="00:25:27.920" style="s2">structure so I mean a physicist only has</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.430" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">to focus on the the mathematics that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.920" end="00:25:32.630" style="s2">that is reality and I by the way assure</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:34.340" style="s2">your intuition and in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.630" end="00:25:39.080" style="s2">this is the best and most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.340" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">place to play in part because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.080" end="00:25:43.370" style="s2">this very weird feature that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:46.760" style="s2">seemingly unearthed about the physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:51.230" style="s2">universe which is that it unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.760" end="00:25:54.740" style="s2">has this bizarrely good taste yeah about</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.230" end="00:25:59.030" style="s2">what to care about within it&#39;s as if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.740" end="00:26:01.400" style="s2">let it loose in the mathematical jewelry</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.030" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">store and it selects only the finest</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.400" end="00:26:04.910" style="s2">pieces yeah yeah and we have to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:06.500" style="s2">if that&#39;s you know is that just our</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.910" end="00:26:09.380" style="s2">human take on it because our human</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.500" end="00:26:12.110" style="s2">aesthetics have evolved within this</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.380" end="00:26:16.430" style="s2">beautiful world in the universe so is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.110" end="00:26:20.150" style="s2">that I mean Douglas Adams described the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.430" end="00:26:22.430" style="s2">anthropic principle as a puddle of water</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">right and thinking it&#39;s like wow this</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.430" end="00:26:28.250" style="s2">this this hole I&#39;m in is just perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">formed to my shape all right isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.250" end="00:26:32.030" style="s2">wonderful how it just fits me so</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:34.340" style="s2">perfectly in it and it&#39;s so comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.030" end="00:26:36.410" style="s2">here just like it was made for me well</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.340" end="00:26:38.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like no the puddle got there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.410" end="00:26:40.050" style="s2">filled the shape of the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.040" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">I mean the water got there and filled</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.050" end="00:26:44.490" style="s2">that shape and as humans we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">here and we filled this niche and our</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.490" end="00:26:48.690" style="s2">aesthetic taste was shaped by what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.230" end="00:26:50.100" style="s2">around us including the the mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.690" end="00:26:52.410" style="s2">that underlies the physics of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.100" end="00:26:55.380" style="s2">universe and so when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.410" end="00:26:57.240" style="s2">universe you might say oh no maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.380" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">just our tastes evolved within this</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.240" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">universe so this is why we find physics</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:02.340" style="s2">aesthetically pleasing do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:07.170" style="s2">believe what you&#39;re saying right now no</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.340" end="00:27:10.530" style="s2">I think it&#39;s wrong I mean this is so</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.170" end="00:27:11.910" style="s2">powered Lee I know I agree and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.530" end="00:27:13.980" style="s2">wonder about it I have to I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.910" end="00:27:15.030" style="s2">understand every little service you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.980" end="00:27:17.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not just lip service I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.030" end="00:27:20.520" style="s2">about this I mean I think I mean is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.790" end="00:27:22.260" style="s2">really my proclivities have been shaped</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.520" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">by my environment in order to think this</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.260" end="00:27:25.380" style="s2">because I have to question everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:28.710" style="s2">all the time sure mostly cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.380" end="00:27:30.840" style="s2">talk to enough other people but but also</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:31.860" style="s2">it&#39;s because you know you yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.840" end="00:27:33.240" style="s2">you&#39;re questioning things and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.860" end="00:27:35.220" style="s2">delving with fundamental building blocks</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.240" end="00:27:36.800" style="s2">you want to make sure as you build</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.220" end="00:27:39.060" style="s2">things up that you have things right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.800" end="00:27:41.100" style="s2">in looking at the fundamental physics</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.060" end="00:27:43.370" style="s2">pieces of physics you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.100" end="00:27:45.450" style="s2">fundamental mathematical physics I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.370" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">really think that the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.450" end="00:27:49.680" style="s2">pieces are as you say are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:52.050" style="s2">are extraordinarily beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.680" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">not just my aesthetic taste has been</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.050" end="00:27:56.940" style="s2">shaped by evolution that causes me to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:59.160" style="s2">think that I really think objectively</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.940" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">these are very pretty mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.160" end="00:28:03.090" style="s2">objects being underlying our physical</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:06.540" style="s2">reality yeah I think we just lack the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.090" end="00:28:09.930" style="s2">courage to say what this appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.540" end="00:28:11.820" style="s2">which is there is something that we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.930" end="00:28:13.710" style="s2">not understand about the universe in</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.820" end="00:28:19.230" style="s2">which it is selected for the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.710" end="00:28:23.220" style="s2">mysterious most beautiful stuff with</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.230" end="00:28:26.100" style="s2">which to write what we I mean with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.220" end="00:28:27.510" style="s2">closest thing we have to source code we</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.100" end="00:28:29.610" style="s2">don&#39;t we&#39;re not at the source code yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.510" end="00:28:34.230" style="s2">we&#39;re not quite at that layer right baby</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.610" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">I smell it can&#39;t you well I mean yes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.230" end="00:28:41.370" style="s2">no feels closed I think it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:43.680" style="s2">provably closed but but the there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.370" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">caveat to that which is I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.680" end="00:28:50.400" style="s2">almost at the end of this chapter and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">does feel like it could easily be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.400" end="00:28:54.570" style="s2">final chapter</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:56.070" style="s2">and by the way we should be we should</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.570" end="00:28:58.620" style="s2">clarify that when we sit when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.070" end="00:29:01.110" style="s2">about a theory of everything we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.620" end="00:29:03.059" style="s2">mean a theory that once understood could</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.110" end="00:29:05.519" style="s2">explain everything you see in your daily</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.059" end="00:29:07.409" style="s2">universe right we may be still gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.519" end="00:29:11.549" style="s2">a mystery of course now God you really</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.409" end="00:29:15.080" style="s2">did that of course I did but ya know</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.549" end="00:29:18.360" style="s2">ladies file form a single-file line</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.080" end="00:29:19.769" style="s2">there&#39;s evidence I mean there in our in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:21.750" style="s2">our understanding of physics as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.769" end="00:29:23.309" style="s2">learned more particles yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.750" end="00:29:24.809" style="s2">fundamental particles we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.309" end="00:29:28.950" style="s2">about appear to be filling out a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.809" end="00:29:31.769" style="s2">complete set I mean we&#39;ve you know when</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.950" end="00:29:35.909" style="s2">you when you predict that a towel quark</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.769" end="00:29:39.629" style="s2">should exist right know that a lepton</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.909" end="00:29:41.610" style="s2">should exist or you figure out that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.629" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">know it completes this set that&#39;s third</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.610" end="00:29:47.009" style="s2">generation it&#39;s complete right so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:48.539" style="s2">seem to be completing our set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.009" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">fundamental partner so we have three</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.539" end="00:29:52.740" style="s2">sets of Lego yeah right the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:55.230" style="s2">generation second generation and third</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.740" end="00:29:59.429" style="s2">generation of matter and all the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.230" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">in each generation are mirrored in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.429" end="00:30:03.450" style="s2">other two generations just a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.220" style="s2">mass scales so far that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.450" end="00:30:07.080" style="s2">like well it&#39;s not just so far it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.220" end="00:30:09.240" style="s2">we we have we have reasons to know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:11.669" style="s2">there aren&#39;t there aren&#39;t more from-from</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.240" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">how the Big Bang sent matter loose in</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.669" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">the universe we know that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:18.210" style="s2">more than three generations up there</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:20.100" style="s2">certain very high energy well we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.210" end="00:30:25.559" style="s2">known a lot of things Garrett that have</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.100" end="00:30:27.029" style="s2">turned out to be wrong ah well but this</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.559" end="00:30:29.789" style="s2">is really filling out a pretty complete</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.029" end="00:30:31.139" style="s2">pattern I don&#39;t dispute but I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.789" end="00:30:32.610" style="s2">accept except for this minor point of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.139" end="00:30:36.179" style="s2">dark matter still being completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.610" end="00:30:38.820" style="s2">unknown for the most part yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.179" end="00:30:41.009" style="s2">guess my discomfort with this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.820" end="00:30:43.649" style="s2">the fact that knowing the history I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.009" end="00:30:45.059" style="s2">how we&#39;ve been wrong and I also know how</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.649" end="00:30:47.490" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had the courage of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.059" end="00:30:52.679" style="s2">convictions and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.490" end="00:30:55.710" style="s2">really you know occupies my mind is why</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.679" end="00:30:57.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not more definite about things</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.710" end="00:30:59.789" style="s2">that I think we have very good good</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.720" end="00:31:01.409" style="s2">reason to believe and we&#39;re so definite</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.789" end="00:31:03.450" style="s2">about things that sort of scare me where</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.409" end="00:31:05.400" style="s2">we say I know that it can&#39;t be other</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:07.770" style="s2">than this</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.400" end="00:31:10.110" style="s2">and yet it has we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.770" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">shown up multiple times that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.110" end="00:31:15.180" style="s2">two different directives telling us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:19.680" style="s2">be both more confident and more humble</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.180" end="00:31:24.180" style="s2">right the thing that has affected both</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.680" end="00:31:26.700" style="s2">both you and myself most profoundly is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.180" end="00:31:29.340" style="s2">the existence of something called</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.700" end="00:31:30.900" style="s2">spinners at the core of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.340" end="00:31:32.400" style="s2">understanding of manner do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.900" end="00:31:35.430" style="s2">say a little bit about what that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.400" end="00:31:38.160" style="s2">Wyatt you think it&#39;s affected you and me</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.430" end="00:31:40.940" style="s2">as well and why perhaps it hasn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.160" end="00:31:44.100" style="s2">the same emotional and intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.940" end="00:31:48.920" style="s2">impact on the community right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.100" end="00:31:50.970" style="s2">when you&#39;re basically when physicists</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.920" end="00:31:52.110" style="s2">more or less completed that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.970" end="00:31:55.230" style="s2">called the standard model of particle</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.110" end="00:31:57.270" style="s2">physics right you have you have the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.230" end="00:31:59.070" style="s2">known forces in physics like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.270" end="00:32:00.600" style="s2">electromagnetic force the weak force and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.070" end="00:32:03.180" style="s2">the strong force as well as the force of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.600" end="00:32:05.730" style="s2">gravity and then you have the the matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.180" end="00:32:08.190" style="s2">particles which are electrons and quarks</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.730" end="00:32:12.180" style="s2">and neutrinos and and other generations</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.190" end="00:32:14.430" style="s2">of these that that form you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.180" end="00:32:15.870" style="s2">would have called the fermions okay and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.430" end="00:32:17.850" style="s2">these are called the matter particles</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.870" end="00:32:20.250" style="s2">and then they have mass because of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.850" end="00:32:21.690" style="s2">interaction with the Higgs boson right</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.250" end="00:32:23.510" style="s2">which is sort of himbut it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.690" end="00:32:29.040" style="s2">to make sense to people it&#39;s not alright</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.510" end="00:32:31.230" style="s2">but anyway the the force particles</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.230" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">particles under rotations than the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.390" end="00:32:39.930" style="s2">matter particles all right so these</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:43.410" style="s2">matter particles they you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.930" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">basically rotate them 720 degrees to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.410" end="00:32:47.790" style="s2">return them to their original state all</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:49.920" style="s2">right where&#39;s most objects you rotate it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.790" end="00:32:52.500" style="s2">and you rotate it 360 degrees and get</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.920" end="00:32:54.900" style="s2">back to where you started all right but</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.500" end="00:32:56.730" style="s2">spinners are different right and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.900" end="00:32:59.010" style="s2">they behave in a very specific way and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very specific way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.010" end="00:33:04.800" style="s2">describing them mathematically but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.260" style="s2">described in an unusual way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.800" end="00:33:09.810" style="s2">described as a as a column of complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.260" end="00:33:11.390" style="s2">numbers or a column matrix if you like</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.810" end="00:33:14.790" style="s2">that&#39;s acted on by a rotation matrix</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.390" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">that tells you specifically how these</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.790" end="00:33:18.840" style="s2">particles transform under rotation</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">honestly that wouldn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.840" end="00:33:22.830" style="s2">to me and I don&#39;t think I can help all</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:25.110" style="s2">of my audience to guess that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.830" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">thing so so this is the way physicists</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.110" end="00:33:29.820" style="s2">are introduced to a description of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:31.170" style="s2">electrons well look I&#39;m just try to play</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.820" end="00:33:34.020" style="s2">with something while we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.170" end="00:33:35.700" style="s2">this is this way why you can&#39;t can I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.020" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">hand it off to you in about 10 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.700" end="00:33:41.010" style="s2">no you finish it out all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">found this description to be incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.010" end="00:33:46.170" style="s2">unsatisfying all right because the rest</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">of physics is not described this way</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.170" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">right you don&#39;t introduce a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">field that transforms a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">under rotations that&#39;s not how you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.950" style="s2">why would the universe do that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:33:58.530" style="s2">elegant it&#39;s not it&#39;s not geometric</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.950" end="00:33:59.790" style="s2">right it seems sort of arbitrary why</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.530" end="00:34:02.820" style="s2">would the universe have spinners in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.790" end="00:34:04.680" style="s2">well it turns out that because if you if</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.820" end="00:34:06.090" style="s2">you describe Kjell relativity as curving</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.680" end="00:34:08.850" style="s2">four-dimensional space-time describe</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.090" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">gravity and you just tribe forces as</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.850" end="00:34:13.530" style="s2">gauge fields right with both of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">they&#39;re very geometric descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.530" end="00:34:17.700" style="s2">they&#39;re very elegant mathematically when</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.360" end="00:34:18.930" style="s2">you scribe physically the fermions as</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.700" end="00:34:20.910" style="s2">spinners it looks like a kludge</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.930" end="00:34:24.630" style="s2">it just it doesn&#39;t fit with the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.910" end="00:34:26.370" style="s2">theories but that&#39;s why I left physics</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.630" end="00:34:30.420" style="s2">to solve this problem I wanted to know</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.370" end="00:34:31.470" style="s2">why spinners geometrically and no one</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.420" end="00:34:32.280" style="s2">else was interested in the problem no</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.470" end="00:34:33.930" style="s2">one else thought it was a problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.280" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">they&#39;re like yeah they transform this</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.930" end="00:34:37.710" style="s2">way and and maybe it comes from strings</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:39.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s all you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.710" end="00:34:41.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s like no that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.330" end="00:34:43.350" style="s2">unsatisfying if gravity is described</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.670" end="00:34:45.660" style="s2">geometrically and are all our other</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.350" end="00:34:47.370" style="s2">forces described geometrically the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.660" end="00:34:49.170" style="s2">universe is just one thing it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.370" end="00:34:52.290" style="s2">there in the name I mean Yoona is one</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.170" end="00:34:55.020" style="s2">verse is turning we have we have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.290" end="00:34:57.840" style="s2">one turning thing we call the universe</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.020" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s just one mathematical object</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.840" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">and if this if we have different</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.240" style="s2">particles they have to be aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:04.860" style="s2">this one mathematical object why would</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.240" end="00:35:06.090" style="s2">this mathematical object have spinners</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.860" end="00:35:08.010" style="s2">as an aspect of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.090" end="00:35:09.090" style="s2">it was a huge mystery to me I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.010" end="00:35:12.450" style="s2">go solve it no one else even</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.090" end="00:35:14.460" style="s2">acknowledged it was a problem and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.450" end="00:35:19.140" style="s2">also tackled this this also bothered you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.460" end="00:35:20.910" style="s2">well there was a so this is the very</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.140" end="00:35:22.830" style="s2">difficult part of what the portal is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.910" end="00:35:25.350" style="s2">supposed to be and I have the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.830" end="00:35:27.690" style="s2">that we&#39;ve probably left a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.350" end="00:35:28.950" style="s2">listeners behind but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve said that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.690" end="00:35:31.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to take some risks</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.950" end="00:35:34.410" style="s2">and this is going to be one of them so</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.980" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">the way I see it some some of our</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.410" end="00:35:41.550" style="s2">listeners are also viewers right and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">have in studio these beautiful Klein</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.550" end="00:35:47.310" style="s2">bottles from Acme Klein bottle and cliff</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">stole out of Oakland I guess these</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.310" end="00:35:52.550" style="s2">objects that I&#39;m holding up or you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:56.130" style="s2">look up Klein bottles on the on the web</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.550" end="00:35:59.430" style="s2">have this very odd property that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.130" end="00:36:01.230" style="s2">are covered if you will by the surface</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.430" end="00:36:04.190" style="s2">of a doughnut if the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.230" end="00:36:08.579" style="s2">doughnut wraps around this object twice</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.190" end="00:36:10.380" style="s2">and we call this a double cover now the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.579" end="00:36:13.109" style="s2">idea that you have some very strange</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.380" end="00:36:15.270" style="s2">object with no inside and outside called</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.109" end="00:36:17.910" style="s2">a Klein bottle but that it&#39;s wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.270" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">twice by some object which has different</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.910" end="00:36:22.710" style="s2">properties namely the surface of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:25.170" style="s2">doughnut called a torus the rotations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.710" end="00:36:28.290" style="s2">our three-dimensional space bizarrely</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.170" end="00:36:30.359" style="s2">have some object that covers them twice</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.290" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">just as a doughnut it covers a Klein</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.359" end="00:36:34.650" style="s2">model toys so when we talk this crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.109" style="s2">language about you have to rotate an</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.650" end="00:36:39.750" style="s2">object more than 360 degrees for it to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.109" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">come back to itself this is somewhat of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.750" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">garbage language that we&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">people to understand where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:47.339" style="s2">really showing them what&#39;s behind the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:48.599" style="s2">curtain</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.339" end="00:36:49.980" style="s2">we&#39;re not showing them that there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.599" end="00:36:52.500" style="s2">the rotations of a rigid</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.980" end="00:36:55.980" style="s2">three-dimensional space and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.500" end="00:36:59.940" style="s2">this thing that covers those rotations</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.980" end="00:37:01.710" style="s2">twice called the spin group and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.940" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">spin group is the thing that has the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.710" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">property that it acts on these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:09.089" style="s2">called spinners so this is a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.450" end="00:37:11.670" style="s2">level of structure that you would not</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.089" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">know was there just from</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.670" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">three-dimensional space there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">secret trapped in three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:21.210" style="s2">space that is very well hidden and if we</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">weren&#39;t at a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.210" end="00:37:25.770" style="s2">mathematics or physics you would never</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:28.319" style="s2">know that spinners even exist to play</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.770" end="00:37:29.970" style="s2">with right I mean it comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.319" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">representation theory but that once</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.970" end="00:37:32.970" style="s2">again that&#39;s a fairly high level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:35.339" style="s2">mathematics you have to get to to even</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.970" end="00:37:38.060" style="s2">see that these things exist and for all</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.339" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">of the other basic kinds of symmetries</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.060" end="00:37:42.780" style="s2">we don&#39;t have these hidden</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:44.510" style="s2">representations we don&#39;t have these</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.510" end="00:37:49.070" style="s2">that have these bizarre properties it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:51.740" style="s2">only for these things called orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.070" end="00:37:57.380" style="s2">groups so it&#39;s a very special property</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.740" end="00:37:59.960" style="s2">of real Euclidean rigid space that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.380" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">spinners are there to be found and not</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:08.810" style="s2">of matter around the hidden object that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.720" end="00:38:13.970" style="s2">can&#39;t easily be seen or deduced which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.810" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">a total mind job right and the math</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.970" end="00:38:18.830" style="s2">community has in fact sort of split</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">between people who think hey we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.830" end="00:38:23.600" style="s2">describe these things mathematically so</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:26.780" style="s2">our work is done versus other people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.600" end="00:38:30.290" style="s2">believe there&#39;s something about spinners</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.780" end="00:38:31.700" style="s2">that just it continues to surprise us we</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.290" end="00:38:34.190" style="s2">don&#39;t understand where they came from</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.700" end="00:38:35.930" style="s2">they&#39;re a hidden feature of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.190" end="00:38:41.270" style="s2">and they keep giving in this very</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.930" end="00:38:43.160" style="s2">mysterious fashion yeah and the most of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.270" end="00:38:46.490" style="s2">the general relativists who came at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.160" end="00:38:49.660" style="s2">problem um just would not want to touch</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.490" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">it because it&#39;s too far into them and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.660" end="00:38:53.780" style="s2">the people came into it from the</p>

<p begin="00:39:15.820" end="00:39:23.390" style="s2">okay so the idea is that I&#39;ve got stuff</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.830" end="00:41:37.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a big difference yeah and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.380" end="00:41:40.530" style="s2">mean I can almost describe it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.290" end="00:41:42.540" style="s2">extremely simple terms which is most</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.540" end="00:41:48.510" style="s2">it think of gravitational charge as</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.510" end="00:41:55.859" style="s2">really spin well you we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.060" end="00:42:00.920" style="s2">pretty up we&#39;re getting pretty far</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.859" end="00:42:04.200" style="s2">afield all right so to speak so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.920" end="00:42:06.359" style="s2">so let&#39;s imagine that maybe our</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.200" end="00:42:08.510" style="s2">listeners haven&#39;t understood exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.359" end="00:42:11.650" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying but that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.510" end="00:42:13.510" style="s2">special problem about spinners and have</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.650" end="00:42:16.690" style="s2">how they&#39;re tied to the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.510" end="00:42:19.030" style="s2">space-time that is different where you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.690" end="00:42:21.190" style="s2">can describe things like photons in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.030" end="00:42:23.140" style="s2">sense without knowing how length and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.190" end="00:42:24.670" style="s2">angle are measured whereas length and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.140" end="00:42:27.700" style="s2">angle are essential if you&#39;re ever going</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.670" end="00:42:30.010" style="s2">to talk about spinners now you and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.700" end="00:42:31.720" style="s2">have two very different points of view</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.010" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">and the reason that I consider you an</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.720" end="00:42:40.270" style="s2">arch nemesis is that I think your theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.650" end="00:42:41.470" style="s2">based on i-84 those who are viewing on</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.270" end="00:42:47.290" style="s2">YouTube thanks for bringing your</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.290" end="00:42:52.660" style="s2">this is to say let&#39;s start out with some</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.740" end="00:42:54.760" style="s2">object that is mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.660" end="00:42:56.590" style="s2">distinguished and very peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.760" end="00:42:59.140" style="s2">effectively like a platypus of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.590" end="00:43:02.500" style="s2">mathematical world and let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.140" end="00:43:04.360" style="s2">distill from this thing that has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.500" end="00:43:09.360" style="s2">exist for reasons of logical necessity</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.360" end="00:43:09.360" style="s2">and is accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.630" end="00:43:15.400" style="s2">arguably that you could pick and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.300" end="00:43:22.150" style="s2">find the richness of our natural world</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.400" end="00:43:24.970" style="s2">as distilled from this bizarre freakish</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.150" end="00:43:27.880" style="s2">occurrence in the laws of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.970" end="00:43:32.140" style="s2">necessity is that a fair telling um from</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.880" end="00:43:34.600" style="s2">a top-down perspective it is but the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.140" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">I got there is by describing spinners</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.600" end="00:43:38.770" style="s2">and saying that spinners is part of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:43.180" style="s2">one beautiful mathematical object</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.770" end="00:43:45.340" style="s2">naturally and it&#39;s it&#39;s unique to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.180" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">exceptional League groups to these this</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.340" end="00:43:49.420" style="s2">class the small class of objects when</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">you say exceptionally groups what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.420" end="00:43:55.210" style="s2">mean is lot of high continuous</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:57.370" style="s2">symmetries that only occur once that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:44:02.470" style="s2">they don&#39;t fall into some regular</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.370" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">pattern right okay and and spinners are</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.470" end="00:44:06.790" style="s2">naturally a part of their geometry and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:08.530" style="s2">there and there and there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.790" end="00:44:10.540" style="s2">intricate beautiful objects they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.530" end="00:44:13.620" style="s2">spinners naturally as part of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.540" end="00:44:15.820" style="s2">geometry and that if you dissect them</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.620" end="00:44:17.230" style="s2">you can see all the other parts</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.820" end="00:44:20.140" style="s2">necessary to particle physics and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.230" end="00:44:22.330" style="s2">gravity and this was just stunning to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.140" end="00:44:24.470" style="s2">and at this point I&#39;m like alright I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.330" end="00:44:26.030" style="s2">built up from the ground up from from</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.470" end="00:44:27.830" style="s2">article physics and from gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.030" end="00:44:29.630" style="s2">from spinners have built the structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.830" end="00:44:32.440" style="s2">up in seeing how it&#39;s all interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.630" end="00:44:35.030" style="s2">and I found that they&#39;re all part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.440" end="00:44:37.490" style="s2">this small class of mathematical objects</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.030" end="00:44:40.310" style="s2">that are that are unique in their</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.490" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">intricacy and beauty for finite</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.310" end="00:44:47.240" style="s2">dimensional objects and that&#39;s why now I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:48.770" style="s2">appear to have adopted more of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.240" end="00:44:50.300" style="s2">top-down view where it seems like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.770" end="00:44:52.010" style="s2">started with this pretty object I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.300" end="00:44:53.330" style="s2">oh look it explains everything but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.010" end="00:44:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;s nowhere near like that how I</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.330" end="00:44:57.380" style="s2">actually got to there all right the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.640" end="00:45:00.500" style="s2">truth is I&#39;m building up and the truth</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.380" end="00:45:03.740" style="s2">is the next object is going to be higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.500" end="00:45:07.010" style="s2">dimensional objects that include ae8</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.740" end="00:45:09.530" style="s2">like this one as a subgroup so the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.010" end="00:45:10.790" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing you garrett and again you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.530" end="00:45:12.619" style="s2">know this is like one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.790" end="00:45:14.150" style="s2">obscure let&#39;s get at least I&#39;m eager</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.619" end="00:45:15.320" style="s2">listeners but I was gonna be I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.150" end="00:45:17.780" style="s2">to talk about well but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.320" end="00:45:19.490" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to describe this I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.780" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">like to describe this a little bit as as</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.490" end="00:45:23.930" style="s2">if we were taking somebody to an opera</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.940" style="s2">in a foreign language so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.930" end="00:45:30.020" style="s2">follow the plot even though they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.940" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">follow line by line okay the way I see</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.020" end="00:45:35.480" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:38.349" style="s2">usual kind of symmetry which we would</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.480" end="00:45:42.680" style="s2">associate with bosons that is the force</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.349" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2">particles of the universe and what makes</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.680" end="00:45:48.020" style="s2">these very strange objects that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve referred to as in referring to</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:11.570" style="s2">that&#39;s very clear okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.470" end="00:46:14.089" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge problem with the strategy</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.869" end="00:46:42.150" style="s2">you fuse them together to get</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.150" end="00:46:49.080" style="s2">object but the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.850" end="00:46:52.380" style="s2">strategy is is that we know that nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.080" end="00:46:54.210" style="s2">has these two very different recipes for</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.500" end="00:47:22.140" style="s2">done it you&#39;ve really taken the fermions</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.770" end="00:47:23.610" style="s2">that is the matter part that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.140" end="00:47:25.710" style="s2">spinners that we&#39;ve been discussing</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.610" end="00:47:29.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve lumped them together with the</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.810" end="00:47:43.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.950" end="00:47:45.570" style="s2">though the the fermions just end up</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.490" end="00:47:55.560" style="s2">actually works I mean this is this is my</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.830" end="00:47:57.090" style="s2">great about my criticisms of your theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.560" end="00:47:58.740" style="s2">which we&#39;ve known each other now for 11</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.210" end="00:48:47.460" style="s2">allottee okay that was that was true but</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.790" end="00:48:50.910" style="s2">there really wasn&#39;t in my opinion enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.460" end="00:48:51.420" style="s2">room to pack the particles that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.910" end="00:48:55.319" style="s2">current</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.260" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">all because the of the unit of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:04.829" style="s2">particular way in which bosons and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:07.950" style="s2">fermions matter enforce were fused</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.829" end="00:49:10.890" style="s2">together it really pushed everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.950" end="00:49:12.690" style="s2">towards the bosonic side that is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.890" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">force side of the equation so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.690" end="00:49:16.859" style="s2">gonna now have to be in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:19.650" style="s2">technical debt where you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.859" end="00:49:22.200" style="s2">figure out how to get the fermions back</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.650" end="00:49:23.940" style="s2">into a matter framework because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.200" end="00:49:27.900" style="s2">would actually push them too far through</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.940" end="00:49:33.930" style="s2">unification into a union with force that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.900" end="00:49:36.359" style="s2">was another basic concern and my last</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.930" end="00:49:38.549" style="s2">concern was that because of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.359" end="00:49:41.790" style="s2">properties of this object you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.549" end="00:49:45.960" style="s2">have any room for what we call chirality</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.790" end="00:49:47.670" style="s2">in which the universe that we&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.960" end="00:49:49.650" style="s2">far appears to have a left-right</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.670" end="00:49:56.579" style="s2">asymmetry to it it&#39;s as if it has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.650" end="00:49:59.010" style="s2">beauty mark and these the any object</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.579" end="00:50:01.799" style="s2">that you derive from eh is gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.010" end="00:50:03.510" style="s2">hard to get it to have a beauty mark</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.799" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">because II eight doesn&#39;t have a beauty</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.510" end="00:50:07.309" style="s2">mark itself so these were three things</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:10.020" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to have to pay back</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.309" end="00:50:12.270" style="s2">right if you were going to connect this</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.020" end="00:50:14.309" style="s2">to the world that we see and I that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.270" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">might yeah irritation with you was is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.309" end="00:50:19.890" style="s2">that I brought this up with you in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:22.380" style="s2">and you remind me 2008 not 2009 when we</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.890" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">met at the Perimeter Institute and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.380" end="00:50:25.650" style="s2">tried to warn you about these things I</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:26.849" style="s2">felt like you never took me seriously no</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.650" end="00:50:30.680" style="s2">I did take these here so you have taken</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.849" end="00:50:34.680" style="s2">all these problems seriously and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.680" end="00:50:36.359" style="s2">discussed in subsequent work and the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.680" end="00:50:39.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve been resolving them is by tackling</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.359" end="00:50:42.030" style="s2">a larger unspoken problem which is how</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.690" end="00:50:45.000" style="s2">to have a quantum description of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.030" end="00:50:48.869" style="s2">sort of geometry all right because our</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.000" end="00:50:51.630" style="s2">universe is a quantum universe and EA</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.869" end="00:50:54.450" style="s2">tis a finite dimensional object and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.630" end="00:50:56.130" style="s2">have to have multiple states multiple</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.450" end="00:50:58.770" style="s2">numbers of particles be able to occupy</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.130" end="00:51:00.390" style="s2">every state so if you have a full</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.770" end="00:51:02.760" style="s2">quantum description of a theory you need</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.390" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">an infinite dimensional geometry to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.760" end="00:51:07.350" style="s2">it well I always thought your</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.310" end="00:51:09.270" style="s2">your goal was to take a finite object</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.350" end="00:51:11.550" style="s2">and then take waves on that finite</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.270" end="00:51:12.900" style="s2">object to create something that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.550" end="00:51:14.490" style="s2">going to be infinite dimensional I</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.900" end="00:51:17.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t see that it&#39;s a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.490" end="00:51:18.090" style="s2">that&#39;s not good enough say more because</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.160" end="00:51:19.860" style="s2">just-just-just</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.090" end="00:51:21.390" style="s2">when you talk about waves on geometric</p>

<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:31.850" style="s2">all the structure you need for quantum</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.090" end="00:51:33.780" style="s2">field theory you really need a</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.360" end="00:51:46.110" style="s2">looking at what sort of objects you need</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.780" end="00:51:48.270" style="s2">that include exceptional lis groups but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.110" end="00:51:50.390" style="s2">are infinite dimensional geometries that</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.390" end="00:51:54.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how you tackle the three problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.890" end="00:51:57.480" style="s2">you discussed you you yet you have you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.780" end="00:52:01.310" style="s2">can have more space to handle the three</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.930" end="00:52:13.470" style="s2">also you know large enough to give you</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.410" style="s2">easing here&#39;s the thing if I just think</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.610" end="00:52:44.040" style="s2">about where we are with the standard</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.410" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">model right you&#39;ve got four dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.040" end="00:52:51.030" style="s2">of space and time right then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:53.340" style="s2">an extra eight dimensions coming from</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.030" end="00:52:55.560" style="s2">something called su-33 dimensions from</p>

<p begin="00:53:02.670" end="00:53:07.860" style="s2">occurs and gravity people give up used</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.030" end="00:53:11.940" style="s2">to put in six dimensions for something</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.860" end="00:53:13.650" style="s2">called spin three one okay but the point</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.940" end="00:53:16.710" style="s2">is I can add those all up and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.650" end="00:53:18.860" style="s2">get some number probably you know in 20</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.710" end="00:53:22.310" style="s2">s of dimension 20 some-odd dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.860" end="00:53:24.410" style="s2">ever that finite thing generates the</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.410" end="00:53:30.710" style="s2">field but quantum field theory there we</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.050" end="00:53:33.500" style="s2">have a way of mapping between those the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.710" end="00:53:35.960" style="s2">base geometry and then going to quantum</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.500" end="00:53:38.810" style="s2">field theory right then you have fox</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.960" end="00:53:40.190" style="s2">base right and you have occupation</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.810" end="00:53:43.910" style="s2">numbers for all the different possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.190" end="00:53:46.940" style="s2">states your it my point is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.910" end="00:53:50.990" style="s2">working on a problem that has certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.940" end="00:53:53.120" style="s2">foreseeable problems as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.990" end="00:53:57.320" style="s2">challenge and unlike your detractors</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.120" end="00:53:59.240" style="s2">from the more standard community I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.320" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">I&#39;m not telling you that you&#39;re dead on</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.240" end="00:54:03.620" style="s2">arrival just because certain problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:05.870" style="s2">can be seen that would be unfair and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.620" end="00:54:07.160" style="s2">then by the way that&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.870" end="00:54:09.410" style="s2">there are lots of problems that can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.160" end="00:54:11.630" style="s2">seen from the string theory community</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.410" end="00:54:13.490" style="s2">where let&#39;s say you know the the number</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.630" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">of dimensions it wants to play and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.490" end="00:54:16.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be the right number or</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:18.500" style="s2">that they thought there were only a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.730" end="00:54:19.880" style="s2">finite number of theories it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.500" end="00:54:21.470" style="s2">that there&#39;s a continuum of theories</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.880" end="00:54:23.270" style="s2">that or the vast majority come out with</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.470" end="00:54:25.940" style="s2">right and it and I get very irritated</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.270" end="00:54:28.460" style="s2">that somehow the string theory community</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.940" end="00:54:30.620" style="s2">is entitled to make all these mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.460" end="00:54:32.990" style="s2">and anybody outside if they say one</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.620" end="00:54:35.240" style="s2">wrong thing or one seemingly wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.990" end="00:54:38.540" style="s2">they&#39;re excommunicated it&#39;s a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.240" end="00:54:39.710" style="s2">standard okay that&#39;s not what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.540" end="00:54:42.200" style="s2">to do to you I&#39;m trying to say something</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.710" end="00:54:43.670" style="s2">very different which is you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.200" end="00:54:46.250" style="s2">be up against the fact that if your</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.670" end="00:54:48.050" style="s2">initial data comes from this most</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.250" end="00:54:51.650" style="s2">beautiful and most bizarre of all</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.050" end="00:54:53.120" style="s2">objects he ate and that doesn&#39;t contain</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.650" end="00:54:55.270" style="s2">as I said I&#39;m now working on its</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.120" end="00:54:58.010" style="s2">generalizations to infinite dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.270" end="00:55:00.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s an issue of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.010" end="00:55:02.570" style="s2">check-kiting like I don&#39;t mind the idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.680" end="00:55:04.820" style="s2">that you recognize the debts that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.570" end="00:55:06.860" style="s2">in and then you say I think I have a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.820" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">of getting this thing to close off right</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.860" end="00:55:11.570" style="s2">but there is a question of well now that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:13.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve recognized am i right I mean am i</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.570" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">right yeah yeah right i right that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.160" end="00:55:18.980" style="s2">issues that I raised with you initially</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:22.070" style="s2">turned out to be really serious problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.980" end="00:55:24.050" style="s2">of course I mean and you did that back</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.070" end="00:55:26.900" style="s2">then yeah I did they were there in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.050" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">paper there in the original paper saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.900" end="00:55:30.040" style="s2">that the the description of three</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:32.270" style="s2">generations was very hand wavy and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.040" end="00:55:35.660" style="s2">unsatisfactory that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.270" end="00:55:37.400" style="s2">on paper okay my recollection was that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.660" end="00:55:39.800" style="s2">when I tried to explain to you why</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.400" end="00:55:41.660" style="s2">people were going to have the objection</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.800" end="00:55:43.730" style="s2">about the two different quantization</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.660" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">schemes that that was not handled</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.730" end="00:55:48.320" style="s2">correctly right I handled that in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">paper in 2010 or so okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.320" end="00:55:52.310" style="s2">cosmology all right that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.230" style="s2">the issue yeah then there&#39;s gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.310" end="00:55:56.360" style="s2">issue that you weren&#39;t able to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.230" end="00:55:58.520" style="s2">left-right asymmetry out of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.360" end="00:56:00.710" style="s2">data there wasn&#39;t enough and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.520" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">fair description absolutely okay and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.710" end="00:56:07.550" style="s2">then you&#39;re saying that the I ceded to</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:09.260" style="s2">you that you were making a connection</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.550" end="00:56:12.350" style="s2">between the mysterious appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.260" end="00:56:14.740" style="s2">three copies of matter and something</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.350" end="00:56:17.960" style="s2">called try ality which was not manifest</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.740" end="00:56:19.490" style="s2">obviously inside of EA to the few people</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.960" end="00:56:22.610" style="s2">who actually care about this structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.490" end="00:56:25.910" style="s2">it it definitely is there in a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.610" end="00:56:29.270" style="s2">profound way it relates to rotations in</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.910" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">eight dimensional spaces yes but you</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.270" end="00:56:38.810" style="s2">also haven&#39;t taken an interest in what</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:40.850" style="s2">is eight if not the the wellspring for</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.810" end="00:56:42.650" style="s2">the source code of the universe like if</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.850" end="00:56:45.410" style="s2">it isn&#39;t the unit I think it&#39;s a piece</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.650" end="00:56:46.970" style="s2">of it but I&#39;m not religious Eric I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.410" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna explore whatever seems</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.970" end="00:56:52.670" style="s2">most promising to explore okay and well</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:56.510" style="s2">have you changed your your sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.670" end="00:56:58.310" style="s2">status of ei tis a candidate for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.510" end="00:57:00.770" style="s2">unified theory in the fashion that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.310" end="00:57:02.840" style="s2">were originally seeing absolutely you</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.770" end="00:57:07.960" style="s2">have changed your view yes can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.840" end="00:57:10.670" style="s2">about that right so it was in tackling</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.960" end="00:57:12.440" style="s2">quantum field theory and how to describe</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.670" end="00:57:14.180" style="s2">it geometrically which as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.440" end="00:57:16.730" style="s2">nobody has done I mean whenever whenever</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.180" end="00:57:18.650" style="s2">you have you start with as you say you</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.730" end="00:57:20.150" style="s2">want an su 2 su 3 and you go through</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.650" end="00:57:22.160" style="s2">this quantization procedure for its</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.150" end="00:57:23.990" style="s2">field so you know field theory or if</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with strings right you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.990" end="00:57:27.620" style="s2">have this model of vibrating strings in</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:29.600" style="s2">higher dimensions then you go through</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.620" end="00:57:31.580" style="s2">this quantization procedure to get a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.600" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">quantum quantum theory of strings okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.580" end="00:57:37.880" style="s2">all right we have we physicists have</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.440" end="00:57:39.560" style="s2">this toolkit for quantizing things but</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.880" end="00:57:42.440" style="s2">that&#39;s utterly the wrong way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.560" end="00:57:45.710" style="s2">reality if if the universe is just one</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.440" end="00:57:48.109" style="s2">thing which it is then it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.710" end="00:57:49.640" style="s2">magical object I mean you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.109" end="00:57:51.320" style="s2">point that is very well understood I</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.640" end="00:57:52.790" style="s2">believe in the right standards</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.320" end="00:57:54.859" style="s2">theoretical physics community which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.790" end="00:57:57.109" style="s2">that if the world starts off as quantum</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.859" end="00:57:58.900" style="s2">right you should talk about classical</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.109" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">izing pieces of it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.900" end="00:58:02.839" style="s2">quantities in the classical pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:07.820" style="s2">appear to exist yeah that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.839" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">right so so what&#39;s a quantum geometric</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.820" end="00:58:12.380" style="s2">object look like it&#39;s in you know with</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:14.180" style="s2">with all these infinite dimensional Fox</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.380" end="00:58:17.480" style="s2">space and the creation and annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.180" end="00:58:18.890" style="s2">of of elementary particles people people</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.480" end="00:58:22.190" style="s2">at home won&#39;t know what a fox spaces</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.890" end="00:58:25.640" style="s2">Rock space is effectively where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.190" end="00:58:29.720" style="s2">states of the system can live when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.640" end="00:58:31.099" style="s2">have multiple particles in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.720" end="00:58:33.530" style="s2">and you can change the number of</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.099" end="00:58:35.990" style="s2">particles that you have just the way a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.530" end="00:58:40.490" style="s2">photon can break into an electron and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.990" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">positron pair that would be possible in</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.490" end="00:58:45.260" style="s2">a fox space not possible in a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:47.210" style="s2">quantum so that&#39;s right so effectively a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.260" end="00:58:49.070" style="s2">fox base is just a large place to play</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.210" end="00:58:53.750" style="s2">where the number of particles in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.070" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">system can change up to infinity going</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.750" end="00:58:59.480" style="s2">so in order to describe this as one</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:00.980" style="s2">geometric object you&#39;re stuck with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.480" end="00:59:04.910" style="s2">generalized lis group infinite</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.980" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">dimensional generalize Li group yes and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.910" end="00:59:12.550" style="s2">in order to describe spinners it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:15.380" style="s2">to be an exceptional generalize Li group</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.550" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.380" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">adding anything I think that the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:22.550" style="s2">here is is that he ate is an</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.849" end="00:59:39.080" style="s2">symmetries that&#39;s right but in that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.589" end="00:59:41.510" style="s2">what it&#39;s not only inadequate it would</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.080" end="00:59:44.210" style="s2">push them into a universe of pure force</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.510" end="00:59:46.430" style="s2">rather than a universe divided between</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.430" end="00:59:52.339" style="s2">problem is the kind of unification it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.800" end="00:59:54.440" style="s2">would create would be completely force</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.540" end="01:00:05.270" style="s2">on a problem that that that was you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:07.100" style="s2">they solved in a paper in 2010 but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.270" end="01:00:09.830" style="s2">very simply that fermions are orthogonal</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.100" end="01:00:12.290" style="s2">to space-time whereas you know the force</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.830" end="01:00:16.370" style="s2">fields at boson fields are a long</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.290" end="01:00:17.660" style="s2">space-time in the same way the the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.370" end="01:00:18.770" style="s2">way if you have to force fields that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.660" end="01:00:21.020" style="s2">along space-time but in different</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.770" end="01:00:22.790" style="s2">directions they would anti commute right</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.020" end="01:00:26.120" style="s2">so you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.790" end="01:00:28.490" style="s2">space-time if you will which is again</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.120" end="01:00:32.090" style="s2">kind of a classical Einstein Ian concept</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.490" end="01:00:35.030" style="s2">to break apart a unified system which</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.090" end="01:00:36.980" style="s2">was the intention in unification to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.030" end="01:00:40.300" style="s2">begin with and then you&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.980" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">to treat these two things naturally</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.300" end="01:00:44.270" style="s2">according to two totally different</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:47.840" style="s2">prescriptions that&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.270" end="01:00:49.700" style="s2">violating I mean in some sense any kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.840" end="01:00:52.250" style="s2">of naturality that you just picked up in</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.700" end="01:00:53.720" style="s2">the unification to begin with in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.250" end="01:00:57.560" style="s2">yeah but the symmetry has to break some</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.720" end="01:01:01.100" style="s2">how does it do it and in natural I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.560" end="01:01:03.950" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t feel this feels it allows</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.100" end="01:01:07.130" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t seem completely natural</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.950" end="01:01:09.650" style="s2">but it does allow it well but the whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.130" end="01:01:11.770" style="s2">point of the thing I thought was to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.650" end="01:01:14.300" style="s2">the natural T and what we had understood</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.770" end="01:01:16.940" style="s2">about the nature of these exceptional</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:20.810" style="s2">objects and to say hey these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.940" end="01:01:23.410" style="s2">actually unify beautifully inside of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.810" end="01:01:26.270" style="s2">these very unusual elegant mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.410" end="01:01:28.520" style="s2">structures they do but it was it was too</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.270" end="01:01:30.380" style="s2">small as you said it was too small</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.520" end="01:01:33.320" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t correctly contain</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.380" end="01:01:35.180" style="s2">three generations of matter and because</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.320" end="01:01:38.990" style="s2">it can&#39;t correctly portray quantum field</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.180" end="01:01:41.330" style="s2">theory but once you go to the larger</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.990" end="01:01:43.670" style="s2">general Eisley groups it can well you</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.330" end="01:01:46.430" style="s2">know if this was a start up what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.670" end="01:01:48.440" style="s2">saying is that the business is going</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.430" end="01:01:54.680" style="s2">great but it&#39;s just run out of money and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.440" end="01:01:56.630" style="s2">I needed a fresh intellectual check</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.680" end="01:02:05.870" style="s2">right no no it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s round be</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.630" end="01:02:08.690" style="s2">funding Series B I see R is a cash flow</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.870" end="01:02:12.260" style="s2">pause not yet I mean put the paper house</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.690" end="01:02:14.150" style="s2">yeah okay so the there&#39;s I mean I look</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.260" end="01:02:15.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not a question that I I need to see</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.150" end="01:02:18.859" style="s2">the paper or that you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.950" end="01:02:20.300" style="s2">take out more loans but are you getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.859" end="01:02:23.180" style="s2">what I mean I know you to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.300" end="01:02:25.270" style="s2">look I&#39;ve I hate to say this but I have</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.180" end="01:02:28.010" style="s2">defended you to the regular community</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.270" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">with some frequency because I have</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.010" end="01:02:32.840" style="s2">viewed you as an honest broker for your</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.230" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">own stuff I don&#39;t think you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.840" end="01:02:35.600" style="s2">get away with something I think thank</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:37.550" style="s2">you what you try it what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.600" end="01:02:39.859" style="s2">to do is you&#39;re trying to say I need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.550" end="01:02:41.660" style="s2">take some advances which I think and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.859" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">hope I can pay back which i think is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.660" end="01:02:47.660" style="s2">admirable and honourable way to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:49.820" style="s2">physics are you worried about your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.660" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">theory are you worried that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.820" end="01:02:55.340" style="s2">to infinite dimensions in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:58.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve been forced to modify on several</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.340" end="01:03:02.150" style="s2">previous occasions and that in fact this</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.130" end="01:03:03.619" style="s2">is not going to close I am unusually</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.150" end="01:03:09.710" style="s2">confident that I&#39;m on the right track</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.619" end="01:03:11.210" style="s2">with this one really yeah only there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.710" end="01:03:13.430" style="s2">too many things matching up in the right</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.210" end="01:03:16.910" style="s2">way this doesn&#39;t sound good</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.430" end="01:03:20.060" style="s2">Garrett I got to be honest but it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.910" end="01:03:23.240" style="s2">I will put a paper out yeah yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.060" end="01:03:24.740" style="s2">and you know people may not find it</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.240" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">interesting or they might find it really</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.740" end="01:03:31.970" style="s2">interesting well I wish you the best of</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:33.830" style="s2">luck but I have to tell you that I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.970" end="01:03:37.220" style="s2">think that the problems in this program</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.830" end="01:03:39.590" style="s2">I mean again I should just be honest</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.220" end="01:03:41.750" style="s2">about it I thought that the choice of e8</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.590" end="01:03:44.930" style="s2">was so natural but they&#39;re really one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.750" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">two choices that I can see is being the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.930" end="01:03:52.640" style="s2">way to go if you&#39;re going to avoid the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:55.010" style="s2">the usual paths in in research into into</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.640" end="01:03:56.869" style="s2">fundamental physics one is that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.010" end="01:03:59.930" style="s2">start with the most beautiful intricate</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.869" end="01:04:01.850" style="s2">object you can find and then you find</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.930" end="01:04:05.330" style="s2">the intricacies of the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.850" end="01:04:07.010" style="s2">somehow living inside of the intricacies</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.330" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">which occurred naturally that would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.010" end="01:04:10.369" style="s2">that way top down view and press and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:12.740" style="s2">it&#39;s quite nice to look at that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.369" end="01:04:14.600" style="s2">bottom-up view is that somehow you start</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.740" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">with something that&#39;s practically</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.600" end="01:04:20.150" style="s2">lifeless which I&#39;ve analogized to a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:24.380" style="s2">fertilized egg and somehow it bootstraps</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.150" end="01:04:25.670" style="s2">itself into this weird intricate and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.380" end="01:04:29.480" style="s2">baroque world that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.670" end="01:04:31.970" style="s2">find ourselves in and it sort of AutoCAD</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.480" end="01:04:35.119" style="s2">the universe Auto catalyzes from almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.970" end="01:04:37.660" style="s2">nothing and these are the two basic</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.119" end="01:04:40.579" style="s2">approaches that I can imagine that would</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.660" end="01:04:42.260" style="s2">not strain the concept of a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.579" end="01:04:44.599" style="s2">everything right well then we both</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.260" end="01:04:47.510" style="s2">engage in both of these but once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.599" end="01:04:49.730" style="s2">used this bottom-up approach right</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.510" end="01:04:52.210" style="s2">starting with your fertilized egg and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.730" end="01:04:56.859" style="s2">getting up into more and more complexity</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.210" end="01:04:59.359" style="s2">then you start to see a complete object</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.859" end="01:05:02.180" style="s2">after you&#39;ve expanded it out sorry you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.359" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">view yourself as exploring the concept</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.180" end="01:05:06.020" style="s2">of going from the bottom up what is it</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:09.079" style="s2">that you&#39;ve done that that has that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.020" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2">character starting from gravity and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.079" end="01:05:16.220" style="s2">particle physics and how they can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:19.430" style="s2">matched up together in a in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.220" end="01:05:23.270" style="s2">brings about natural okay that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.430" end="01:05:25.609" style="s2">not very simple at all well I know</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.270" end="01:05:27.589" style="s2">rabbity gravity is already you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.609" end="01:05:29.839" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the curvature of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.589" end="01:05:31.490" style="s2">space-time manifold that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.839" end="01:05:34.069" style="s2">stuff that I love it no it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.490" end="01:05:39.440" style="s2">gorgeous I don&#39;t think we&#39;re divided by</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.069" end="01:05:41.660" style="s2">that but when it comes to you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:43.790" style="s2">breaking up this object called the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.660" end="01:05:46.040" style="s2">curvature tensor into three different</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.790" end="01:05:48.290" style="s2">pieces throwing one of the one of them</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.040" end="01:05:51.109" style="s2">away called the viol curvature and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.290" end="01:05:54.760" style="s2">fine-tuning the other two to be equal to</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.109" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">the matter and energy in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.760" end="01:06:01.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s going into</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:03.020" style="s2">that story that isn&#39;t and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.400" end="01:06:05.770" style="s2">intricate story and then the other story</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.020" end="01:06:08.630" style="s2">is even worse and right here der yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.770" end="01:06:12.109" style="s2">you know you&#39;re smuggling in a ton of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.630" end="01:06:15.770" style="s2">complexity when I say fertilized egg I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.109" end="01:06:18.020" style="s2">thinking at the level of cytology but</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.770" end="01:06:21.200" style="s2">you know at the level of the actual DNA</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.020" end="01:06:22.940" style="s2">that&#39;s incredibly rich so you when I you</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.200" end="01:06:24.650" style="s2">know maybe it&#39;s a bad analogy because</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.650" end="01:06:29.059" style="s2">nothing right you&#39;re smuggling in a ton</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.260" end="01:06:30.589" style="s2">of intricacy but you have to look in</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.059" end="01:06:32.780" style="s2">both directions you have to look from</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.589" end="01:06:35.329" style="s2">the bottom up and then once you can see</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.780" end="01:06:37.390" style="s2">the larger picture then you have to look</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.329" end="01:06:40.180" style="s2">again from the top down</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.390" end="01:06:43.120" style="s2">and if going that way from the top down</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.180" end="01:06:45.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t match up very well with with</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.120" end="01:06:47.680" style="s2">what you did to get there then you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.730" end="01:06:51.040" style="s2">to go further and so you can get a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.680" end="01:06:53.260" style="s2">different bigger picture it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.040" end="01:06:58.170" style="s2">way forward Garrett but I&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.260" end="01:07:02.080" style="s2">honest I feel like you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.170" end="01:07:05.020" style="s2">something is run into a wall and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.080" end="01:07:08.890" style="s2">the sense that like how could this</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.020" end="01:07:11.290" style="s2">beautiful structure not be not be right</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.890" end="01:07:15.070" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel to me like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.290" end="01:07:17.040" style="s2">insufficient yeah yeah and there but</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.070" end="01:07:20.290" style="s2">there there&#39;s there larger structures</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.040" end="01:07:23.710" style="s2">that are not finite dimensional but</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.290" end="01:07:25.180" style="s2">there&#39;s still Li groups and exceptional</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.710" end="01:07:26.380" style="s2">Li groups they&#39;re just generalized</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.180" end="01:07:29.050" style="s2">infinite dimensionally groups that</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.380" end="01:07:31.030" style="s2">contain ei tis a substructure and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.050" end="01:07:32.740" style="s2">they&#39;re beautiful they&#39;re just as</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.030" end="01:07:35.650" style="s2">beautiful if not more so I really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.740" end="01:07:37.480" style="s2">I think that the problem is is that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.650" end="01:07:42.280" style="s2">know we have this mutual friend sabine</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.480" end="01:07:47.230" style="s2">hassan Felder when sabine has this very</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.280" end="01:07:49.560" style="s2">strange feature of her personality that</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.230" end="01:07:52.950" style="s2">she needs to tell the truth it&#39;s scale</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.560" end="01:07:56.230" style="s2">well sabina is a scientist and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.950" end="01:07:57.240" style="s2">scientists you know engage in the truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.230" end="01:08:01.030" style="s2">at all costs</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.240" end="01:08:03.220" style="s2">yes but serve our modus operandi well I</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.030" end="01:08:05.470" style="s2">find it very interesting that almost no</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.220" end="01:08:06.550" style="s2">one has followed sabaeans lead I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.470" end="01:08:13.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a penis Abuna</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.550" end="01:08:17.110" style="s2">yeah okay from her perspective Beauty</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.510" end="01:08:21.340" style="s2">has led theoretical physics astray right</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.110" end="01:08:23.380" style="s2">now I&#39;ve I&#39;ve tangled with her my claim</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.340" end="01:08:26.980" style="s2">is is that the the string theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.380" end="01:08:29.380" style="s2">community which has generally hoovered</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.980" end="01:08:32.110" style="s2">up the most brilliant minds but turned</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.380" end="01:08:34.270" style="s2">them into kind of almost cult-like</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.110" end="01:08:36.340" style="s2">members which are exploring some</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.270" end="01:08:38.200" style="s2">structure but I just don&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.340" end="01:08:39.820" style="s2">similar to e8 in the sense that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.200" end="01:08:41.950" style="s2">positive that it&#39;s the structure of our</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.820" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">world it has some beauty and some</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.950" end="01:08:47.109" style="s2">consistency but I&#39;m not positive that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:50.429" style="s2">that&#39;s its reason for being</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.109" end="01:08:54.219" style="s2">and because that argument has been so</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.429" end="01:08:56.170" style="s2">abusive and it it&#39;s it&#39;s just been it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.219" end="01:08:58.299" style="s2">been abused against other people that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.170" end="01:09:00.040" style="s2">our work is beautiful and then when</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.299" end="01:09:01.330" style="s2">those Outsiders look at it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.040" end="01:09:04.719" style="s2">like what you&#39;re doing is that beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.330" end="01:09:06.969" style="s2">at all she&#39;s gone against beauty as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.719" end="01:09:10.630" style="s2">means of trying to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.969" end="01:09:12.969" style="s2">true and what what isn&#39;t I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.630" end="01:09:15.549" style="s2">that you&#39;re falling prey to the siren of</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.969" end="01:09:18.429" style="s2">beauty where you&#39;re not coupling you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.549" end="01:09:19.690" style="s2">not things that are beautiful that there</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.429" end="01:09:21.400" style="s2">are many things that are beautiful that</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.690" end="01:09:23.949" style="s2">don&#39;t exist to do what you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.400" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">there to do right well that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.949" end="01:09:29.710" style="s2">true I&#39;m definitely inspired by</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:31.119" style="s2">beautiful mathematical objects when I</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.710" end="01:09:33.400" style="s2">start exploring an area of mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.119" end="01:09:35.790" style="s2">and I start to see its intricacies and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.400" end="01:09:38.859" style="s2">it&#39;s connection to fundamental physics I</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.790" end="01:09:41.319" style="s2">am led to think that there might be</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.859" end="01:09:43.569" style="s2">something there based on aesthetics well</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.319" end="01:09:46.389" style="s2">and I and I&#39;ve also discussed this with</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.569" end="01:09:49.989" style="s2">Sabrina who I think is great her points</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.389" end="01:09:52.299" style="s2">are wonderful but I would be lost if I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.989" end="01:09:56.530" style="s2">didn&#39;t have this aesthetic sense as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.299" end="01:09:58.600" style="s2">guide well let&#39;s take an example like</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.530" end="01:10:01.150" style="s2">the hydrogen atom so you&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.600" end="01:10:03.670" style="s2">proton at the center of a hydrogen atom</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.150" end="01:10:06.340" style="s2">and you have all of the electron shells</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.670" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">in quantum theory that are generated by</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.340" end="01:10:16.920" style="s2">the Coulomb potential that comes off of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:20.739" style="s2">that nucleus right okay that story of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.920" end="01:10:25.810" style="s2">chemistry is just being these perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.739" end="01:10:28.840" style="s2">spherical electron shells works pretty</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.810" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">well by even the other orbitals young</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:31.840" style="s2">people&#39;s s over looking over a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:33.489" style="s2">these things yeah yeah in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.840" end="01:10:35.080" style="s2">representation theory of something we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.489" end="01:10:40.210" style="s2">call spin three that gives the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.080" end="01:10:44.770" style="s2">symmetries of the system that story is</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.210" end="01:10:47.199" style="s2">not it is absolutely beautiful and it</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.770" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">works pretty darn well but it starts to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.199" end="01:10:53.260" style="s2">fall apart the larger the atoms are and</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:55.869" style="s2">the more neutrons and protons are stuck</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.260" end="01:10:59.550" style="s2">together in the in the nucleus it gets</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.869" end="01:11:01.740" style="s2">much more subtle yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.550" end="01:11:03.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a perfectly beautiful story that</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.740" end="01:11:06.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t the right story it&#39;s not the true</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.810" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">story it&#39;s very close to a true story</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.330" end="01:11:12.120" style="s2">it&#39;s suggestive it&#39;s indicative but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:13.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t actually the true story itself so</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.120" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">you have to be very careful in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.830" end="01:11:19.680" style="s2">that you&#39;d you don&#39;t fall into the trap</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:22.830" style="s2">of thinking that the hydrogen atom sort</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.680" end="01:11:25.710" style="s2">of generalizes it&#39;s perfection is simply</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.830" end="01:11:28.740" style="s2">the story of chemistry right of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.710" end="01:11:30.930" style="s2">they&#39;re much more complex elements and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.740" end="01:11:32.430" style="s2">then grouped into molecules and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.930" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">all sorts of things that go into you</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.430" end="01:11:36.270" style="s2">into that sort of chemistry well but you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:38.510" style="s2">don&#39;t you have the same situation in</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.270" end="01:11:40.830" style="s2">theoretical physics where you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.510" end="01:11:44.460" style="s2">certain kinds of beauty that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.830" end="01:11:46.260" style="s2">incredibly pure that actually kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.460" end="01:11:50.940" style="s2">fall apart under scrutiny and you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.260" end="01:11:52.710" style="s2">other kinds of beauty that seem to fall</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.940" end="01:11:57.990" style="s2">apart but actually go the distance I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.710" end="01:12:00.630" style="s2">thinking about de Rock&#39;s discovery of</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.990" end="01:12:02.190" style="s2">antimatter is the corresponding</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.630" end="01:12:03.870" style="s2">solutions to the matter solution I</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.190" end="01:12:05.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t originally think that was that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.870" end="01:12:07.920" style="s2">the anti electrons were that were</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.940" end="01:12:10.010" style="s2">actually protons and they only knew of</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.920" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">those two particles and then Heisenberg</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.010" end="01:12:16.020" style="s2">tried to pop his bubble and said you</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:18.330" style="s2">know you actually have a new particle</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.020" end="01:12:22.410" style="s2">here well no he said that the proton was</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.330" end="01:12:25.740" style="s2">way too heavy to be the anti particle</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.410" end="01:12:28.470" style="s2">mirror of the electron and I think Dirac</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.740" end="01:12:30.240" style="s2">sort of recanted but Dirac should have</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.470" end="01:12:31.740" style="s2">had the courage of his convictions and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.240" end="01:12:35.130" style="s2">said I predict that there will be two</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.740" end="01:12:36.870" style="s2">new particles an antiproton and an anti</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.130" end="01:12:38.550" style="s2">electron which was called the positron</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.870" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">and both of those things turned out to</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.550" end="01:12:40.860" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:43.230" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s considered a victory for</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.860" end="01:12:45.240" style="s2">the aesthetic of beauty in mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.230" end="01:12:47.400" style="s2">physics yes but there was an</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.240" end="01:12:50.190" style="s2">intermediate there what situation in</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.400" end="01:12:53.190" style="s2">which the beauty led Dirac astray</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.190" end="01:12:56.520" style="s2">because he wanted to shoehorn</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.190" end="01:12:59.190" style="s2">his theory into the pre-existing world</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.520" end="01:13:01.620" style="s2">that was understood that&#39;s right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.190" end="01:13:03.600" style="s2">important to be cautious but and careful</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.620" end="01:13:05.010" style="s2">yeah but not too cautious so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.600" end="01:13:06.350" style="s2">if the mathematics is actually telling</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.010" end="01:13:09.960" style="s2">you something you want to listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.350" end="01:13:11.320" style="s2">what&#39;s the mathematics telling you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.960" end="01:13:14.679" style="s2">telling me that I think of</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.320" end="01:13:18.250" style="s2">got the first handle on a geometric</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.679" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">description of quantum field theory here</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.250" end="01:13:25.000" style="s2">I said I saw this out of love and I hope</p>

<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:32.679" style="s2">rather than just going to infinite</p>

<p begin="01:13:32.679" end="01:13:39.790" style="s2">theory requires a jump from finite to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.219" end="01:13:42.610" style="s2">infinite dimensions you can say look I I</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.790" end="01:13:45.670" style="s2">am fighting the fact that the the</p>

<p begin="01:13:45.670" end="01:13:51.190" style="s2">actually is going to be challenged at</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.090" end="01:13:55.239" style="s2">the quantum level where that beauty</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.190" end="01:13:55.599" style="s2">becomes my enemy I would never put it</p>

<p begin="01:13:55.599" end="01:14:01.869" style="s2">I know because what you did is you took</p>

<p begin="01:14:20.440" end="01:14:26.679" style="s2">isomorphism is equivalent to some other</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.929" end="01:14:29.409" style="s2">object surprisingly called su 4 and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.679" end="01:14:31.510" style="s2">can take the spinners of spin six and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.409" end="01:14:33.610" style="s2">find out that they are just the four</p>

<p begin="01:14:33.610" end="01:14:39.610" style="s2">and smush them together and you get an</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.010" end="01:14:41.349" style="s2">analog of eight yeah there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.610" end="01:14:43.570" style="s2">probably not used by the physical</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:51.460" style="s2">but they&#39;re a vast world of mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.570" end="01:14:53.920" style="s2">possibilities out here and I think we</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.460" end="01:14:56.710" style="s2">need more people might agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.920" end="01:14:58.510" style="s2">that we need more people fanning out and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.710" end="01:15:00.489" style="s2">trying things that look like they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.510" end="01:15:02.170" style="s2">work so we need a more exploratory cut</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.489" end="01:15:03.909" style="s2">we need a more exploratory culture and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.170" end="01:15:08.440" style="s2">we need to be forgiving what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.909" end="01:15:11.139" style="s2">need to do is to fool ourselves when we</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.440" end="01:15:13.869" style="s2">start getting the sense that maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.139" end="01:15:15.820" style="s2">stuff doesn&#39;t actually work I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.869" end="01:15:18.670" style="s2">just like it feels to me like I can sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.820" end="01:15:20.230" style="s2">of see what the next set of problems are</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.670" end="01:15:21.670" style="s2">gonna be and it would be I would be</p>

<p begin="01:15:21.670" end="01:15:26.920" style="s2">beginning sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.429" end="01:15:28.600" style="s2">but you know you can&#39;t really dig into</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.920" end="01:15:30.640" style="s2">this stuff until you see the</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.600" end="01:15:36.100" style="s2">mathematical details of it and this gets</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.640" end="01:15:38.170" style="s2">back to an issue of the question of how</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.100" end="01:15:40.980" style="s2">science should be organized so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.170" end="01:15:44.409" style="s2">talked about how difficult it is to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.980" end="01:15:48.550" style="s2">science inside of the institutions</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.409" end="01:15:50.469" style="s2">because there is such a pressure</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.550" end="01:15:52.750" style="s2">economically to do whatever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.469" end="01:15:56.440" style="s2">fashionable to get lots of results to</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.750" end="01:16:00.460" style="s2">publish continuously can we talk a</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.440" end="01:16:02.170" style="s2">little bit about what happens when we</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.460" end="01:16:05.080" style="s2">try to do science outside of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.170" end="01:16:06.790" style="s2">institutions both of us have and I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.080" end="01:16:11.830" style="s2">people will be very surprised to hear it</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.790" end="01:16:14.320" style="s2">been rather critical of how hard it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.830" end="01:16:17.380" style="s2">to do science when you&#39;re not part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.320" end="01:16:19.750" style="s2">the standard community right I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.380" end="01:16:22.570" style="s2">think in some sense it is essential to</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.750" end="01:16:23.770" style="s2">say to stay connected with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.570" end="01:16:26.770" style="s2">scientific community even when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.770" end="01:16:30.429" style="s2">exploring out almost entirely on your</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.770" end="01:16:32.739" style="s2">own you one thing that has to happen is</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.429" end="01:16:37.380" style="s2">you have to have an extreme set of</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.739" end="01:16:39.699" style="s2">internal checks on your own progress and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.380" end="01:16:41.230" style="s2">because it science is extremely</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.699" end="01:16:43.090" style="s2">frustrating to work on most of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.230" end="01:16:45.340" style="s2">pathways you follow out or end up being</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.090" end="01:16:49.449" style="s2">dead ends and it can be really</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.340" end="01:16:52.150" style="s2">frustrating so in doing that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.449" end="01:16:54.969" style="s2">gonna work outside academia you also</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.150" end="01:16:58.120" style="s2">need a extremely strong support system</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.969" end="01:17:00.460" style="s2">and a healthy life independent of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.120" end="01:17:02.290" style="s2">science you&#39;re working on so you need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.460" end="01:17:06.219" style="s2">have good support from friends and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.290" end="01:17:08.469" style="s2">family good relationships you need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.219" end="01:17:10.900" style="s2">have confidence and your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.469" end="01:17:12.699" style="s2">support yourself and and that frees up</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.900" end="01:17:15.210" style="s2">your time if you&#39;re really gonna work on</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.699" end="01:17:18.340" style="s2">stuff outside of academia on your own</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.210" end="01:17:20.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to build into</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.340" end="01:17:22.540" style="s2">and to have those things I feel really</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.050" end="01:17:24.219" style="s2">lucky to be able to do that and I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.540" end="01:17:27.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a really good life that way</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.219" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">and but if you&#39;re gonna do that you need</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.909" end="01:17:31.330" style="s2">to be really careful about it because if</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:32.770" style="s2">you if you if you just abandon</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.330" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">everything else because you have this</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.770" end="01:17:37.239" style="s2">idea in science that you want to pursue</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:38.079" style="s2">and you abandon everything else you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.239" end="01:17:41.199" style="s2">be totally</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.079" end="01:17:43.389" style="s2">out of balance in your life and if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.199" end="01:17:44.980" style="s2">hit some frustrating item and what</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.389" end="01:17:48.190" style="s2">you&#39;re researching</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.980" end="01:17:49.929" style="s2">it&#39;ll be crushing because the main thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.190" end="01:17:52.570" style="s2">you&#39;re working on focused on stopped</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.929" end="01:17:54.010" style="s2">working when really what you want be</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.570" end="01:17:56.050" style="s2">able to do is like oh I&#39;ve got other</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.010" end="01:17:58.329" style="s2">stuff going on that&#39;s keeping me happy</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.050" end="01:18:01.119" style="s2">this thing didn&#39;t work out I just have</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.329" end="01:18:03.400" style="s2">to wipe the board clean and start fresh</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.119" end="01:18:05.469" style="s2">and that&#39;s not devastating to do because</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.400" end="01:18:07.090" style="s2">the rest of your life is good you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.469" end="01:18:09.670" style="s2">to do that otherwise you just won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.090" end="01:18:11.889" style="s2">healthy as a human being okay and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.670" end="01:18:15.550" style="s2">have created something that you think</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.889" end="01:18:18.820" style="s2">might be an intermediate between being</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.550" end="01:18:22.300" style="s2">in total isolation and being hooked up</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.820" end="01:18:24.429" style="s2">to the community that lives within it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.300" end="01:18:26.949" style="s2">the standard institutional stress right</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.429" end="01:18:29.320" style="s2">that&#39;s right I mean I&#39;ve I came to this</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.949" end="01:18:30.969" style="s2">idea when I was wandering from friend&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.320" end="01:18:33.760" style="s2">house to friend&#39;s house after getting my</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.969" end="01:18:35.500" style="s2">PhD I would basically go hang out with a</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.760" end="01:18:38.020" style="s2">friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.500" end="01:18:39.369" style="s2">it had extra space I spend time in their</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.020" end="01:18:40.510" style="s2">house while I worked on theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.369" end="01:18:42.429" style="s2">physics and enjoyed the local</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.510" end="01:18:43.750" style="s2">environment and I thought was great to</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.429" end="01:18:45.400" style="s2">be able to do this cuz you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.750" end="01:18:47.559" style="s2">worried about you know having a roof</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.400" end="01:18:49.389" style="s2">over your head you have company to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.559" end="01:18:52.030" style="s2">interact with and you have a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.389" end="01:18:54.250" style="s2">environment to play in and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.030" end="01:18:55.449" style="s2">have a network of such places but I had</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.250" end="01:18:57.730" style="s2">a hard time getting friends to give me</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.449" end="01:18:59.739" style="s2">their houses to use for this so I ended</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.730" end="01:19:02.710" style="s2">up getting the resources together to buy</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.739" end="01:19:04.989" style="s2">a house in Maui and and to start</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.710" end="01:19:08.079" style="s2">bringing friends and visiting scientists</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.989" end="01:19:10.599" style="s2">in and I&#39;ve called this the Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.079" end="01:19:12.699" style="s2">Science Institute and currently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.599" end="01:19:15.250" style="s2">basically my house with delusions of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.699" end="01:19:18.190" style="s2">grandeur because what I also have is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.250" end="01:19:20.409" style="s2">is a beautiful piece of property that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.190" end="01:19:21.699" style="s2">15 acres that I&#39;ve bought 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.409" end="01:19:23.500" style="s2">because I like doing things slowly</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.699" end="01:19:25.329" style="s2">mm-hmm so I&#39;ve been growing the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.500" end="01:19:27.309" style="s2">community of the Pacific Science</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.329" end="01:19:30.730" style="s2">Institute by having friends come in and</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.309" end="01:19:32.409" style="s2">stay at my house including you and my</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.730" end="01:19:35.380" style="s2">arts night assist I had a great time</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.409" end="01:19:37.239" style="s2">despite the obvious antagonism and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.380" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">for you specifically I tried to kill you</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.239" end="01:19:42.099" style="s2">in several different ways with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:43.989" style="s2">millipedes instead of yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.099" end="01:19:47.349" style="s2">shark-infested water yeah sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.989" end="01:19:49.199" style="s2">great rough corals but but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.349" end="01:19:50.999" style="s2">basically I&#39;ve scientists visit</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.199" end="01:19:52.650" style="s2">and take people out to have fun around</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.999" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">the island and really enjoy a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.650" end="01:19:59.099" style="s2">environment where they&#39;re free to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:20:01.590" style="s2">explore ideas that might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.099" end="01:20:03.420" style="s2">on the dangerous side to work on while</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.590" end="01:20:05.429" style="s2">they&#39;re in the confines of academia and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.420" end="01:20:06.570" style="s2">among their normal colleagues it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.429" end="01:20:10.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a place where you can explore a</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.570" end="01:20:13.199" style="s2">little bit Wilder ideas and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.170" end="01:20:15.269" style="s2">excited to grow this community by by</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.199" end="01:20:16.860" style="s2">starting to design things to build on</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.269" end="01:20:19.590" style="s2">the 15 acres I&#39;ve got that&#39;s really in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.860" end="01:20:20.940" style="s2">nice location so I&#39;ve been growing</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.590" end="01:20:22.559" style="s2">things slowly up here and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.940" end="01:20:25.079" style="s2">looking forward to some more progress</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.559" end="01:20:28.170" style="s2">with it and grind this community it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.079" end="01:20:29.729" style="s2">its it&#39;s also been a nice balance</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.170" end="01:20:32.309" style="s2">against working on physics directly</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.729" end="01:20:35.219" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s guaranteed success I</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.309" end="01:20:36.510" style="s2">mean when you have a place in Maui for</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.219" end="01:20:38.130" style="s2">scientists to come hang out and have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.510" end="01:20:40.619" style="s2">good time that&#39;s that&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.130" end="01:20:41.909" style="s2">and also keeps me entertained to have</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.619" end="01:20:46.860" style="s2">good people coming through that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.909" end="01:20:49.409" style="s2">fantastic so yeah yourself can you just</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.860" end="01:20:53.880" style="s2">I&#39;m curious from your perspective how do</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.409" end="01:20:57.119" style="s2">you see the two of us as being divided</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.880" end="01:21:01.079" style="s2">in our approaches to the community I</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.119" end="01:21:04.469" style="s2">would definitely say that I I seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.079" end="01:21:08.280" style="s2">more connected to the sensibilities of</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.469" end="01:21:10.409" style="s2">the elite science community I know that</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.280" end="01:21:12.989" style="s2">I can get their noses out of joint but</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.409" end="01:21:15.050" style="s2">I&#39;m attacked them very carefully yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.989" end="01:21:17.159" style="s2">you had a lot fights with those guys</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.050" end="01:21:20.510" style="s2">okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.159" end="01:21:23.699" style="s2">whereas I I didn&#39;t so my our academic</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.510" end="01:21:25.260" style="s2">lineages are quite different I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.699" end="01:21:27.499" style="s2">went I went to a smaller school I went</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.260" end="01:21:30.389" style="s2">to UC San Diego I didn&#39;t go to Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.499" end="01:21:32.820" style="s2">but you know my advisor there in</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.389" end="01:21:34.829" style="s2">particle physics was Roger Dashon but he</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.820" end="01:21:37.619" style="s2">he passed away was a graduate student</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.829" end="01:21:39.179" style="s2">and I finished up my dissertation under</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.619" end="01:21:40.499" style="s2">under Henry Barban who also had a</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.179" end="01:21:43.979" style="s2">background in particle physics but it</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.499" end="01:21:46.170" style="s2">changed in nonlinear dynamics but in</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.979" end="01:21:47.849" style="s2">some sense you were a self advised PhD</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.170" end="01:21:49.920" style="s2">yeah so I was very much self-directed</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.849" end="01:21:51.570" style="s2">Henry gave me the freedom to go explore</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.920" end="01:21:53.340" style="s2">whatever the heck I wanted I had an</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.570" end="01:21:56.099" style="s2">extraordinary extraordinary amount of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.340" end="01:21:57.900" style="s2">freedom as a graduate student and I hit</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.099" end="01:21:59.219" style="s2">this problem with spinners and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.900" end="01:22:00.599" style="s2">what I wanted to tackle I want figure</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.219" end="01:22:02.000" style="s2">out what they were geometrically and no</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.599" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">one else was interested in that problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.000" end="01:22:05.870" style="s2">but through academia I was a straight-a</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:07.580" style="s2">student you know I did really well I</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.870" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">never had any big conflicts was an easy</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.580" end="01:22:11.720" style="s2">round yeah it was I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:13.520" style="s2">surfing I was living on the beach in La</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.720" end="01:22:15.440" style="s2">Jolla is beautiful is the greatest time</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.520" end="01:22:18.620" style="s2">in my life okay you know people talk</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.440" end="01:22:20.450" style="s2">about you know a small you know being in</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.620" end="01:22:22.250" style="s2">a small pot big fish in a small pond and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.450" end="01:22:24.050" style="s2">going to a bigger pond you feel humbled</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.250" end="01:22:27.590" style="s2">I never really had that experience I was</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.050" end="01:22:30.020" style="s2">I was pretty pretty close to the top of</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.590" end="01:22:31.520" style="s2">my class and really happy about it how</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.020" end="01:22:34.490" style="s2">everything was going everything was</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.520" end="01:22:37.070" style="s2">great I got my PhD but there was no way</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.490" end="01:22:39.620" style="s2">I was going to get a job trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.070" end="01:22:40.930" style="s2">understand the geometry of spinors when</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.620" end="01:22:43.130" style="s2">everybody else was doing string theory</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.930" end="01:22:44.420" style="s2">so you had already accepted that you</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.130" end="01:22:46.370" style="s2">were unemployable yeah I was totally</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.420" end="01:22:48.170" style="s2">unemployable but I invested in Apple</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.370" end="01:22:49.880" style="s2">stock in the 90s so I had a few money so</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.170" end="01:22:51.080" style="s2">I said see you guys let me go surf in</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.880" end="01:22:52.310" style="s2">Maui and work on the stuff on my own</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.080" end="01:22:53.930" style="s2">whereas you had a very different</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.310" end="01:22:56.360" style="s2">experience so you were you were in</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.930" end="01:22:58.940" style="s2">Harvard in the math department but</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.360" end="01:23:00.560" style="s2">studying mathematical physics and as far</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.940" end="01:23:01.790" style="s2">as I know you were making some really</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.560" end="01:23:04.310" style="s2">unusual breakthroughs that were very</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.790" end="01:23:07.340" style="s2">ahead of their time but you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.310" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">welcomed by the the head of the PETA</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.340" end="01:23:11.780" style="s2">they had people there and so you said</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:14.000" style="s2">yet you had a conflict from the get-go</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.780" end="01:23:16.940" style="s2">well I had a very I had a very serious</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.000" end="01:23:18.950" style="s2">dispute about something in mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.940" end="01:23:21.500" style="s2">which were called the self-dual</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.950" end="01:23:23.120" style="s2">equations self-dual yang-mills equations</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.500" end="01:23:25.040" style="s2">which were related to the regular</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.120" end="01:23:28.390" style="s2">yang-mills equations which are the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.040" end="01:23:31.310" style="s2">equations of force in the standard model</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.390" end="01:23:33.860" style="s2">but the self-dual yang-mills equations</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.310" end="01:23:38.450" style="s2">were sort of a square root of those</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.860" end="01:23:41.420" style="s2">equations and they were very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.450" end="01:23:46.190" style="s2">to work with and to solve and I was very</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.420" end="01:23:49.160" style="s2">confused as to why people were investing</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.190" end="01:23:51.590" style="s2">in this particular form of these</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.160" end="01:23:54.440" style="s2">equations when it felt to me that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.590" end="01:23:57.290" style="s2">hadn&#39;t asked what constellation of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.440" end="01:24:00.760" style="s2">equations these new equations belong to</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.290" end="01:24:06.590" style="s2">and I had proposed again spinners as a</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.760" end="01:24:09.440" style="s2">means of changing the equations and was</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.590" end="01:24:11.480" style="s2">told that if I mean the exact quote was</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:14.240" style="s2">something like if spinners had anything</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.480" end="01:24:15.369" style="s2">to do with the story Nigel who is Nigel</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.240" end="01:24:19.550" style="s2">Hitchin would have told</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.369" end="01:24:21.170" style="s2">like it was just completely yeah it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.550" end="01:24:23.900" style="s2">bananas and then I got into this issue</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.170" end="01:24:26.810" style="s2">that well you know spinners have to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.900" end="01:24:30.130" style="s2">quantized as fermions that is they have</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.810" end="01:24:32.869" style="s2">to be treated as if they were matter</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.130" end="01:24:35.960" style="s2">inside of quantum field theory but this</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.869" end="01:24:37.010" style="s2">was not like we weren&#39;t doing quantum</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.960" end="01:24:39.920" style="s2">field theory we were just doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.010" end="01:24:42.230" style="s2">classical geometry of a kind and so none</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.920" end="01:24:45.500" style="s2">of the arguments I put forward the set</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.230" end="01:24:47.449" style="s2">of equations which later got recognized</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.500" end="01:24:48.770" style="s2">and completely changed the field which</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.449" end="01:24:51.949" style="s2">came through ed Witten and this guy</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.770" end="01:24:55.849" style="s2">called Nattie sy Berg both of them now</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.949" end="01:24:59.989" style="s2">professors at the Institute and there</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.849" end="01:25:01.880" style="s2">was just no room to question why</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.989" end="01:25:04.969" style="s2">everybody was struggling with these</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.880" end="01:25:06.710" style="s2">almost intractable equations and just</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.969" end="01:25:09.409" style="s2">you know getting great results but with</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.710" end="01:25:15.230" style="s2">so much effort and work so that was like</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.409" end="01:25:18.469" style="s2">a very weird story whereby you know I</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.230" end="01:25:20.119" style="s2">think that by 1994 the Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.469" end="01:25:22.579" style="s2">Department had woken up to the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.119" end="01:25:24.290" style="s2">it was not using the right equations and</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.579" end="01:25:28.730" style="s2">I&#39;d been actually proposing several sets</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.290" end="01:25:32.659" style="s2">of different equations but that you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.730" end="01:25:36.619" style="s2">when this all you know came about late</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.659" end="01:25:38.719" style="s2">late 80s early 90s there was just no way</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.619" end="01:25:41.329" style="s2">to to have a productive conversation</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.719" end="01:25:43.040" style="s2">about it right so you found yourself at</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.329" end="01:25:44.810" style="s2">odds with the the people you were</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.040" end="01:25:46.520" style="s2">talking with and you decided to go into</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.810" end="01:25:50.449" style="s2">finance instead or how&#39;d that happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.520" end="01:25:55.579" style="s2">no I mean I I wanted I was trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.449" end="01:25:58.429" style="s2">back to physics and the you know I was</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.579" end="01:26:02.090" style="s2">proposing I&#39;d propose three sets of</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.429" end="01:26:03.650" style="s2">equations one of which it turned out to</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.090" end="01:26:05.119" style="s2">have been done by somebody else and</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.650" end="01:26:09.170" style="s2">someplace that I had didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.119" end="01:26:13.190" style="s2">anything about one of which later gets</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.170" end="01:26:17.090" style="s2">done by cybergun Witten and then another</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.190" end="01:26:21.130" style="s2">set of equations that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.090" end="01:26:23.630" style="s2">connect to the actual standard model and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.130" end="01:26:27.050" style="s2">the the department was just very</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.630" end="01:26:28.910" style="s2">concerned that this didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.050" end="01:26:30.620" style="s2">anything to do with actual physics</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.910" end="01:26:32.660" style="s2">it was sort of a coincidence in their</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.620" end="01:26:35.390" style="s2">mind that something that was vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.660" end="01:26:38.180" style="s2">physics II was having great topological</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.390" end="01:26:40.310" style="s2">results and so there was this you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.180" end="01:26:42.740" style="s2">this fear and I was sent to a guy named</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.310" end="01:26:45.500" style="s2">Sidney Coleman who was a great quantum</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.740" end="01:26:47.420" style="s2">theorists and he was much more</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.500" end="01:26:49.460" style="s2">encouraging than the Harvard math</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.420" end="01:26:51.620" style="s2">departments any Coleman&#39;s a great guy I</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.460" end="01:26:53.450" style="s2">mean an unbelievable human being I had</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.620" end="01:26:56.330" style="s2">two memories of him one of which was</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.450" end="01:26:57.950" style="s2">that he had all the time in the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.330" end="01:26:59.300" style="s2">for people who had no idea what they</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.950" end="01:27:01.610" style="s2">were doing and the other was that he</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.300" end="01:27:02.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t suffer fools gladly and then I</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.610" end="01:27:05.840" style="s2">realized that those are two</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.390" end="01:27:08.090" style="s2">contradictory images I unearthed old</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.840" end="01:27:10.100" style="s2">footage of him he gave this brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.090" end="01:27:12.650" style="s2">lecture called quantum mechanics in your</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.100" end="01:27:13.850" style="s2">face to try to make the quantum have you</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.650" end="01:27:16.450" style="s2">ever seen this thing I&#39;ve know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.850" end="01:27:18.890" style="s2">work of art you&#39;d love it</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.450" end="01:27:21.800" style="s2">and it turns out both of these things</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.890" end="01:27:23.570" style="s2">were really true about him that he he</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.800" end="01:27:25.490" style="s2">had if you were full of yourself and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.570" end="01:27:27.950" style="s2">were wrong he would just cut you up into</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.490" end="01:27:29.450" style="s2">little pieces but if you said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.950" end="01:27:30.950" style="s2">quite understand this he had all the</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.450" end="01:27:35.030" style="s2">time in the world to be the greatest of</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.950" end="01:27:40.040" style="s2">teachers no I mean one of the marks of a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.030" end="01:27:42.680" style="s2">good scientist is humility you know know</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.040" end="01:27:44.810" style="s2">one of the marks of a good science is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.680" end="01:27:47.030" style="s2">dialectic between arrogance and humility</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.810" end="01:27:48.440" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that&#39;s a more subtle</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.030" end="01:27:51.110" style="s2">and accurate way of putting it yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.440" end="01:27:53.540" style="s2">no I just I worry about us extolling the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.110" end="01:27:55.970" style="s2">virtues of the humble the mean right</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.540" end="01:27:57.770" style="s2">the self effacing it&#39;s just like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.970" end="01:27:59.180" style="s2">not where the magic happens yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.770" end="01:28:01.400" style="s2">but you have to have had the arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.180" end="01:28:04.030" style="s2">to tackle hard problems right and made</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.400" end="01:28:06.170" style="s2">some progress but then been kicked back</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.030" end="01:28:07.400" style="s2">by something didn&#39;t work right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.170" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">after enough of that you develop some</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.400" end="01:28:11.990" style="s2">humility but you still have to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.960" end="01:28:14.420" style="s2">the arrogance to get anywhere so how do</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.990" end="01:28:16.370" style="s2">you feel currently about about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.420" end="01:28:17.930" style="s2">community like the professional</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.370" end="01:28:26.150" style="s2">community you have to know that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.930" end="01:28:27.800" style="s2">regard you with very I mean well I know</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.150" end="01:28:30.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I mean there&#39;s I got a</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.800" end="01:28:32.510" style="s2">lot of contempt from string theorists</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.290" end="01:28:34.790" style="s2">forgetting forgetting attention for</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.510" end="01:28:38.570" style="s2">putting forward a mathematical model of</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.790" end="01:28:41.149" style="s2">reality that wasn&#39;t strings and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.570" end="01:28:43.489" style="s2">wasn&#39;t complete</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.149" end="01:28:45.619" style="s2">was it had is a model that was proposed</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.489" end="01:28:47.149" style="s2">that had problems with it and I was</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.619" end="01:28:48.800" style="s2">forthcoming with the problems in it but</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.149" end="01:28:50.329" style="s2">I was still saying yeah this is this</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.800" end="01:28:51.949" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s making progress towards</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.329" end="01:28:54.079" style="s2">the description reality and has nothing</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.949" end="01:28:55.969" style="s2">to do with strings and that said alarm</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.079" end="01:28:58.219" style="s2">bells off all over the place it set off</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.969" end="01:28:59.629" style="s2">alarm bells for either it&#39;s a threat or</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.219" end="01:29:02.539" style="s2">this guy&#39;s a complete crackpot which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.629" end="01:29:06.349" style="s2">more likely and and I got criticisms</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.539" end="01:29:08.059" style="s2">from but for both don&#39;t think if I were</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.349" end="01:29:10.939" style="s2">to steal me in their perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.059" end="01:29:13.999" style="s2">again you know that I don&#39;t share it and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.939" end="01:29:18.829" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to fight them and I as I did</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.999" end="01:29:20.989" style="s2">when you first encountered when I called</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.829" end="01:29:22.099" style="s2">their immune system in a gentleman known</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.989" end="01:29:25.249" style="s2">as Jacques dis lair</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.099" end="01:29:26.899" style="s2">right I&#39;m willing to stand up for what</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.249" end="01:29:28.780" style="s2">it is you&#39;re trying to do but I do think</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.899" end="01:29:32.209" style="s2">that we have to give them their due</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.780" end="01:29:35.689" style="s2">before we say what&#39;s wrong with their</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.209" end="01:29:38.239" style="s2">perspective their perspective is there</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.689" end="01:29:41.479" style="s2">are lots of constraints that one learns</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.239" end="01:29:43.340" style="s2">are very difficult to evade when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.479" end="01:29:47.149" style="s2">immerse yourself in standard quantum</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.340" end="01:29:49.939" style="s2">field theory like they know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.149" end="01:29:52.999" style="s2">that is demotivating them it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.939" end="01:29:56.869" style="s2">no-go theorems and the the intricacies</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.999" end="01:29:59.749" style="s2">and the reason they got crazy about</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.869" end="01:30:03.439" style="s2">string theory first of all I&#39;m convinced</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.749" end="01:30:05.329" style="s2">that it was a way of evading the real</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.439" end="01:30:07.729" style="s2">problems in physics it gave them</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.329" end="01:30:10.340" style="s2">something to do it&#39;s like like wargames</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.729" end="01:30:12.590" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing period piece well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.340" end="01:30:14.329" style="s2">it gives you something to do to keep</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.590" end="01:30:18.369" style="s2">your chops up that is different from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.329" end="01:30:18.369" style="s2">thing you&#39;re supposed to be doing and</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.729" end="01:30:25.010" style="s2">what they were objecting to is to say</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.159" end="01:30:27.229" style="s2">this guy doesn&#39;t understand all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.010" end="01:30:29.360" style="s2">things that have to go right in order to</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.229" end="01:30:33.789" style="s2">do it in a have an improvement on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.360" end="01:30:36.979" style="s2">theory from our perspective how dare he</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.789" end="01:30:41.239" style="s2">blithely saunter forth if we ignored all</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.979" end="01:30:43.039" style="s2">the constraints on us we could have fun</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.239" end="01:30:45.110" style="s2">proposing all sorts of things that also</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.039" end="01:30:47.300" style="s2">won&#39;t work that was really the</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.110" end="01:30:49.699" style="s2">responsible version of their critique</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.300" end="01:30:51.169" style="s2">now the irresponsible version of their</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.699" end="01:30:52.669" style="s2">critique is hey we have something that</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.169" end="01:30:54.770" style="s2">isn&#39;t working very well</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.669" end="01:30:56.420" style="s2">how dare he takes on</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.770" end="01:30:59.090" style="s2">thing that isn&#39;t working very well and</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.420" end="01:31:01.730" style="s2">get attention all right and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.090" end="01:31:03.920" style="s2">funding or maybe destroy the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.730" end="01:31:07.430" style="s2">there&#39;s only one game in town right and</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.920" end="01:31:09.620" style="s2">you know I was separately lobbying you</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.430" end="01:31:12.320" style="s2">and them for different things I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.620" end="01:31:13.760" style="s2">you to just say the words like I</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.320" end="01:31:16.370" style="s2">understand these are the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.760" end="01:31:18.320" style="s2">that will have to be satisfied and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.370" end="01:31:20.060" style="s2">don&#39;t have answers and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.320" end="01:31:21.590" style="s2">difficult they&#39;ll be to find but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.060" end="01:31:24.530" style="s2">want to be demotivated from the get-go</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.590" end="01:31:26.150" style="s2">so please don&#39;t immediately tell me all</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.530" end="01:31:28.370" style="s2">the no-go theorems because any</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.150" end="01:31:30.530" style="s2">successful theory will probably have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.370" end="01:31:32.090" style="s2">have a period where it&#39;s flying in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.530" end="01:31:33.950" style="s2">face of no go with you so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.090" end="01:31:35.630" style="s2">wanted to hear from you right I believe</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.950" end="01:31:37.760" style="s2">I said those things scattered over</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.630" end="01:31:40.040" style="s2">several interviews at the time somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.760" end="01:31:42.350" style="s2">but I think that I I think that what</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.040" end="01:31:47.330" style="s2">they don&#39;t Intuit is that you understand</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.350" end="01:31:50.720" style="s2">how how significant the negative results</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.330" end="01:31:53.540" style="s2">are the no-go theorems as they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.720" end="01:31:55.010" style="s2">are pretty profound right now I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.540" end="01:31:56.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a theorem called the Coleman</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.010" end="01:31:57.680" style="s2">medulla theorem that prohibits the</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.360" end="01:31:59.780" style="s2">unification of gravity with the other</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.680" end="01:32:01.700" style="s2">forces I just blew right through that</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.780" end="01:32:05.540" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t seem to apply in what</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.700" end="01:32:09.620" style="s2">I was doing well it I mean really it</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.540" end="01:32:13.220" style="s2">prohibits naive unification of matter</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.620" end="01:32:15.260" style="s2">and force and there&#39;s a way of evading</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.220" end="01:32:19.280" style="s2">it using this thing called supersymmetry</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.260" end="01:32:22.150" style="s2">and supersymmetry is this very weird</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:25.040" style="s2">thing that doesn&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.150" end="01:32:26.840" style="s2">mathematical beauty behind it so the</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.040" end="01:32:28.880" style="s2">mathematicians know about it they study</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.840" end="01:32:31.760" style="s2">it a little bit but they&#39;re not bananas</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.880" end="01:32:34.190" style="s2">over yeah I&#39;m not either the natural</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.760" end="01:32:36.730" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t seem to use it in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.190" end="01:32:40.370" style="s2">expected way but it does so much for</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.730" end="01:32:42.830" style="s2">theoretical physics that despite the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.370" end="01:32:44.690" style="s2">fact that math is just kind of ho-hum on</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.830" end="01:32:47.270" style="s2">it and that the natural world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.690" end="01:32:50.260" style="s2">seem to be using it it doesn&#39;t stop the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.270" end="01:32:52.670" style="s2">theoretical physics community from</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.260" end="01:32:56.300" style="s2">embracing that because it evades this</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.670" end="01:32:57.080" style="s2">dreaded no go it&#39;s not me from from</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.300" end="01:32:59.360" style="s2">embracing it</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.080" end="01:33:01.820" style="s2">I never embraced supersymmetry I never I</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.360" end="01:33:03.140" style="s2">never liked it but you didn&#39;t evade the</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.820" end="01:33:06.530" style="s2">problem with it either</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.140" end="01:33:08.000" style="s2">I mean it got around it you think you</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.530" end="01:33:08.560" style="s2">really got around it the common men do</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.000" end="01:33:10.570" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.560" end="01:33:12.250" style="s2">it requires as one of its axioms that</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.570" end="01:33:13.450" style="s2">you have to have you know certain you</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.250" end="01:33:15.520" style="s2">talked about properties of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.450" end="01:33:16.900" style="s2">scattering of particles and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.520" end="01:33:19.180" style="s2">have a spacetime of the scattering</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.900" end="01:33:20.800" style="s2">occurs and in the theory I put forward</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.180" end="01:33:22.390" style="s2">the space-time comes out after the</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.800" end="01:33:25.450" style="s2">symmetry breaking between gravity and</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.390" end="01:33:27.820" style="s2">forces so it&#39;s only after the symmetry</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.450" end="01:33:29.620" style="s2">breaking happens when the unification is</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.820" end="01:33:32.170" style="s2">no longer there yeah I&#39;m sure you have</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.620" end="01:33:34.210" style="s2">space-time I don&#39;t then in that context</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.170" end="01:33:36.220" style="s2">that theorem applies my guess making it</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.210" end="01:33:37.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but my guess is and then I could</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.220" end="01:33:38.440" style="s2">be wrong about this because I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.270" end="01:33:41.170" style="s2">studied exactly what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.440" end="01:33:44.560" style="s2">about that what&#39;s gonna happen is that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.170" end="01:33:46.360" style="s2">even with how you you claim this arises</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.560" end="01:33:48.580" style="s2">in your theory they&#39;re gonna say in</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.360" end="01:33:50.890" style="s2">whatever approximation is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.580" end="01:33:54.940" style="s2">applied to relatively flat space times</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.890" end="01:33:57.520" style="s2">close to Minkowski space yeah that if</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.940" end="01:33:58.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve really evaded it in some super</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.520" end="01:34:02.110" style="s2">meaningful way you should be able to</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.900" end="01:34:04.720" style="s2">tell us some theorems about good old</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.110" end="01:34:08.050" style="s2">quantum field theory and relatively flat</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.720" end="01:34:10.240" style="s2">space-time right well I mean it evades</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.050" end="01:34:13.510" style="s2">it by not satisfying the axioms of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.240" end="01:34:17.800" style="s2">theorem you do you know what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.510" end="01:34:20.320" style="s2">to get it it&#39;s not evading it in some</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.800" end="01:34:25.060" style="s2">you should be able to tell us something</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.320" end="01:34:29.170" style="s2">really new if you&#39;ve if your underlying</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.060" end="01:34:33.160" style="s2">theory mmm truly unifies force and</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.170" end="01:34:37.140" style="s2">matter right it would be the case that</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.160" end="01:34:40.900" style="s2">the approximation of it that is found in</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.140" end="01:34:43.360" style="s2">ordinary regions that look close to flat</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.900" end="01:34:46.090" style="s2">right where quantum the usual rules of</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.360" end="01:34:48.100" style="s2">quantum field theory apply it should be</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.090" end="01:34:50.580" style="s2">telling us something wildly new about</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.100" end="01:34:54.040" style="s2">that can you tell us a new theorem about</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.580" end="01:34:58.390" style="s2">how it would appeared to unify force and</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.040" end="01:35:00.970" style="s2">matter in a region that looks close to</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.390" end="01:35:03.190" style="s2">classical quantum field theory to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.970" end="01:35:04.780" style="s2">standard quantum fit well I mean once</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.190" end="01:35:06.610" style="s2">the theories advanced to the stage where</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.780" end="01:35:08.140" style="s2">you can get to that description yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.610" end="01:35:09.970" style="s2">then that would happened but in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.140" end="01:35:11.800" style="s2">initial stages all you can see for</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.970" end="01:35:14.920" style="s2">certain is that it&#39;s not violating the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.800" end="01:35:17.290" style="s2">theorem I don&#39;t know enough about all</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.920" end="01:35:21.940" style="s2">right how we talk about it after this ok</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.290" end="01:35:24.280" style="s2">night sure but but anyway so so those</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.940" end="01:35:27.040" style="s2">my I had these wishes for you and then I</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.280" end="01:35:28.750" style="s2">had the wishes for the community which</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.040" end="01:35:29.800" style="s2">is that they would stop being pricks</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.750" end="01:35:33.430" style="s2">about the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.800" end="01:35:35.020" style="s2">and that they would say look we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.430" end="01:35:37.960" style="s2">keep telling everybody who&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.020" end="01:35:40.360" style="s2">string theory string theorist that their</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.960" end="01:35:43.080" style="s2">theory is dead on arrival and keep</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.360" end="01:35:46.660" style="s2">saying while we know that our theory</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.080" end="01:35:48.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t appear to be living in four</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.660" end="01:35:49.330" style="s2">dimensions and appears to have a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.040" end="01:35:50.380" style="s2">of stuff that we don&#39;t want and not</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.330" end="01:35:52.570" style="s2">necessarily all the stuff that we do</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.380" end="01:35:55.090" style="s2">want and maybe there&#39;s a huge landscape</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.570" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">of different theories that would yeah at</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.090" end="01:35:57.820" style="s2">this point I don&#39;t think string theory</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:35:59.350" style="s2">is living at all I think it&#39;s an X</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.820" end="01:36:00.870" style="s2">theory I think it&#39;s pining for the</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.350" end="01:36:03.280" style="s2">fjords</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.870" end="01:36:05.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen nothing but decline since I</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.280" end="01:36:07.420" style="s2">left this train wreck well this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.080" end="01:36:09.550" style="s2">prodding is it refuses to take stock of</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.420" end="01:36:12.130" style="s2">itself and it took a lot more minds than</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.550" end="01:36:13.719" style="s2">one I think that&#39;s happening yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.130" end="01:36:16.810" style="s2">certainly the graduate students who are</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.719" end="01:36:18.310" style="s2">coming up are seeing what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.810" end="01:36:19.690" style="s2">with string theory and they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.310" end="01:36:21.310" style="s2">stock of the field and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.690" end="01:36:21.820" style="s2">another dress so where where do we go</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.310" end="01:36:26.050" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.820" end="01:36:28.270" style="s2">like well is there any way I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.050" end="01:36:31.300" style="s2">actually view it as highly demotivating</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.270" end="01:36:33.219" style="s2">then in essence every new theory is dead</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.300" end="01:36:35.560" style="s2">on arrival because of the number of</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.219" end="01:36:38.199" style="s2">things I mean can we agree that physics</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.560" end="01:36:40.900" style="s2">has gotten incredibly difficult it has</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.199" end="01:36:43.480" style="s2">we have it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.900" end="01:36:45.430" style="s2">being so successful I mean that this</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.480" end="01:36:49.239" style="s2">that you can smell that we&#39;re almost at</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.430" end="01:36:51.730" style="s2">the end of most of this chapter we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.239" end="01:36:53.739" style="s2">exhausted everything that we know that</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.730" end="01:36:56.050" style="s2">has worked previously which is like to</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.739" end="01:36:58.060" style="s2">vary the assumptions a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.050" end="01:37:00.190" style="s2">every and that&#39;s been spectacularly</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.060" end="01:37:01.420" style="s2">successful and now it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.190" end="01:37:03.850" style="s2">anymore and it hasn&#39;t worked for almost</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.420" end="01:37:05.170" style="s2">50 years right it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.850" end="01:37:06.790" style="s2">frustrating I think that&#39;s why most</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.170" end="01:37:09.100" style="s2">people are wise to stay the hell away</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.790" end="01:37:11.440" style="s2">from it and I think a lot of the smarter</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.100" end="01:37:14.710" style="s2">Minds are going into machine learning or</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.440" end="01:37:17.620" style="s2">even biophysics or just into other field</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.710" end="01:37:20.920" style="s2">or okay or even condensed matter how do</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.620" end="01:37:22.210" style="s2">you feel about that I feel like I&#39;m out</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.920" end="01:37:23.830" style="s2">in an island in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.210" end="01:37:26.890" style="s2">Pacific watching it from unfold from</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.830" end="01:37:29.440" style="s2">afar well I work on the puzzle myself my</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.890" end="01:37:31.600" style="s2">own different way you&#39;re having fun yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.440" end="01:37:34.410" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my prime directive is have</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.600" end="01:37:35.470" style="s2">fun is to have fun and do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.410" end="01:37:36.970" style="s2">inducing</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.470" end="01:37:39.220" style="s2">other people to do this as kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.970" end="01:37:41.280" style="s2">maybe the big programs fall apart and we</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.220" end="01:37:43.750" style="s2">start just becoming individuals trying</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.280" end="01:37:45.430" style="s2">crazy strategies that probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.750" end="01:37:46.840" style="s2">work yeah I mean there there are</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.430" end="01:37:48.490" style="s2">undergraduate textbooks and</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.840" end="01:37:51.160" style="s2">undergraduate courses on string theory</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.490" end="01:37:52.840" style="s2">yeah okay and people from undergraduates</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.160" end="01:37:55.930" style="s2">they&#39;re that and and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.840" end="01:37:58.660" style="s2">culture of arrogance saying string</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.930" end="01:38:00.730" style="s2">theory is the pinnacle of physics right</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.660" end="01:38:02.800" style="s2">and people are coming up to you that and</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.730" end="01:38:04.960" style="s2">they&#39;re becoming and if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.800" end="01:38:07.870" style="s2">working on fundamental physics and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.960" end="01:38:09.550" style="s2">the the whole area of string theory has</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.870" end="01:38:12.550" style="s2">gotten so large in the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.550" end="01:38:14.710" style="s2">research done sure that it just takes an</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.550" end="01:38:18.010" style="s2">enormous amount of intellectual effort</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.710" end="01:38:20.950" style="s2">to consume it and to get it up to speed</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.010" end="01:38:22.930" style="s2">on to what the current status is of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.950" end="01:38:25.390" style="s2">field and by the time you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.930" end="01:38:27.040" style="s2">you&#39;re so invested then of course what</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.390" end="01:38:29.110" style="s2">you want to do is go and continue a</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.040" end="01:38:30.850" style="s2">postdoc in string theory when you</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.110" end="01:38:32.650" style="s2">graduate and they&#39;re there hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.850" end="01:38:34.870" style="s2">students who are coming up this way and</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.650" end="01:38:36.760" style="s2">when they get there they go to help like</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.870" end="01:38:39.760" style="s2">I did this morning you look at it John</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.760" end="01:38:42.520" style="s2">the high-energy physics theory section</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.760" end="01:38:45.550" style="s2">where of this thing called the archive</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.520" end="01:38:48.280" style="s2">where all the new papers are found every</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.550" end="01:38:50.770" style="s2">day yeah and and and the this</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.280" end="01:38:54.070" style="s2">high-energy physics archive also has a</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.770" end="01:38:55.060" style="s2">postdoc and job posting board and just</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.070" end="01:38:56.170" style="s2">just for giggles</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.060" end="01:38:57.640" style="s2">I went say okay well how many</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.170" end="01:39:00.550" style="s2">opportunities does a rising string</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.640" end="01:39:02.110" style="s2">theorist have now and I went looked and</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.550" end="01:39:03.730" style="s2">there are all these subfields of physics</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.110" end="01:39:05.950" style="s2">the condensed matter is a big party</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.730" end="01:39:07.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s so incredibly vibrant and</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.950" end="01:39:09.430" style="s2">right and productive right now and you</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.930" end="01:39:12.220" style="s2">go into high energy theory and okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.430" end="01:39:15.610" style="s2">there are 30 positions open in North</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.220" end="01:39:17.800" style="s2">America okay all right and some of them</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.610" end="01:39:19.210" style="s2">are open to string theorists but I have</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.800" end="01:39:21.130" style="s2">those thirty positions you go how many</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.210" end="01:39:22.300" style="s2">of them actually actively want a string</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.130" end="01:39:26.140" style="s2">theorist and are looking for a strength</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.300" end="01:39:27.580" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s one one Eric so you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.140" end="01:39:29.380" style="s2">these hundreds of people groomed up</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.580" end="01:39:31.000" style="s2">saying string theory is the pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.380" end="01:39:32.530" style="s2">what you can be studying and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.000" end="01:39:34.450" style="s2">nowhere for them to go well but the</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.530" end="01:39:37.090" style="s2">field is dying well because it was a</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.450" end="01:39:39.070" style="s2">baby-boomer phenomenon we treated it as</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.090" end="01:39:42.010" style="s2">if it was an intellectual phenomena but</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.070" end="01:39:45.190" style="s2">it was actually this weird generational</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.010" end="01:39:48.070" style="s2">phenomena that this took hold you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.190" end="01:39:49.369" style="s2">this is very weird feature of 1951 where</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.070" end="01:39:52.099" style="s2">Frank will check</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.369" end="01:39:54.649" style="s2">ed Witten two great physicists born in</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.099" end="01:39:57.079" style="s2">the same year will check is effectively</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.649" end="01:39:59.269" style="s2">like the last guy to make the train for</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.079" end="01:40:01.820" style="s2">real physics he&#39;s an amazing guy</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.269" end="01:40:04.340" style="s2">yeah and then Witten born later that</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.820" end="01:40:06.079" style="s2">year probably more powerful than anyone</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.340" end="01:40:09.260" style="s2">else alive in terms of his mental</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.079" end="01:40:10.969" style="s2">abilities hasn&#39;t had a trip to Stockholm</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.260" end="01:40:13.399" style="s2">because he hasn&#39;t been able to make</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.969" end="01:40:16.340" style="s2">contact with the physical world and</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.399" end="01:40:18.530" style="s2">almost certainly in any era that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.340" end="01:40:19.789" style="s2">this one this guy would have been to</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.530" end="01:40:23.479" style="s2">Stockholm</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.789" end="01:40:25.159" style="s2">once or more yeah and it&#39;s in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.479" end="01:40:26.629" style="s2">it&#39;s a cultural problem we&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.159" end="01:40:27.919" style="s2">this culture of particle physics where</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.629" end="01:40:29.659" style="s2">we have everybody in the same community</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.919" end="01:40:32.209" style="s2">studying the same popular direction in</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.659" end="01:40:33.559" style="s2">full force as if there was lots of data</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.209" end="01:40:35.300" style="s2">coming in supporting that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.559" end="01:40:37.489" style="s2">not so what it is is they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.300" end="01:40:39.139" style="s2">full-bore full self-supporting force a</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.489" end="01:40:40.820" style="s2">long direction that in my mind just</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.139" end="01:40:43.749" style="s2">doesn&#39;t describe our universe and what</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.820" end="01:40:45.919" style="s2">we need is an exploratory phase with</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.749" end="01:40:47.449" style="s2">physicist students coming up and picking</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.919" end="01:40:49.459" style="s2">up stuff that they think is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.449" end="01:40:51.860" style="s2">and following that direction on their</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.459" end="01:40:54.979" style="s2">own branching away from the main herd</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.860" end="01:40:56.749" style="s2">and by having more explorers going</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.979" end="01:40:58.969" style="s2">different directions you&#39;re more likely</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.749" end="01:41:00.439" style="s2">to find something good and I guess my</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.969" end="01:41:02.239" style="s2">hope is that you know some graduate</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.439" end="01:41:04.429" style="s2">student will listen through this</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.239" end="01:41:06.469" style="s2">incredibly long and detailed podcast and</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.429" end="01:41:07.639" style="s2">go look at stuff and say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.469" end="01:41:09.530" style="s2">kind of interesting maybe I want to</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.639" end="01:41:11.539" style="s2">learn more about that do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.530" end="01:41:13.939" style="s2">ideas or the Pacific Science Institute</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.539" end="01:41:16.879" style="s2">is there any way that our listeners can</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.939" end="01:41:20.119" style="s2">support it yeah are you a are you a</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.879" end="01:41:21.979" style="s2">non-profit 501c3 nonprofit I&#39;m be very</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.119" end="01:41:24.559" style="s2">happy to take donations and put those</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.979" end="01:41:27.619" style="s2">donations to use supporting scientists</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.559" end="01:41:29.300" style="s2">to diverse lives okay and these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.619" end="01:41:32.749" style="s2">just it&#39;s not just supporting physicists</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.300" end="01:41:35.479" style="s2">the idea is that as you said science has</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.749" end="01:41:36.949" style="s2">supported our economy to incredible</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.479" end="01:41:38.389" style="s2">degree and I don&#39;t think scientists have</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.949" end="01:41:40.820" style="s2">been sufficiently personally rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.389" end="01:41:42.229" style="s2">for that so basically what I want to do</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.820" end="01:41:44.300" style="s2">is you know give them a nice place to</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.229" end="01:41:45.619" style="s2">hang out and Maui and enjoy the</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.300" end="01:41:47.929" style="s2">environment and work and think on</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.619" end="01:41:48.229" style="s2">whatever they want undirected while they</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.929" end="01:41:49.719" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.229" end="01:41:52.070" style="s2">it was a place to fight groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.719" end="01:41:53.539" style="s2">effectively with a little field while</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.070" end="01:41:55.639" style="s2">still having community support well</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.539" end="01:41:57.169" style="s2">solving community support the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.639" end="01:41:58.459" style="s2">I&#39;ve very limited resource right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.169" end="01:42:00.260" style="s2">basically running this out of my house</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.459" end="01:42:02.140" style="s2">right I have a big piece of land I have</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.260" end="01:42:03.670" style="s2">dreams for what I want build on you</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.140" end="01:42:05.650" style="s2">in there and it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.670" end="01:42:08.020" style="s2">generous that people can hang out and</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.650" end="01:42:10.000" style="s2">just actually fulfill the promise of</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.020" end="01:42:11.380" style="s2">dreaming about our world and trying</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.000" end="01:42:13.990" style="s2">things that they wouldn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.380" end="01:42:15.580" style="s2">comfortable trying under the watchful</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.990" end="01:42:16.690" style="s2">eyes of a departmental chairman is</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.580" end="01:42:20.350" style="s2">telling them what they need it&#39;s ready</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.690" end="01:42:23.200" style="s2">to get chair tenure or to win grants do</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.350" end="01:42:25.450" style="s2">you have any sense of what we should be</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.200" end="01:42:26.920" style="s2">directing people to do if they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.450" end="01:42:28.990" style="s2">position to change the culture of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.920" end="01:42:31.330" style="s2">field I always want to think like we</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.990" end="01:42:33.820" style="s2">still have a few old great people that</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.330" end="01:42:38.100" style="s2">everybody looks up to and they refuse to</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.820" end="01:42:41.800" style="s2">say something really provocative like</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.100" end="01:42:44.260" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing that I dream about we</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.800" end="01:42:47.680" style="s2">get all of the negative results they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.260" end="01:42:50.320" style="s2">incredibly demotivating allow your young</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.680" end="01:42:55.230" style="s2">people to violate several of them</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.320" end="01:42:57.700" style="s2">without being string theorists and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.230" end="01:43:00.130" style="s2">insist that they try to pay that back</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.700" end="01:43:01.600" style="s2">once they&#39;ve been exploring a theory</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.130" end="01:43:04.030" style="s2">that in a previous era would have been</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.600" end="01:43:06.070" style="s2">dead on arrival because somewhere we</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.030" end="01:43:09.370" style="s2">have to go backwards to go forwards we</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.070" end="01:43:11.770" style="s2">have to question something that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.370" end="01:43:13.840" style="s2">rock-solid in all of our minds but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.770" end="01:43:15.460" style="s2">actually right don&#39;t I mean yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.840" end="01:43:17.170" style="s2">totally right and this sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.460" end="01:43:19.750" style="s2">inertia that&#39;s holding things back is</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.170" end="01:43:21.400" style="s2">it&#39;s in biology it&#39;s in computer science</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.750" end="01:43:23.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in it&#39;s in all fields of science so</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.400" end="01:43:25.510" style="s2">I would say just I mean it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.800" end="01:43:27.010" style="s2">best thing to do just to find people who</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.510" end="01:43:28.210" style="s2">are really frickin smart and want to</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.010" end="01:43:29.740" style="s2">work on stuff on their own and give them</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.210" end="01:43:32.830" style="s2">money and support and limb to it unless</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.740" end="01:43:34.390" style="s2">well this is the and I I&#39;m on record as</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.830" end="01:43:36.910" style="s2">saying that we have too much oversight</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.390" end="01:43:39.160" style="s2">too much transparency and too much</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.910" end="01:43:41.560" style="s2">accountability it&#39;s strangling us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.160" end="01:43:43.780" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely true that&#39;s absolute you</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.560" end="01:43:45.100" style="s2">well Garret I really appreciate you</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.780" end="01:43:47.020" style="s2">sitting down it&#39;s a hell of an</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.100" end="01:43:49.810" style="s2">experiment to just even try to have</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.020" end="01:43:52.570" style="s2">conversations about you know what might</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.810" end="01:43:53.620" style="s2">be the path towards final theories of</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.570" end="01:43:55.210" style="s2">everything and I&#39;m actually really</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.620" end="01:43:57.640" style="s2">worried that we hurt most of your</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.210" end="01:43:59.350" style="s2">listeners well but I&#39;ll do that if we</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.640" end="01:44:00.580" style="s2">use this at all I&#39;ll try to say</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.350" end="01:44:03.160" style="s2">something at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.580" end="01:44:04.630" style="s2">program to try to say what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.160" end="01:44:06.130" style="s2">people are listening to so they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.630" end="01:44:08.860" style="s2">an idea they&#39;re not just gonna stumble</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.130" end="01:44:11.620" style="s2">in on a podcast and hear people talking</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.860" end="01:44:13.360" style="s2">about bosons fermions ea8 quantization</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.620" end="01:44:15.880" style="s2">and have no idea what&#39;s going on the</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.360" end="01:44:17.650" style="s2">fact is very few people are in</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.880" end="01:44:19.870" style="s2">vested in this like this but this is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.650" end="01:44:23.830" style="s2">fabric of reality ultimately in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.870" end="01:44:26.290" style="s2">question but how we go about trying to</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.830" end="01:44:28.410" style="s2">probe whatever&#39;s next yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.290" end="01:44:30.700" style="s2">amazing I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.410" end="01:44:34.570" style="s2">significant and intricate and difficult</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.700" end="01:44:36.730" style="s2">puzzle there is right now for anybody to</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.570" end="01:44:38.590" style="s2">tackle and to immerse themselves in and</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.730" end="01:44:40.510" style="s2">I also think it&#39;s potentially incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.590" end="01:44:42.100" style="s2">rewarding but it&#39;s also where the</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.510" end="01:44:43.420" style="s2">hardest things you can it&#39;s a yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.100" end="01:44:45.850" style="s2">probably the hardest thing has never</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.420" end="01:44:49.660" style="s2">been harder yeah that&#39;s almost as hard</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.850" end="01:44:51.580" style="s2">as learning to surf okay well through</p>
