<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">going to enter into one questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.289" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">through one particular part of the work</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">that I&#39;m interested in in sharing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">the integral people which is nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:14.519" style="s2">and complex medicine science I will</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:17.299" style="s2">rephrase that but then we&#39;ll be going</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.519" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">and navigating into different types of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.299" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">things that will open up but all</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.720" end="00:02:27.600" style="s2">directed into sensing what is that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">need to do in this moment where are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.600" end="00:02:33.329" style="s2">practical steps where are the actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:37.110" style="s2">activities what is happening the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.329" end="00:02:39.299" style="s2">that can inform us what what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.110" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">in this moment of transition what we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.299" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">do to develop higher ways and better</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:48.200" style="s2">senses who we are together as collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:51.540" style="s2">so hi Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.200" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">happy to be here thank you I&#39;m delighted</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.540" end="00:02:59.750" style="s2">to have you here today so as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">I want to have like one entry point</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.750" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">question for us to start with around</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:10.169" style="s2">nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:12.150" style="s2">and around the the work that you do and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.169" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">then your hacker collective but first</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.150" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">perhaps the first question is can</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:20.940" style="s2">you tell us what the tropics are so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:24.690" style="s2">people just like can&#39;t understand sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.940" end="00:03:28.739" style="s2">why it&#39;s important yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.690" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">tropics are chemicals that enhance some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.739" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">aspect of cognitive function the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.269" end="00:03:37.340" style="s2">formal best definition of nootropics is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">any chemical that can enhance some</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.340" end="00:03:43.080" style="s2">aspect of cognitive function like memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">or focus or herbal fluency or pattern</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.080" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">recognition beyond someone&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">baseline without meaningful negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">side effects and so this is in Contra</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">distinction to brain nutrients which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">all the vitamins minerals amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.180" style="s2">fatty acids that brain just naturally</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:01.319" style="s2">needs your nervous system or whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.180" end="00:04:02.910" style="s2">factory embodied cognition a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.319" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">physiology needs to be able to process</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.910" end="00:04:08.010" style="s2">information well those aren&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">really elevate capacity beyond baseline</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.010" end="00:04:10.709" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna bring you back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">baseline if there&#39;s deficiency because</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.709" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">those are really part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:16.949" style="s2">evolutionary environment right so brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:18.780" style="s2">nutrients are foundational things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.949" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">then what we think of as smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.780" end="00:04:23.850" style="s2">which are usually pharmaceuticals that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.850" end="00:04:25.800" style="s2">are for a DD or sometimes narcolepsy or</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.850" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">sometimes neurodegenerative diseases</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.800" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">that can enhance some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:34.650" style="s2">cognitive function but usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:36.539" style="s2">fairly narrow and usually it&#39;s with some</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.650" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">side effects so this is adderall</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.539" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">modafinil vyvanse ritalin you know those</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:44.490" style="s2">kinds of psychostimulants psych meds and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:45.750" style="s2">many other things so the tropics are</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.490" end="00:04:48.389" style="s2">this kind of interesting category that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.750" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">trying to see if we can elevate aspects</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.389" end="00:04:53.220" style="s2">of cognitive and then more widely also</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">psycho cognitive function from a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.220" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">physiological you know biochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">perspective and if we can do it without</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">negative side effects in even ideally</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.479" style="s2">with lasting benefits so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.950" style="s2">the field and why it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.479" end="00:05:10.650" style="s2">mm-hmm yes for me it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.950" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">interesting I started to do a research</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:15.570" style="s2">similar to that back in the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">before red wool or those were getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.570" end="00:05:19.560" style="s2">companies and I started to use like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">Warren and I started to use like ginkgo</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:24.180" style="s2">biloba and things like that and just</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:25.860" style="s2">like notice what happened to me what</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.180" end="00:05:27.510" style="s2">happened regards to my memory what</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.860" end="00:05:29.189" style="s2">happens to the rest of my close ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.510" end="00:05:31.319" style="s2">to focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.189" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">and that was really interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.319" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">know that you&#39;ve been developing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:36.569" style="s2">product when the product is out and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:40.469" style="s2">been testing that and I really really</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.569" end="00:05:43.409" style="s2">enjoy it I can tell you many different</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.469" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">experiences that I had who with with</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.409" end="00:05:47.189" style="s2">while yet but that&#39;s not the point for</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">the conversation but the preneur that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.189" end="00:05:53.729" style="s2">want to enter into is do these I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">understand that that by using nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.729" end="00:06:00.650" style="s2">we can enhance our cognitive function</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:06:04.169" style="s2">but have you used it or have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.650" end="00:06:06.840" style="s2">experienced what does it create when</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.169" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">when a certain group of people do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.840" end="00:06:13.710" style="s2">together the SID and hence the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:17.279" style="s2">collective capacity mm-hmm it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.710" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">interesting question so when we think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.279" end="00:06:20.370" style="s2">chemistry we think of affecting neuro</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:22.110" style="s2">chemistry in a way that&#39;s gonna affect</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.370" end="00:06:25.289" style="s2">people&#39;s psyches that are gonna affect</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.110" end="00:06:27.029" style="s2">them in our personally in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.289" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">positive experiences we usually think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.029" end="00:06:33.289" style="s2">in pathogens right so whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">talking about on the very violent side</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.289" end="00:06:38.159" style="s2">so many reasons that people come</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:39.960" style="s2">together and drink alcohol together or</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.159" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">use marijuana together is because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.960" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">get access some shared state of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">experience and maybe one that decreases</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:47.969" style="s2">inhibitions or decreases anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2">allows for some increased bandwidth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.969" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">connectivity and then deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:59.699" style="s2">is things like MDMA MDA other usually</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:02.550" style="s2">phenethylamine some tripped means some</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.699" end="00:07:06.360" style="s2">other categories of psychedelic but that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.550" end="00:07:09.839" style="s2">are specifically empathy increasing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.360" end="00:07:10.919" style="s2">are kind of relationship increasing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.839" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">terms of the neural chemistry they</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.919" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">affect which is almost exactly opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:20.699" style="s2">to it usually happens with the no tropic</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.699" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">not know tropics but smart drugs again</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.589" end="00:07:27.270" style="s2">most people are taking smart drugs for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">pretty individualistic purposes right</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.270" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">they&#39;re having a hard time focusing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:33.029" style="s2">they&#39;re not accomplishing as much as</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:35.339" style="s2">they want to they want to increase their</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.339" end="00:07:42.670" style="s2">on kind of single solo work and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.420" end="00:07:45.580" style="s2">how to roll works for that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.670" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">as a dopamine agonist will increase</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.580" end="00:07:50.520" style="s2">focus and will increase motivation no</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:54.040" style="s2">unfortunately as a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:55.420" style="s2">exhaustion Asst dopamine agonist it also</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.040" end="00:07:56.820" style="s2">means that if you use that for a while</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.420" end="00:07:59.500" style="s2">it&#39;s going to decrease your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.820" end="00:08:03.610" style="s2">endogenous dopamine regulatory process</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.500" end="00:08:05.830" style="s2">which means addiction and memories</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.610" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">really not primarily dopamine mediated</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.830" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">its acetylcholine and and you know many</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">other neurotransmitters blue tomates</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">involved in other catecholamines are</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:21.850" style="s2">involved so the brain is a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:25.780" style="s2">organ right and the brain nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.850" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">body mind environment complex as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.780" end="00:08:29.760" style="s2">complex of complex systems and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:32.260" style="s2">we&#39;re especially dealing with not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.760" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">human physiology but we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.260" end="00:08:36.520" style="s2">kind of the psychiatry or psycho neural</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:38.229" style="s2">interface where we&#39;re looking at the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.520" end="00:08:39.970" style="s2">that the upper right quadrant affects</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.229" end="00:08:42.070" style="s2">the other left right we could look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.970" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">the other side of the way mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.070" end="00:08:47.650" style="s2">and phenomenological in the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">affect you know the upper right but</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.650" end="00:08:50.230" style="s2">typically when we&#39;re thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">psychiatry direction we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.230" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">the effect of body on mind this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">really tricky thing to do from an</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">epistemology point of view because not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">only do we have to factor complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:02.350" style="s2">systems and many different complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:04.990" style="s2">systems got brain access and methylation</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.350" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">and genomics and head trauma and so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:09.640" style="s2">things but we also have to factor across</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:12.670" style="s2">the best technologic categories how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.640" end="00:09:14.410" style="s2">we assess causation of something arising</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.670" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">in consciousness from something arising</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:20.650" style="s2">in Physiology without reducing one</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">quadrant to the other so mmm causation</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.650" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t an adequate way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:27.520" style="s2">it but so there&#39;s a lot of reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.910" end="00:09:29.410" style="s2">the whole field of psychiatry and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.520" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">psychopharmacology are just profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.410" end="00:09:35.470" style="s2">in how to quit to the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:39.340" style="s2">actual needs of that space into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.470" end="00:09:41.350" style="s2">ontology of how the space works but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.340" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">know because we&#39;re typically with</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.350" end="00:09:45.250" style="s2">psychostimulants or that people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:46.900" style="s2">taking for notable effects they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.250" end="00:09:50.620" style="s2">be affecting a pretty narrow bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.900" end="00:09:54.339" style="s2">of things they&#39;re usually actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.620" end="00:09:56.620" style="s2">things that decrease empathy mmm if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.339" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">Drive dopamine and then that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.620" end="00:10:00.730" style="s2">turn into increased norepinephrine and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">epinephrine you can move into a more</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.730" end="00:10:05.319" style="s2">sympathetic less parasympathetic place</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.740" end="00:10:07.769" style="s2">and so one of the common experiences</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.319" end="00:10:09.399" style="s2">that people have when they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.769" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">psychostimulants for increased</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.399" end="00:10:13.449" style="s2">productivity is as they get more</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:15.879" style="s2">frustrated when someone interrupts them</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.449" end="00:10:18.329" style="s2">and they have to do task switching they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.879" end="00:10:20.439" style="s2">have less empathy and sometimes even</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.329" end="00:10:24.550" style="s2">depersonalization or derealization</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.439" end="00:10:27.910" style="s2">and so one of our main goals was can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.550" end="00:10:29.819" style="s2">increase can we support increasing focus</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.910" end="00:10:32.740" style="s2">and attention and concentration and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.819" end="00:10:35.639" style="s2">memory and pattern recognition and those</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.740" end="00:10:38.290" style="s2">kinds of cognitive traits without</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.639" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">negatively affecting their psychosocial</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.290" end="00:10:42.519" style="s2">and maybe even positively affecting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">so this was like one of our our big</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.519" end="00:10:47.350" style="s2">goals and if you think about it as how</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.720" style="s2">to affect both sides of the meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.350" end="00:10:52.089" style="s2">dialectics at once more ability to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.720" end="00:10:54.910" style="s2">intensely focus and better task</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.089" end="00:10:57.069" style="s2">switching those are very very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.910" end="00:10:58.629" style="s2">tracks and so then we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.069" end="00:11:00.279" style="s2">about a brain that&#39;s more optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.629" end="00:11:01.300" style="s2">one or the other or a psyche that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.279" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">optimized for one of the other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:06.370" style="s2">talking about a more adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:10.360" style="s2">they can actually respond adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:12.309" style="s2">environment needs yeah so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.360" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">really interesting deep dive for us to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.309" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">look at the chemistry and the neurology</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:19.389" style="s2">that was associated with very different</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:24.309" style="s2">types of cognitive and psychomotor</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.389" end="00:11:26.470" style="s2">states and see how can we seek to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.309" end="00:11:28.689" style="s2">benefit the adaptive capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.470" end="00:11:31.029" style="s2">whole system the endogenous regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.689" end="00:11:34.149" style="s2">capacity of the whole system and across</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.029" end="00:11:36.879" style="s2">those kind of dialectic differences and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.149" end="00:11:40.199" style="s2">has it been in your experience like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.879" end="00:11:43.509" style="s2">stories of of success what have you been</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.199" end="00:11:47.170" style="s2">observing in your big site you know in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.509" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2">your own experience of course well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.170" end="00:11:51.009" style="s2">mean so with with this product that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:53.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to bring to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.009" end="00:11:55.720" style="s2">now qualia we have a pretty meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.170" end="00:11:57.939" style="s2">amount of data that&#39;s come back to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.720" end="00:12:00.249" style="s2">mm-hm and one of the things that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.939" end="00:12:02.920" style="s2">of people have reported is increased</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.249" end="00:12:05.199" style="s2">empathy increased vicarious experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.920" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">increased social intelligence social</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.199" end="00:12:11.090" style="s2">awareness and a lot of decrease</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">of inner anxiety inner critic that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.090" end="00:12:16.220" style="s2">damages people&#39;s social capacity right</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:18.140" style="s2">that has them so caught in internal glue</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.220" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">that they actually have less capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.140" end="00:12:23.870" style="s2">actually pay attention to other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:26.990" style="s2">rather than project possible triggers on</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.870" end="00:12:28.550" style="s2">other people and so even though that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.990" end="00:12:29.900" style="s2">wasn&#39;t what it was designed for it was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.550" end="00:12:31.340" style="s2">design constraint we were hoping it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.900" end="00:12:33.890" style="s2">would move in the direction of it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.340" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">beautiful to see that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.890" end="00:12:39.560" style="s2">been the experience of many people</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:41.300" style="s2">especially factoring that usually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.560" end="00:12:45.140" style="s2">processes that drive cognitive chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.300" end="00:12:49.760" style="s2">did the opposite that&#39;s interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.140" end="00:12:51.320" style="s2">I use it once for for going into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.760" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2">keynote and that I did a presentation</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.320" end="00:12:56.810" style="s2">and I was so happy that they first I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:13:00.440" style="s2">so exhausted the day before and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.810" end="00:13:02.960" style="s2">that day if I was so on and then I felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.440" end="00:13:07.690" style="s2">so happy I was really literally feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.960" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">a beautiful connection with people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.690" end="00:13:12.910" style="s2">very aware I just said like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">very specific form of presence that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.910" end="00:13:18.650" style="s2">happens so I think that there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:21.320" style="s2">lot of research that can be done around</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.650" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">what happens when we intentionally go</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.320" end="00:13:29.060" style="s2">into the space as individuals to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">a specific way space while empowering</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.060" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">ourselves or enhancing ourselves through</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:38.420" style="s2">the use of a nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:40.340" style="s2">so that that would be interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.420" end="00:13:41.990" style="s2">speaking about pattern recognition but</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.340" end="00:13:45.530" style="s2">in a collective I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.990" end="00:13:46.610" style="s2">definitely see that pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.530" end="00:13:48.890" style="s2">there&#39;s something fun that you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.610" end="00:13:53.480" style="s2">which is you know when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.890" end="00:13:56.270" style="s2">pharmacology of it pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.480" end="00:13:59.330" style="s2">is significantly mediated by dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.270" end="00:14:00.680" style="s2">right so when we get excessive dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.330" end="00:14:02.330" style="s2">we get schizophrenia and see patterns</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.680" end="00:14:06.100" style="s2">that aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.330" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">and I mean that&#39;s oversimplifying but</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.100" end="00:14:10.550" style="s2">drug-induced methamphetamine induced</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.200" style="s2">schizophrenic breaks are exactly that</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.170" end="00:14:38.950" style="s2">interesting is that all the chemicals</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.320" end="00:14:57.550" style="s2">mean there aren&#39;t certain cases where</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.940" end="00:15:00.730" style="s2">one can you know have a certain set of</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.390" end="00:16:28.600" style="s2">moving on rapidly there&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.350" end="00:16:30.310" style="s2">fun chemical that is in Phase two</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.600" end="00:16:30.889" style="s2">clinical trials for major depressive</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.889" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">by a company called neural stem right</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.269" end="00:16:36.439" style="s2">now many people familiar with nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:39.619" style="s2">will have heard of its called NS I 189</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.439" end="00:16:41.259" style="s2">and it is basically a neurogenic this</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.619" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">company neural stem started out doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.259" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">als work and they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:46.579" style="s2">developing neural stem cells and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:49.699" style="s2">injecting them they were also going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.579" end="00:16:51.829" style="s2">do spinal cord injuries and they started</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.699" end="00:16:53.660" style="s2">looking for small molecules that could</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.829" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">actually increase the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.660" end="00:16:57.499" style="s2">the neural stem cells and they found</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:16:59.449" style="s2">about six that did and then si 189 was</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.499" end="00:17:01.129" style="s2">their best shot and so rather than have</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.449" end="00:17:03.319" style="s2">to actually put the stem cells end they</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.129" end="00:17:06.889" style="s2">can use the small molecule orally and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.319" end="00:17:08.389" style="s2">the body&#39;s own process of creating you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.889" end="00:17:10.579" style="s2">know of neurogenesis creating new neural</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.389" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">and hippocampus then they can move</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">system is just increased this is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.149" end="00:17:18.230" style="s2">super interesting there&#39;s a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.100" end="00:17:19.639" style="s2">that you can increase neurogenesis but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.230" end="00:17:22.519" style="s2">this is actually a drug that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.639" end="00:17:25.159" style="s2">far along and even though it was for ALS</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.519" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">to begin with and it was for then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.159" end="00:17:29.990" style="s2">know starting to look at actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:32.389" style="s2">repairing damaged nervous system either</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.990" end="00:17:34.309" style="s2">from neurodegenerative disease or injury</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.389" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s curing major depressive</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.309" end="00:17:37.730" style="s2">disorder their hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:39.500" style="s2">they&#39;re actually seeing increased</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.769" end="00:17:50.029" style="s2">actually seeing the depression as an</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.029" end="00:17:54.019" style="s2">emotional information within it coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.220" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">and that as they can actually process</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.019" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">the information better they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:17:59.929" style="s2">find solutions and conclusions and not</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:03.169" style="s2">be overwhelmed and you know left in</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.929" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">those those emotional places and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.169" end="00:18:06.769" style="s2">a number of other techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.820" end="00:18:08.570" style="s2">processes that work through neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.769" end="00:18:10.039" style="s2">that are finding this so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.570" end="00:18:12.830" style="s2">interesting of like increased</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.039" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">information processing capacity not</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.830" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">being just a cognitive thing but being</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.600" end="00:18:18.019" style="s2">very related to emotion which then of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:21.769" style="s2">course relates to someone&#39;s capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.019" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">we space right it&#39;s like that then it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.769" end="00:18:27.320" style="s2">seems that it&#39;s a capacity to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">right because what is how do we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.320" end="00:18:33.080" style="s2">that emotional information so I said</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">like 10 I tend to think is the heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.080" end="00:18:38.990" style="s2">right there is like we have like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:41.029" style="s2">capacity to sense and to sense someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.990" end="00:18:43.010" style="s2">else when we&#39;re there in presence with</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.029" end="00:18:44.780" style="s2">them what is happening in their space or</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.010" end="00:18:47.390" style="s2">intuition or instead</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.780" end="00:18:49.490" style="s2">but then we get the insights from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.390" end="00:18:52.250" style="s2">verbal communication of whatever they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.490" end="00:18:56.930" style="s2">telling us and you can see when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.250" end="00:19:00.380" style="s2">is tight or is open or and then that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.930" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">also creates a certain space of trust a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.380" end="00:19:10.330" style="s2">satanist space of feeling together in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.720" end="00:19:10.330" style="s2">resonance I would say with one another</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.750" end="00:19:17.990" style="s2">you said perception I&#39;d say a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:20.810" style="s2">we think about often is sensory input</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.990" end="00:19:22.910" style="s2">perception improving processing of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.810" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">sensory input to make meaning out of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:28.670" style="s2">and informed choices and then choice</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:30.500" style="s2">actuator output and then being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.670" end="00:19:32.600" style="s2">perceive again the effect of our actions</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.500" end="00:19:36.470" style="s2">and we have a closed loop that really</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.600" end="00:19:38.390" style="s2">defines what is adaptive in any complex</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.470" end="00:19:41.990" style="s2">adaptive system and in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.390" end="00:19:43.640" style="s2">animal any biologic system sentry input</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.990" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">is worthless by itself if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.640" end="00:19:47.480" style="s2">actually make sense of it and act on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:49.070" style="s2">right action capacity would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.480" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">meaningless if it couldn&#39;t be informed</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.070" end="00:19:52.940" style="s2">by the right information necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:54.980" style="s2">make it the right action so evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:59.140" style="s2">actually selecting for this closed loop</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.980" end="00:20:01.370" style="s2">information cycle of information input</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.140" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">information processing sense making</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.370" end="00:20:05.260" style="s2">meaning making actuator output and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:08.330" style="s2">learning and that&#39;s what allows</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.260" end="00:20:10.130" style="s2">development and so then we think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.330" end="00:20:11.720" style="s2">that from a neurologic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.130" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">what is the what are the what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">those stages and how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.110" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">increase the effectiveness of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">learning loop that information</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:25.660" style="s2">processing them so you would name what</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:29.060" style="s2">are the levels of development that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.660" end="00:20:30.740" style="s2">nootropics would work on what would with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.060" end="00:20:33.110" style="s2">those I mean it&#39;s obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.740" end="00:20:36.460" style="s2">cognitive one but would they be also</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.110" end="00:20:40.070" style="s2">like in the emotional one or would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.460" end="00:20:43.910" style="s2">because I have heard many learning right</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.070" end="00:20:46.010" style="s2">learning and skill but I also seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.910" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">videos of people that are doing artistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.010" end="00:20:50.600" style="s2">are not doing arts and are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:53.990" style="s2">introducing it for more flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.600" end="00:20:56.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s right-brain left-brain so could</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.990" end="00:20:58.890" style="s2">you talk a little bit more about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.130" end="00:21:02.250" style="s2">I think the word no tropics is maybe too</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.890" end="00:21:05.190" style="s2">narrow here right because that that word</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">is usually used to denote cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.190" end="00:21:08.730" style="s2">function specifically but as we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:12.180" style="s2">talking about cognitive and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.730" end="00:21:14.610" style="s2">are not that separate and and athletic</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.180" end="00:21:16.980" style="s2">capacities that relate to sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.610" end="00:21:19.410" style="s2">motor capacity faster the acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.980" end="00:21:21.180" style="s2">that increases motor capacity is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.410" end="00:21:24.810" style="s2">same acetylcholine that&#39;s focused on</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.180" end="00:21:26.190" style="s2">memory consolidation and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.810" end="00:21:28.230" style="s2">that those different lines of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.190" end="00:21:30.090" style="s2">developments are totally different</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.230" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">independent separately developable</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:34.020" style="s2">pathways inside our physiology is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:37.220" style="s2">not how it works right it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.020" end="00:21:39.060" style="s2">integrated system than that and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.220" end="00:21:40.500" style="s2">affecting any of those things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.060" end="00:21:42.750" style="s2">gonna have some effect on all of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.500" end="00:21:45.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we really think about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.750" end="00:21:47.100" style="s2">do we increase it but in one way you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.480" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">call them all information processing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.100" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">different types of information being</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:52.890" style="s2">processed in different ways right and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">how do we increase the effective</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.890" end="00:21:57.090" style="s2">information processing capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:22:00.870" style="s2">entire system across all the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.090" end="00:22:03.660" style="s2">development thank you that made me think</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.870" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">about information processing in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.660" end="00:22:09.690" style="s2">collective level and I know that part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:14.070" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing this work is larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.690" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">than just medicine isn&#39;t why I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.070" end="00:22:18.600" style="s2">want to attract what was your intent</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:21.060" style="s2">what is your true intent what lies</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.600" end="00:22:23.940" style="s2">behind this innovation what do you truly</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.060" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">want to create in the world by launching</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.940" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">this initiative this product the reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">I mean this product is one of lots of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:36.420" style="s2">products that we&#39;ve got in development</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:39.450" style="s2">both for medical applications and</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.450" end="00:22:43.140" style="s2">all of that just scratching the surface</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.680" end="00:22:46.770" style="s2">of what kind of the future of human</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.140" end="00:22:48.930" style="s2">wellbeing optimization looks like but</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.770" end="00:22:53.490" style="s2">why that whole field is interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.930" end="00:23:01.020" style="s2">mean one unnecessary suffering sucks</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.490" end="00:23:05.040" style="s2">right and our system of medicine in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.020" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">system of well-being science is good at</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.040" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">a few things and we&#39;ve kind of tapped</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">those things out it&#39;s really good when</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.330" style="s2">the causation is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.570" style="s2">really obvious and that usually means</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.330" end="00:23:17.279" style="s2">acute causation and if the causation is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.570" end="00:23:20.850" style="s2">not really obvious because it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.279" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">delayed in time or it&#39;s multifactorial</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.850" end="00:23:27.390" style="s2">or it has a complex causal cascade then</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:29.640" style="s2">we call it not immune disease and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:30.929" style="s2">neurodegenerative disease aging cancer</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.640" end="00:23:32.519" style="s2">and just really there already a path</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.929" end="00:23:35.010" style="s2">that we don&#39;t really know so we just do</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.519" end="00:23:39.559" style="s2">symptomatic treatment the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.010" end="00:23:39.559" style="s2">fiscal structure of medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.620" end="00:23:44.909" style="s2">misaligned between good medicine because</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.389" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">if we&#39;re as a business if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.909" end="00:23:49.130" style="s2">optimize the lifetime value of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:52.470" style="s2">customer and a customer is a patient</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.130" end="00:23:54.389" style="s2">then we&#39;re not really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.470" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">preventing illness and we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.389" end="00:23:57.690" style="s2">looking at curing it quickly because if</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:23:59.399" style="s2">I got to do a billion dollars to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.690" end="00:24:00.990" style="s2">through phase three clinical trials and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.399" end="00:24:02.460" style="s2">then we cure someone very quickly how</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.990" end="00:24:04.679" style="s2">can we ever make the money back right</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.460" end="00:24:06.350" style="s2">we&#39;re not interested eases that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.679" end="00:24:09.149" style="s2">affect that many people in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.350" end="00:24:10.679" style="s2">symptom treatment is great right symptom</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.149" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">treatment that causes side effects that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.679" end="00:24:14.279" style="s2">you need another drug that&#39;s a cross</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:15.269" style="s2">seller and upsell like from a business</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.279" end="00:24:17.100" style="s2">point of view that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.269" end="00:24:19.139" style="s2">so the financial structure is basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.100" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">broken the IP structure where we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.139" end="00:24:22.620" style="s2">only look at synthetic molecules that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:23.820" style="s2">are patentable and then only during</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.620" end="00:24:25.230" style="s2">their patent life and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.820" end="00:24:26.399" style="s2">pretend like we&#39;re innovating new better</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.230" end="00:24:28.260" style="s2">stuff just because they ran out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.399" end="00:24:31.799" style="s2">patent life like the IP structures</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.260" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">broken and the epistemology which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.799" end="00:24:36.269" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to do complicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:38.309" style="s2">system science on complex systems right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.269" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to pretend that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.309" end="00:24:43.490" style="s2">adjust one or two variables in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:46.549" style="s2">radically complex system and understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.490" end="00:24:49.169" style="s2">what it&#39;s gonna do like causation</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.549" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense that way in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.169" end="00:24:51.720" style="s2">system we have to think of it more</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.190" end="00:24:54.750" style="s2">dispositional II and was much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.720" end="00:24:56.700" style="s2">complex dynamics of in our causation so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.750" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in just a completely</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.700" end="00:25:00.389" style="s2">new version of medicine and not even I</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">mean obsoleting medicine of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.389" end="00:25:03.809" style="s2">science and optimization at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:06.779" style="s2">physiology level but then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.809" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s just the upper right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.779" end="00:25:10.380" style="s2">obviously affected by the environments</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:12.090" style="s2">that people are in and lower right by</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.380" end="00:25:16.230" style="s2">their psyche in the upper left right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.090" end="00:25:17.639" style="s2">then this now we get into how does the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.230" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">individual affect the collective and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.639" end="00:25:20.340" style="s2">are they affected by the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.080" end="00:25:22.679" style="s2">how do we work on those things together</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.340" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">so if we make better if we make an</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.679" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">environment that is less</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:27.779" style="s2">toxicity in it then we&#39;re not dealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:32.789" style="s2">with diseases that are toxic illogic in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.779" end="00:25:35.340" style="s2">origin right the individual the better</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.789" end="00:25:39.779" style="s2">systems of agriculture better systems of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.340" end="00:25:41.629" style="s2">education media but the better economic</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.629" end="00:25:46.500" style="s2">economic systems governance system sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.100" end="00:25:49.139" style="s2">making systems now how can we affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.500" end="00:25:50.129" style="s2">individuals today so that they influence</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.139" end="00:25:53.250" style="s2">the collective in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.129" end="00:25:56.039" style="s2">both directions are true right the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.250" end="00:25:57.509" style="s2">Republican Democrat historic debates the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.039" end="00:25:59.009" style="s2">libertarian Marxist debates have been</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.009" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">more important and they are reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:10.019" style="s2">and so why we were real interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:11.850" style="s2">the kind of individual optimization side</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.019" end="00:26:14.730" style="s2">is obviously human quality of life is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.850" end="00:26:16.110" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful period and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.730" end="00:26:18.990" style="s2">just intrinsically meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:23.990" style="s2">actually meaning reifies in subjective</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.990" end="00:26:26.100" style="s2">experience and the next step is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.990" end="00:26:27.990" style="s2">we&#39;re not just interested in humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.100" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">having increased quality of life but</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.990" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">also increase capacity to act</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">meaningfully in ways that affect the</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:40.379" style="s2">not just human but all all things and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.379" end="00:26:42.809" style="s2">it happens to be that what really</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.379" end="00:26:44.399" style="s2">increases human capacity and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.809" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">increases their quality of life is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.399" end="00:26:53.129" style="s2">same thing this is again optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">across a dialectic and so when we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.129" end="00:26:59.570" style="s2">looking at existential crisis right</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.370" style="s2">existential threats who are looking at</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.850" end="00:27:13.470" style="s2">by human action then the question</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.669" end="00:27:15.029" style="s2">becomes well what are what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.470" end="00:27:16.669" style="s2">influences of human action and how can</p>

<p begin="00:29:39.460" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">radically increase their quality of life</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.030" end="00:30:44.520" style="s2">availabilities and etc so I would I</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.790" end="00:30:47.910" style="s2">would generally talk about that and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.520" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">more personalized and hopefully relevant</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.910" end="00:30:57.780" style="s2">way most of the times we think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">actions we can all do in our own life to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.780" end="00:31:03.630" style="s2">make things better at a global level we</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:05.669" style="s2">think about pretty trivial and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.630" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">mean to say these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.669" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">important but trivial relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">scope and urgency of the issues and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:19.740" style="s2">complexity we think about basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:21.540" style="s2">consuming less stuff and consuming</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:25.260" style="s2">better stuff or less stuff right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.540" end="00:31:27.980" style="s2">which our focus is being less bad where</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.260" end="00:31:30.120" style="s2">we are net negative we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.980" end="00:31:32.130" style="s2">liabilities on nature&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.120" end="00:31:34.460" style="s2">right rather than assets on nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.130" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">balance sheet if you want to look at the</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:39.540" style="s2">and complexity of the biosphere as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.130" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">whole and we&#39;re looking at can we slow</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.540" end="00:31:43.530" style="s2">how bad we are like it&#39;s just a totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:46.200" style="s2">wrong way of thinking about it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.530" end="00:31:47.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a fine starting point to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.200" end="00:31:50.370" style="s2">about but really we actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.970" end="00:31:52.140" style="s2">build a new human civilization that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.370" end="00:31:54.450" style="s2">fundamentally on the asset side of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.140" end="00:31:56.190" style="s2">nature&#39;s balance sheet that is net</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.450" end="00:31:58.919" style="s2">positive to everything that&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.190" end="00:32:00.419" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t look like a retrofit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.919" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">this civilization at all it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.419" end="00:32:06.280" style="s2">fundamental ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2">redesign work I mean there now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.280" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">know how deep will go and how familiar</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">people are but there-there is no system</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.590" end="00:32:17.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no version of capitalism it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:19.000" style="s2">adequate as a system of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.230" end="00:32:21.070" style="s2">in the presence of exponential</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.799" end="00:32:29.320" style="s2">biosphere at this point and etc that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lead to catastrophic tipping</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.320" end="00:32:34.980" style="s2">bones there&#39;s no version of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.419" style="s2">representative democracy within</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.980" end="00:32:39.490" style="s2">nationalist governments that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.419" end="00:32:42.520" style="s2">lead to catastrophic problems so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.490" end="00:32:46.659" style="s2">kind of shift that we need is axiom</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.520" end="00:32:48.039" style="s2">level and I&#39;m not gonna propose Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.659" end="00:32:49.480" style="s2">or socialism or any other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.039" end="00:32:52.360" style="s2">hasn&#39;t worked I&#39;m gonna propose things</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.480" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">that are reverse engineered from design</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.360" end="00:32:56.770" style="s2">constraints of what&#39;s actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:58.120" style="s2">and sufficient that are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.770" end="00:32:59.470" style="s2">different than any kinds of systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.120" end="00:33:02.500" style="s2">proposed so far but have learned from</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.470" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">them and learn a lot from how nature and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.500" end="00:33:11.230" style="s2">complement systems work so yeah if I if</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">I was to be saying in general what can</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.230" end="00:33:14.679" style="s2">people do to be helpful to that I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">say be aware that civilization as we</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.679" end="00:33:25.299" style="s2">know it is self terminating stop trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:29.289" style="s2">to win at a self terminating game I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.299" end="00:33:31.210" style="s2">what start really earnestly exploring</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.289" end="00:33:32.740" style="s2">what alternatives that might be viable</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.210" end="00:33:36.400" style="s2">look like and how you can contribute</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.740" end="00:33:39.130" style="s2">your life energy to them mm-hmm so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.400" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">let me do that they have to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.130" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">you in in refers to how we&#39;re facing in</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:48.309" style="s2">these collapse in all levels and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:51.880" style="s2">complexity is way too fast for anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.309" end="00:33:55.419" style="s2">really know exactly how so the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.880" end="00:33:57.730" style="s2">number of paths possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.419" end="00:34:01.750" style="s2">overwhelming it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.730" end="00:34:04.450" style="s2">overwhelming so yeah why have you found</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.750" end="00:34:04.900" style="s2">in your research that gives a hope for</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.450" end="00:34:06.400" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.900" end="00:34:08.500" style="s2">what is that you found in your research</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.400" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">that it would say have you find these</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.500" end="00:34:15.840" style="s2">places where you say we would find these</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:18.270" style="s2">then we could reverse into an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.840" end="00:34:24.570" style="s2">game we can actually do this can we</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.270" end="00:34:26.940" style="s2">actually do this yeah you know speaking</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.570" end="00:34:29.100" style="s2">to an abroad Ian&#39;s there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.940" end="00:34:32.310" style="s2">are very helpful in each quadrant and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.100" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">then across all the quadrants that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.310" end="00:34:43.320" style="s2">already plausible and lower-right we</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">need to stop building complicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.320" end="00:34:52.139" style="s2">technology complicated built worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.740" end="00:34:54.419" style="s2">start actually building emergent complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.139" end="00:34:56.190" style="s2">worlds that are extensions of the design</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.419" end="00:34:58.130" style="s2">principles and complexity of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.190" end="00:35:00.840" style="s2">world and that are commensurate with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.130" end="00:35:02.430" style="s2">and this means that you stop building</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.840" end="00:35:05.750" style="s2">individual pieces of tech and you build</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.430" end="00:35:08.850" style="s2">whole tech ecosystems right that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.750" end="00:35:11.700" style="s2">regenerative closed-loop post growth</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.850" end="00:35:14.280" style="s2">upcycling techy ecosystems and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.700" end="00:35:15.720" style="s2">means entire materials economies where</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.280" end="00:35:19.020" style="s2">you have a closed loop on the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.720" end="00:35:23.010" style="s2">right the atoms are actually you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.020" end="00:35:25.080" style="s2">needing new atom acquisition from mining</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.010" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">or virgin resource acquisition and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.080" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">you&#39;re not turning any of the atoms into</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:30.900" style="s2">waste your fundamental circular economy</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:33.510" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.900" end="00:35:35.580" style="s2">circular closed-loop economy and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.510" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">where the same stuff gets to keep being</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.580" end="00:35:42.090" style="s2">better in better forms within a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:44.340" style="s2">number of atoms a post growth system so</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.090" end="00:35:45.570" style="s2">basically steady-state system with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.340" end="00:35:48.060" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at steady-state</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.570" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">populations that are aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.060" end="00:35:52.020" style="s2">carrying capacity of the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:54.690" style="s2">they&#39;re up cycling because pattern</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.020" end="00:35:57.060" style="s2">information continues to evolve and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.690" end="00:36:00.570" style="s2">continue to impound new photons so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.060" end="00:36:03.720" style="s2">have to think of atoms photons energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.570" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">and pattern as three totally different</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.720" end="00:36:07.560" style="s2">non fungible things in the future of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:09.330" style="s2">economics we&#39;re gonna be dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.560" end="00:36:11.430" style="s2">finite number of atoms we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.330" end="00:36:14.010" style="s2">dealing with a much larger and less</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.430" end="00:36:19.050" style="s2">bounded amount of energy and an almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.010" end="00:36:21.540" style="s2">unbounded amount of information and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.050" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">those are those are non fungible with</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.540" end="00:36:24.300" style="s2">each other so you can&#39;t relate them all</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">to a currency and trade them it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.300" end="00:36:29.349" style="s2">make any sense because</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:30.999" style="s2">actually tradable so so building the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.349" end="00:36:33.609" style="s2">right kinds of infrastructure that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.999" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">actually resilient complex closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.609" end="00:36:38.849" style="s2">up cycling infrastructure that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">hopeful and exciting thing is possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.849" end="00:36:44.589" style="s2">right in the lower left we can think</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:47.230" style="s2">about building new systems of sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.589" end="00:36:52.029" style="s2">making intelligence right new systems of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">governance choice making new systems of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.029" end="00:36:57.789" style="s2">meaning making collective meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:59.650" style="s2">you know culture I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.789" end="00:37:04.619" style="s2">economics actually new systems of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.650" end="00:37:06.579" style="s2">basically resource allocation and human</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.619" end="00:37:08.019" style="s2">influencing patterns of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.579" end="00:37:11.589" style="s2">which are the two things that economics</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.019" end="00:37:14.019" style="s2">really deeply does as we are moving to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.589" end="00:37:15.059" style="s2">world where most of the shitty jobs can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.019" end="00:37:17.710" style="s2">be automated</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.059" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">one of the major axioms of why</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.710" end="00:37:22.599" style="s2">capitalism mattered was how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:25.989" style="s2">people to be the shitty jobs they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.599" end="00:37:27.489" style="s2">like it&#39;s fun to lay roads for a day for</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.989" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">a couple days and learn how to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.489" end="00:37:31.029" style="s2">nobody wants to spend their whole you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:32.799" style="s2">know multiple decades doing that 40 plus</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.029" end="00:37:36.759" style="s2">hours a week but society needs it done</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.799" end="00:37:38.739" style="s2">and so if the jobs need the people to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.759" end="00:37:41.259" style="s2">get done then we got to make it to where</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.739" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">the people need the jobs otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.259" end="00:37:44.170" style="s2">know if you do a Marxist thing we spread</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:45.759" style="s2">the resources between everybody then</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.170" end="00:37:47.109" style="s2">nobody wants to do the shitty jobs in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.759" end="00:37:48.999" style="s2">the state has to force when we call it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.109" end="00:37:51.339" style="s2">imperialism and so we don&#39;t like Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.999" end="00:37:52.539" style="s2">so we like it when the market which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.339" end="00:37:57.369" style="s2">if you don&#39;t do the shitty jobs you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.539" end="00:37:59.259" style="s2">starve right but that&#39;s free and then we</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.369" end="00:37:59.769" style="s2">say but you can educate yourself and get</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.259" end="00:38:01.480" style="s2">a better job</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.769" end="00:38:03.400" style="s2">but that statistically I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.480" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">theoretically possible but statistically</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.400" end="00:38:07.749" style="s2">very hard when those who are born into</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.279" style="s2">more have more resources to create more</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.749" end="00:38:10.809" style="s2">resources with those were born into less</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.279" end="00:38:16.420" style="s2">have less she get these ever widening</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.809" end="00:38:18.970" style="s2">gaps etc so but when you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.420" end="00:38:20.799" style="s2">automate and you know we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.970" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">automation of most of the jobs over the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.799" end="00:38:25.960" style="s2">next not not too many years I&#39;m not only</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:28.569" style="s2">you know all kinds of jobs not only the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.960" end="00:38:31.180" style="s2">automated very shitty jobs for also</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.569" end="00:38:32.769" style="s2">high-level right like diagnosis medical</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.180" end="00:38:33.720" style="s2">anything that you can write a procedure</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.769" end="00:38:37.109" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.720" end="00:38:38.460" style="s2">you can if you can write a procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.109" end="00:38:40.950" style="s2">it you can make a machine to it better</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.460" end="00:38:43.050" style="s2">than us if you can write a procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.950" end="00:38:44.550" style="s2">it it&#39;s not that fun for creative beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.050" end="00:38:47.099" style="s2">to spend must at much of their life</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.550" end="00:38:48.840" style="s2">doing yeah and so you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.099" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">extrinsic lee and sent them to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.840" end="00:38:52.140" style="s2">because infants are consented wants to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:56.250" style="s2">do things that are either connection or</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.140" end="00:38:59.070" style="s2">creativity based yes and so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.250" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">is either we try and stick with</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.070" end="00:39:02.730" style="s2">capitalism and have the most grotesque</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:06.090" style="s2">inequality come with technological</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.730" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">unemployment or we say we&#39;ll wait the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.090" end="00:39:09.480" style="s2">whole reason major part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.770" end="00:39:11.010" style="s2">reason fit of capitalism I&#39;m using one</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.480" end="00:39:12.920" style="s2">axiom there&#39;s obviously twenty others</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.010" end="00:39:16.200" style="s2">but we can go through all of them is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.920" end="00:39:17.609" style="s2">well now that we the people that jobs</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.200" end="00:39:19.530" style="s2">don&#39;t need the people anymore we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.609" end="00:39:20.910" style="s2">also create a Commonwealth economics</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.530" end="00:39:22.950" style="s2">where the people don&#39;t need the jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.910" end="00:39:26.220" style="s2">we move from an economics of extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.950" end="00:39:27.510" style="s2">motive to a system of intrinsic motives</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.220" end="00:39:29.550" style="s2">or than education is really about</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.510" end="00:39:32.310" style="s2">facilitating the unique intrinsic mode</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.550" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">of genius of everyone so we actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.310" end="00:39:38.910" style="s2">have the ability to build a new macro</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.420" end="00:40:02.970" style="s2">and best practices of the past get</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.950" end="00:40:05.190" style="s2">obsolete faster right our externalities</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.970" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">have already brought the biodiversity of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.190" end="00:40:08.550" style="s2">the planet radically down a very short</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:52.210" style="s2">that I would like to see that part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:55.329" style="s2">the research or part of that reflects an</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.210" end="00:44:01.410" style="s2">outcome that is more mainstream that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.329" end="00:44:04.809" style="s2">tells people how to connect when when</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.809" end="00:44:08.710" style="s2">in the levels of IDs or in the level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.940" end="00:44:12.670" style="s2">values but you&#39;re in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.710" end="00:44:16.180" style="s2">other parts of yourself that&#39;s why I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.670" end="00:44:19.480" style="s2">interested in seeing what are the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.180" end="00:44:21.640" style="s2">ways in which we can create higher</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.480" end="00:44:22.780" style="s2">states of consciousness or does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.640" end="00:44:34.390" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.780" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">great ok so we can see the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.390" end="00:44:41.950" style="s2">phase of increasing radicalization</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:44.049" style="s2">currently in many parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.950" end="00:44:51.069" style="s2">many parts of the industrialized world</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.049" end="00:44:52.809" style="s2">and the the political philosophy around</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.069" end="00:44:55.299" style="s2">this has been kind of the Machiavellian</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.809" end="00:44:56.770" style="s2">enemy hypothesis which is the only way</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.299" end="00:44:58.420" style="s2">to get people of very different</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.770" end="00:44:59.859" style="s2">dispositions together as if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.420" end="00:45:02.440" style="s2">larger enemy where they have to band</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.859" end="00:45:03.910" style="s2">together otherwise they&#39;ll keep going</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.440" end="00:45:08.799" style="s2">tribal til they get down to the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.910" end="00:45:14.520" style="s2">number and that has been mostly true</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.799" end="00:45:14.520" style="s2">right and so when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.620" end="00:45:21.430" style="s2">kind of very bizarre version of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.430" end="00:45:23.950" style="s2">post-modernism control left that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.430" end="00:45:25.330" style="s2">really driving the cohesion of a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:27.730" style="s2">of different groups into what&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.330" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">called the alt-right and the white</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.730" end="00:45:31.840" style="s2">nationalist and etc movements with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:35.950" style="s2">and you look at how far apart those are</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.840" end="00:45:39.820" style="s2">from each other the do you bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.950" end="00:45:41.710" style="s2">that together right and how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.820" end="00:45:43.420" style="s2">does that not become civil war and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.710" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">does civil war in the United States not</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.420" end="00:45:49.630" style="s2">become world war well if the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:51.250" style="s2">bring it together is to have an external</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.630" end="00:45:53.590" style="s2">enemy we&#39;ve been in Moore for decades</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.250" end="00:45:55.750" style="s2">now right if is to have an external</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.590" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">enemy big enough that the right and left</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.750" end="00:46:00.840" style="s2">our friends in relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:03.220" style="s2">external enemy that&#39;s also world war yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.840" end="00:46:04.150" style="s2">all right so these strategies just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.220" end="00:46:07.870" style="s2">look good at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.150" end="00:46:12.070" style="s2">and so one of the things is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.870" end="00:46:14.590" style="s2">first even people who understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.070" end="00:46:17.080" style="s2">military strategy military history I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.590" end="00:46:19.000" style="s2">think underestimates both anthro</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.080" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">complexity the complexity and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.000" end="00:46:24.040" style="s2">unpredictability of seven billion people</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:26.380" style="s2">and how many non-state actors have so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.040" end="00:46:29.140" style="s2">much power and etc and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.380" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">underestimate what exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.140" end="00:46:33.460" style="s2">really means in terms of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.270" end="00:46:38.920" style="s2">anything applicable in the past is it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.460" end="00:46:41.620" style="s2">cool now so to kind of get into that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.920" end="00:46:43.000" style="s2">know we saw a couple weeks ago now I</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.620" end="00:46:47.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know when this airs maybe it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.000" end="00:46:48.910" style="s2">months ago a drone drop a thermite bomb</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.080" end="00:46:55.060" style="s2">in the in the Ukraine on a munitions</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.910" end="00:46:57.850" style="s2">factory and it created a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.060" end="00:47:01.990" style="s2">multibillion-dollar level of damage from</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.850" end="00:47:05.470" style="s2">one little drone you know a near nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.990" end="00:47:08.470" style="s2">level of damage and we don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.470" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">did it but it&#39;s easy to do and that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.470" end="00:47:12.550" style="s2">not even a swarm of drones and building</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:14.170" style="s2">a swarm of drones with AI swarming</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.550" end="00:47:16.990" style="s2">algorithms from github that you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.170" end="00:47:19.750" style="s2">build in your own garage and web like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.990" end="00:47:21.670" style="s2">have exponential tech capability where</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.750" end="00:47:22.990" style="s2">non-state actors were little bitty</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.670" end="00:47:25.900" style="s2">actors that we can&#39;t even know if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.570" end="00:47:39.650" style="s2">Christmas cards just became $1,000 a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.090" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">year ago think about what that means</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.650" end="00:47:47.550" style="s2">think about what the increasing AI and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:50.730" style="s2">nanotech capacities mean right and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.550" end="00:47:52.020" style="s2">the first existential technology we had</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.730" end="00:47:54.540" style="s2">detect where we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.020" end="00:47:58.710" style="s2">everything that was the bomb but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.540" end="00:48:00.510" style="s2">bomb was such a expensive difficult</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.710" end="00:48:01.980" style="s2">thing to build the US was the only one</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.510" end="00:48:03.720" style="s2">who had it and then US and Russia two</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.980" end="00:48:05.310" style="s2">superpowers they could be locked in meet</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.720" end="00:48:06.540" style="s2">you sure destruction with their Intel</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.540" end="00:48:13.610" style="s2">could use it we lived in the Cold War as</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">a method of safety yeah but as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.610" end="00:48:22.110" style="s2">we have so many nuclear powers and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:23.430" style="s2">have powers that are as significant as</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.110" end="00:48:25.560" style="s2">nuclear that you don&#39;t even know where</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.430" end="00:48:30.030" style="s2">they are they&#39;re radically multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.560" end="00:48:34.140" style="s2">right how the did how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.030" end="00:48:36.030" style="s2">through that so one you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.140" end="00:48:38.810" style="s2">define what we&#39;re interested in working</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.030" end="00:48:43.380" style="s2">on one of the things we define is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.810" end="00:48:46.890" style="s2">civilization that is resilient and anti</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.380" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">fragile in the presence of X radically</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.890" end="00:48:52.710" style="s2">distributed exponential tech right how</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:54.260" style="s2">do how do we have resilience and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:58.200" style="s2">antifragility in the presence of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.260" end="00:49:01.170" style="s2">well most answers to that go Orwellian</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.200" end="00:49:02.490" style="s2">in a hurry ooh big word it&#39;s Universal</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.170" end="00:49:03.780" style="s2">surveillance you know who&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.490" end="00:49:07.110" style="s2">to be able to shut it down because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.780" end="00:49:08.970" style="s2">can&#39;t let it happen right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.110" end="00:49:11.970" style="s2">already a fan state because that level</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.970" end="00:49:14.070" style="s2">of disco hearin stress perspective leads</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.970" end="00:49:17.910" style="s2">to fields help say for other reasons in</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.070" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">dystopian so the only answer we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.910" end="00:49:25.080" style="s2">make it through our power curve involves</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:26.580" style="s2">we space involved a radical upregulation</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.080" end="00:49:28.920" style="s2">of people knowing each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.580" end="00:49:30.450" style="s2">knowing when someone is off no one being</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.920" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">that off because they feel so isolated</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.450" end="00:49:36.470" style="s2">and disenfranchised and existential</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:38.820" style="s2">angst Ville right and that being</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.470" end="00:49:41.250" style="s2">structurally built in a way where it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.820" end="00:49:42.510" style="s2">ubiquitous we actually have no</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.250" end="00:49:46.560" style="s2">making it through that doesn&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.510" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">that at the center now let me say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.560" end="00:49:49.290" style="s2">another way because I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:51.720" style="s2">valuable to think of it this way you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.290" end="00:49:55.110" style="s2">mentioned moving from finite to infinite</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.720" end="00:49:57.330" style="s2">games and if there&#39;s anyone who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.110" end="00:50:00.510" style="s2">read that book it&#39;s a classic finding</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.330" end="00:50:02.610" style="s2">infinite games to come into I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.510" end="00:50:06.750" style="s2">speak to it in a even more popular and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.610" end="00:50:11.940" style="s2">simple way which is all finite games are</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.750" end="00:50:15.600" style="s2">win-lose games we&#39;re actually coming to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.940" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">an end of when lose game theory at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.600" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">social level and this is actually a key</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:23.340" style="s2">way of thinking about we space on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:24.660" style="s2">sports team we create a sense of we with</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.340" end="00:50:27.270" style="s2">our team and we&#39;ll have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.660" end="00:50:28.650" style="s2">coherence with each other to beat to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.270" end="00:50:30.540" style="s2">beat the other ones and we have a bay</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.650" end="00:50:33.570" style="s2">with them right so we get to do in-group</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.540" end="00:50:35.580" style="s2">out-group mentality now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.570" end="00:50:37.320" style="s2">training - for kids to be good at that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.580" end="00:50:41.370" style="s2">psychology for when it&#39;s time for war</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.320" end="00:50:45.270" style="s2">and you know whatever else frame go back</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.370" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">to tribes event the time of tribes would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.270" end="00:50:49.500" style="s2">create coherence with each other to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:51.720" style="s2">able to be competitive with another</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.500" end="00:50:53.700" style="s2">tribe if need be now if there&#39;s low</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.720" end="00:50:55.710" style="s2">population relative to lots of resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.700" end="00:50:57.450" style="s2">we&#39;re all cool with each other if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.710" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">population gets high relative to not</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.450" end="00:51:00.120" style="s2">that many resources we start raising</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:03.330" style="s2">that kill and the other people is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.120" end="00:51:04.590" style="s2">viable strategy and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.330" end="00:51:07.590" style="s2">out-compete them for the scarce</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.590" end="00:51:09.330" style="s2">resources also and so those are two</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.590" end="00:51:11.010" style="s2">methods of competing now compete them</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.330" end="00:51:14.190" style="s2">for scarce resources and directly</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.010" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">militarily attack now throughout all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.190" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">history two things have been true one</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:21.480" style="s2">this strategy worked</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">you actually could kill the other people</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.480" end="00:51:25.980" style="s2">get the river front and life is better</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:28.290" style="s2">for you and your people and two if</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.980" end="00:51:30.290" style="s2">anyone else played win lose games you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.290" end="00:51:32.580" style="s2">had two or lose by default</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.290" end="00:51:34.290" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t create a military and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.580" end="00:51:35.670" style="s2">anyone else has realized this killing</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.290" end="00:51:39.000" style="s2">other people thinking works didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.670" end="00:51:42.590" style="s2">just die by default and so militaristic</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.000" end="00:51:46.560" style="s2">win lose games have been necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.590" end="00:51:47.820" style="s2">then a couple tribes joined together to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.560" end="00:51:49.140" style="s2">be able to fight the bigger tribe they</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.820" end="00:51:50.790" style="s2">couldn&#39;t fight and so then you get more</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.140" end="00:51:53.160" style="s2">tribes banding together so now we get</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.790" end="00:51:54.570" style="s2">villages and kingdoms and nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.160" end="00:51:58.050" style="s2">and global economic trading</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.570" end="00:52:00.630" style="s2">and the tools of commerce increase we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.050" end="00:52:03.120" style="s2">get fiat currencies fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.630" end="00:52:04.830" style="s2">banking etc to increase our power our</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.120" end="00:52:06.270" style="s2">tools of extraction of resource from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.830" end="00:52:08.760" style="s2">environment and our military tools</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.270" end="00:52:12.030" style="s2">increase this is just upping the ante on</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.760" end="00:52:13.740" style="s2">win-lose games right until we have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.030" end="00:52:15.150" style="s2">biggest players we can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.740" end="00:52:17.220" style="s2">have with the biggest tech we can have</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.150" end="00:52:18.750" style="s2">in both our ability to compete for</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.220" end="00:52:20.910" style="s2">scarce resource and to direct attack</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.750" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">each other we need it but you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.910" end="00:52:27.870" style="s2">place about now where you have so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:29.700" style="s2">power that you can no longer win that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.870" end="00:52:33.330" style="s2">winning requires destroying the playing</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.700" end="00:52:35.250" style="s2">field equals losing and if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.330" end="00:52:36.810" style="s2">out-compete each other for the scarce</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.250" end="00:52:39.170" style="s2">resource we just ruin the biosphere its</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.810" end="00:52:41.550" style="s2">capacity to support us and we give then</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.170" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">massive migrations of humans causing</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.550" end="00:52:45.090" style="s2">Wars and everything else and if we try</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:46.770" style="s2">and actually beat each other with our</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.090" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">military technologies everybody dies</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.770" end="00:52:50.310" style="s2">because we have way too much military</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:52.620" style="s2">technology that&#39;s never been true before</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.310" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">war always worked out competing them for</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.620" end="00:52:57.810" style="s2">resource always worked it will never</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:59.580" style="s2">work again and so we&#39;re at a place where</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.810" end="00:53:01.620" style="s2">win lose game theory which equals</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.580" end="00:53:03.180" style="s2">strategy the word strategy means win</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.620" end="00:53:05.670" style="s2">lose game theory how to be effective in</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.180" end="00:53:07.620" style="s2">the news game that&#39;s like all military</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.670" end="00:53:11.150" style="s2">strategy and business strategy derived</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.620" end="00:53:14.040" style="s2">from military strategy that&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.150" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">because that becomes Omni lose-lose so</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.040" end="00:53:18.570" style="s2">either we figure out AMI win-win which</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">means how do we meet needs while meeting</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.570" end="00:53:21.780" style="s2">the needs of everyone else involved and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:24.390" style="s2">the biosphere without externalizing harm</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.780" end="00:53:28.230" style="s2">at all either we figure that out or our</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.390" end="00:53:29.790" style="s2">species has finished its experiment so</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.230" end="00:53:33.420" style="s2">what does that mean from a we space as</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.790" end="00:53:36.660" style="s2">it means there is no other so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.420" end="00:53:39.990" style="s2">actually have to get off in-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.660" end="00:53:42.660" style="s2">out-group mentality there is no answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.990" end="00:53:45.540" style="s2">to making it through our technological</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.660" end="00:53:46.770" style="s2">capacity an existential risk without</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.540" end="00:53:50.840" style="s2">getting past in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.770" end="00:53:50.840" style="s2">mentality and having an all be in-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.079" end="00:54:02.009" style="s2">so by developing the capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.119" end="00:54:05.439" style="s2">together capacity to trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.009" end="00:54:07.959" style="s2">capacity to in these moments where we</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.959" end="00:54:12.249" style="s2">probably a good idea for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.149" end="00:54:17.949" style="s2">starting deeper relationships with one</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.249" end="00:54:19.749" style="s2">another for all the people who thought</p>

<p begin="00:54:39.519" end="00:54:44.439" style="s2">adaptive at all you will lose all</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.510" end="00:55:39.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to see it&#39;s a hope because</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:44.940" style="s2">pro feels a bit passive but to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.240" end="00:55:47.370" style="s2">place of opportunity within ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.940" end="00:55:51.990" style="s2">come into these times and leave our own</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.370" end="00:55:53.430" style="s2">you to our own not I would say it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.990" end="00:55:55.500" style="s2">like Hollywood shows us all this</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.430" end="00:55:57.960" style="s2">dystopias and they seem to be fun and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.500" end="00:56:00.210" style="s2">when will you talk about utopias and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.960" end="00:56:06.570" style="s2">would have utopic movies probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.210" end="00:56:09.240" style="s2">nowhere it would go right you know so</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.570" end="00:56:12.270" style="s2">but if we can hold that together that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.240" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">can go into that curve that we can lift</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.270" end="00:56:16.800" style="s2">each other up we couldn&#39;t compete</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:19.770" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t one another through the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.800" end="00:56:22.080" style="s2">creation of community through the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.770" end="00:56:24.690" style="s2">creation of relationship with people</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.080" end="00:56:26.850" style="s2">that we don&#39;t necessarily want to relate</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.690" end="00:56:28.830" style="s2">with or they&#39;re not the same of us or</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.850" end="00:56:30.840" style="s2">they don&#39;t sure it&#39;s excitable use but</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.830" end="00:56:35.790" style="s2">it seems that is the time for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.840" end="00:56:38.970" style="s2">over our edges with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.790" end="00:56:41.010" style="s2">enter and try to do those weak spaces</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.970" end="00:56:44.070" style="s2">with the people that are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.010" end="00:56:47.340" style="s2">similar to us this is the key part I</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.070" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">want people to give it&#39;s so easy for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.340" end="00:56:51.540" style="s2">to reach a point of what seems like</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.610" style="s2">fundamental disagreement and then just</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.540" end="00:56:56.250" style="s2">disconnect I&#39;m not gonna hang out with</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.610" end="00:56:58.410" style="s2">this person for I&#39;m not gonna hang out</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.250" end="00:57:00.630" style="s2">this group of people or them let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.410" end="00:57:03.120" style="s2">start a war or let&#39;s just ignore them</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.630" end="00:57:06.770" style="s2">right let&#39;s just get rid of those people</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.120" end="00:57:10.290" style="s2">because they are actively bad to us</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.770" end="00:57:11.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work anymore we actually can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.290" end="00:57:13.140" style="s2">win those wars because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.880" end="00:57:15.180" style="s2">people that think that whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.140" end="00:57:18.210" style="s2">thing is and they have exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.180" end="00:57:19.770" style="s2">- and as soon as you realize that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.210" end="00:57:23.100" style="s2">shared the planet and we actually can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.770" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">get the other groups off then you say</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.100" end="00:57:27.360" style="s2"> I&#39;ve got to actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:29.850" style="s2">what is it that is meaningful to them</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.360" end="00:57:32.090" style="s2">and add a value and where can we build</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.850" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">bridges and the whole just</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.090" end="00:57:37.400" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m going to not interact with them</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:39.610" style="s2">and them that just doesn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.400" end="00:57:46.580" style="s2">so then you start asking more questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.610" end="00:57:57.710" style="s2">and you open up your willingness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.580" end="00:57:59.990" style="s2">capacity for understanding understanding</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.710" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">bridge building what so what is their</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.990" end="00:58:03.620" style="s2">understanding of bridge building and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:06.500" style="s2">where are transition technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.620" end="00:58:10.780" style="s2">you see already happening that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.500" end="00:58:13.670" style="s2">can start to be aware of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.780" end="00:58:15.680" style="s2">prototyping a very interesting process</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.670" end="00:58:21.170" style="s2">of sense making right now that involves</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.680" end="00:58:22.070" style="s2">human sensors and I&#39;ll tell you one step</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.170" end="00:58:25.190" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.070" end="00:58:27.770" style="s2">partner partner mine forest land</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.190" end="00:58:31.490" style="s2">redevelop this Partners got a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.770" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">beautiful insight so group of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.490" end="00:58:35.060" style="s2">come together for governance for choice</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:36.440" style="s2">making you can&#39;t do choice make them</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.060" end="00:58:38.570" style="s2">before you&#39;ve done since making because</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.440" end="00:58:41.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what the to do right</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.570" end="00:58:44.420" style="s2">you and so one of the one thing we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.720" end="00:58:47.770" style="s2">say is that if your governance system</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.420" end="00:58:50.600" style="s2">involves voting it&#39;s already broken</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.770" end="00:58:52.660" style="s2">because voting means that some things</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.600" end="00:58:54.830" style="s2">that are valuable are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.660" end="00:58:55.970" style="s2">benefited at the cost of other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.830" end="00:58:58.040" style="s2">that are valuable and we&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.970" end="00:59:00.110" style="s2">who values which ones more again in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.040" end="00:59:01.430" style="s2">exponential curve world that just</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.110" end="00:59:03.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work whenever things are being</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.430" end="00:59:05.390" style="s2">harmed and they&#39;re becoming catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.010" end="00:59:07.000" style="s2">and you polarized the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.390" end="00:59:09.050" style="s2">associated with the different values so</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.000" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">typically when we have a choice to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.050" end="00:59:12.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like do we vote yes or no on this</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.300" style="s2">proposition both sides suck because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.980" end="00:59:16.760" style="s2">was a welfare it was a ill firm</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.300" end="00:59:18.800" style="s2">proposition right so he factory we get</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.760" end="00:59:19.970" style="s2">the we get the economics but we destroy</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.800" end="00:59:22.100" style="s2">the environment or we keep the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.970" end="00:59:23.420" style="s2">environment destroy the economy we</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.100" end="00:59:25.580" style="s2">actually need to do a better job of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.420" end="00:59:27.350" style="s2">understanding everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.580" end="00:59:29.060" style="s2">meaningful regarding this decision and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.350" end="00:59:30.800" style="s2">all that&#39;s interconnected first and take</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.060" end="00:59:33.620" style="s2">all those as designed constraints to an</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.800" end="00:59:35.630" style="s2">integrated design process and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.620" end="00:59:37.340" style="s2">a sense making that proceeds a choice</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.630" end="00:59:39.550" style="s2">making and so part of how this process</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.340" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">works is group of people come together</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.550" end="00:59:45.510" style="s2">to do the sense making regarding an</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:49.049" style="s2">issue and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.510" end="00:59:51.799" style="s2">the issue is do we build this bridge or</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.049" end="00:59:54.109" style="s2">not right or the issue is what is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.799" end="00:59:56.220" style="s2">adequate governance system or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.109" end="00:59:59.250" style="s2">so we start with a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.220" end="01:00:00.900" style="s2">questions right we have a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.250" end="01:00:07.380" style="s2">questions that are relevant to answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.900" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">this and so the question might be let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.380" end="01:00:11.339" style="s2">say we&#39;re asking say we were leading one</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:12.930" style="s2">on governance itself what do we think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.339" end="01:00:14.910" style="s2">liquid democracy what do we think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.930" end="01:00:17.369" style="s2">voting currencies what do we think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.910" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">non voting systems what do we what are</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.369" end="01:00:21.210" style="s2">the strengths and weaknesses of dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:22.290" style="s2">governance or socio Krissy you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.210" end="01:00:24.180" style="s2">whatever right you have a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.290" end="01:00:27.780" style="s2">fittings what about when is meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.180" end="01:00:30.359" style="s2">useful versus consensus so then you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.780" end="01:00:31.770" style="s2">all these questions and then people that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.359" end="01:00:36.540" style="s2">are interested in those questions break</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.770" end="01:00:38.339" style="s2">off into small groups and they ask a few</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.540" end="01:00:39.990" style="s2">questions related to that question one</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.339" end="01:00:41.670" style="s2">question is in order to answer this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.990" end="01:00:43.799" style="s2">question what additional questions would</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.670" end="01:00:46.829" style="s2">we have to ask and there&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.799" end="01:00:50.010" style="s2">that is facilitated well I guess in</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.829" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">order to to you know answer that</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.010" end="01:00:55.170" style="s2">question regarding say is a voting</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:57.299" style="s2">currency a good system we&#39;d have to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.170" end="01:01:00.839" style="s2">well what what are the effects of voting</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.299" end="01:01:04.500" style="s2">systems at all and how do we define what</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.839" end="01:01:06.059" style="s2">kind of choice should be benefited or</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.500" end="01:01:07.950" style="s2">are there different kinds of choices</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.059" end="01:01:09.510" style="s2">that need different kinds of governance</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.950" end="01:01:10.680" style="s2">systems and how do we relate it to sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.510" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">makes it and you start to find there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.680" end="01:01:14.790" style="s2">whole taxonomy of questions underneath</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:16.470" style="s2">it that you just either didn&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.790" end="01:01:18.780" style="s2">attention to or you assumed the answers</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.470" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">to now everyone in the group will have</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.780" end="01:01:21.930" style="s2">different insights as to what questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:23.880" style="s2">what is the level of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.930" end="01:01:26.220" style="s2">training of the people that are involved</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.880" end="01:01:27.630" style="s2">in order to be able to engage in it how</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.220" end="01:01:28.710" style="s2">much civic engagement training is</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.630" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">necessary whatever at all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.710" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">questions and then you also ask what</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:36.780" style="s2">underlying assumptions are there and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:39.059" style="s2">what is ultimately meaningful that this</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.780" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">is trying to address now as you go</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.059" end="01:01:43.049" style="s2">around in a structured process no one is</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:45.240" style="s2">actually giving answers anywhere and no</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.049" end="01:01:47.579" style="s2">one is proposing strategies they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.240" end="01:01:49.859" style="s2">saying this question has these other</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.579" end="01:01:50.910" style="s2">questions connected and then everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.859" end="01:01:52.710" style="s2">gets be like oh I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.910" end="01:01:53.970" style="s2">even thought of that question oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.710" end="01:01:56.069" style="s2">interesting and because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.970" end="01:01:58.049" style="s2">jumping straight to vote you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.069" end="01:01:59.340" style="s2">pissed off that I want this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.049" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s going to take away</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.340" end="01:02:02.700" style="s2">from your thing you get to say well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:04.860" style="s2">I guess but Adele&#39;s are interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.700" end="01:02:09.000" style="s2">right if there is a way of doing it that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.860" end="01:02:11.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t damage my kid getting a job and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.000" end="01:02:13.380" style="s2">oh I guess I do have that assumption</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.400" end="01:02:14.700" style="s2">underneath it and I guess this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.380" end="01:02:15.720" style="s2">actually what&#39;s meaningful to me well</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.700" end="01:02:16.980" style="s2">should the things that they said are</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.720" end="01:02:20.520" style="s2">meaningful to them or meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.980" end="01:02:22.470" style="s2">too so in the process not only does a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.520" end="01:02:24.360" style="s2">huge amount of information get surfaced</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.470" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">that then can go into a choice making</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.360" end="01:02:29.490" style="s2">process that can lead to better choices</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:32.310" style="s2">but all of the people understood each</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.490" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">other better and they actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.310" end="01:02:37.140" style="s2">understood how to do an aspect of we</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:40.200" style="s2">space better which is they understood</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.140" end="01:02:41.880" style="s2">how to notice their own assumptions how</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.200" end="01:02:44.190" style="s2">to notice what&#39;s actually meaningful to</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.880" end="01:02:46.590" style="s2">them that is driving where their emotion</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.190" end="01:02:48.330" style="s2">is and how to ask more questions and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.590" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">they became more you know educated about</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.330" end="01:02:52.440" style="s2">the topic and they they do this a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:54.690" style="s2">of times they start to take for granted</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.440" end="01:02:55.740" style="s2">that there&#39;s a huge amount of stuff they</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.690" end="01:02:58.350" style="s2">don&#39;t know about everything they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.740" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">passionate about and they start to take</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.350" end="01:03:00.930" style="s2">for granted that other people that have</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:02.190" style="s2">perspectives that they thought they</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.930" end="01:03:03.720" style="s2">would have differed with actually have</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.190" end="01:03:06.840" style="s2">meaningful things to share that baby can</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.720" end="01:03:08.790" style="s2">know via going through that process so</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.840" end="01:03:10.230" style="s2">of course we end up surfacing some</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.790" end="01:03:11.730" style="s2">sense-making in the form of documents</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.230" end="01:03:13.380" style="s2">but we surface sense-making in the form</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.730" end="01:03:16.350" style="s2">of all of the people being better sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.380" end="01:03:18.120" style="s2">makers are you actually training a kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.350" end="01:03:20.100" style="s2">of civic engagement so when you ask what</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.120" end="01:03:22.440" style="s2">are some tools or processes to be able</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.100" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">to help people actually connect and</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.440" end="01:03:29.040" style="s2">relate better that&#39;s this one example</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:30.900" style="s2">and just said okay so it&#39;s like by is</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.040" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">trying to develop selves bacon by</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.900" end="01:03:34.830" style="s2">developing more sense making in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:36.930" style="s2">forms of questions and then starts by</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.830" end="01:03:39.420" style="s2">asking those questions and then helping</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.930" end="01:03:41.250" style="s2">people to actually relate first to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.420" end="01:03:44.130" style="s2">instead of trying to get into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.250" end="01:03:45.990" style="s2">answers by doing that they create some</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.130" end="01:03:47.790" style="s2">empathic connection because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.990" end="01:03:49.470" style="s2">nothing to oppose there are just</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.790" end="01:03:53.160" style="s2">questions so we&#39;re just sort of seeing</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.470" end="01:03:55.980" style="s2">that which we don&#39;t know and then but</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.160" end="01:03:57.900" style="s2">then how do you go from that because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.980" end="01:04:00.120" style="s2">know in the inner when we do collective</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.900" end="01:04:02.910" style="s2">intelligence processes we can have all</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.120" end="01:04:05.310" style="s2">these huge amounts of data and this huge</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.910" end="01:04:08.160" style="s2">amount of harvesting but I tend to think</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.310" end="01:04:11.640" style="s2">about it like in in form of a spiral</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.160" end="01:04:13.049" style="s2">right so we go from the outer to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.640" end="01:04:15.299" style="s2">inside and the ins</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.049" end="01:04:17.609" style="s2">well we want to find that answer to our</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.299" end="01:04:20.249" style="s2">question and sometimes what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.609" end="01:04:22.769" style="s2">that people are not able to then see the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.249" end="01:04:25.259" style="s2">whole of what is emerging in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.769" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">makes sense we can develop a huge map</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.259" end="01:04:30.059" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean people will be</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:32.219" style="s2">able to make sense of that map so how</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.059" end="01:04:34.979" style="s2">what is the process in which you go into</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.219" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">that kind of huge amount of data and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.979" end="01:04:43.439" style="s2">questions into the actual more focused</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:46.729" style="s2">way of sense making from that to this</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.439" end="01:04:50.039" style="s2">seeing what you&#39;re actually want to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.729" end="01:04:52.499" style="s2">yeah so the second simplicity on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.039" end="01:04:54.959" style="s2">other side of the complexity is actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.499" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">an integrated design right so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.959" end="01:04:59.130" style="s2">surface all of this complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:01.369" style="s2">questions and of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.130" end="01:05:04.019" style="s2">meaningful and things that matter right</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.369" end="01:05:07.289" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately gonna create a series</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.019" end="01:05:09.539" style="s2">of design constraints right for sure and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.289" end="01:05:12.989" style="s2">then the design constraints are going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.539" end="01:05:15.659" style="s2">be the beginning of a integrated design</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.989" end="01:05:17.279" style="s2">process and the simplicity the choice</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.659" end="01:05:21.149" style="s2">that&#39;s made is actually a design that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.279" end="01:05:23.429" style="s2">meets all the design constraints and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.149" end="01:05:27.389" style="s2">the future of governance and economics</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.429" end="01:05:31.609" style="s2">actually here is around integrated</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.389" end="01:05:35.159" style="s2">design this is a really different thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.609" end="01:05:37.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not optimization and it&#39;s not game</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.159" end="01:05:39.809" style="s2">theory so when we think of optimization</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.799" end="01:05:43.409" style="s2">right we say okay we have a we have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.809" end="01:05:45.089" style="s2">system and there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.409" end="01:05:47.489" style="s2">different needs that need met and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.089" end="01:05:49.079" style="s2">got you know I have my government budget</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.489" end="01:05:50.279" style="s2">my state budget or my federal budget or</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.079" end="01:05:51.749" style="s2">whatever it is and I&#39;ve got military</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.279" end="01:05:53.009" style="s2">needs and healthcare needs and all these</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.749" end="01:05:54.149" style="s2">things where I have a company and I have</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.009" end="01:05:56.189" style="s2">our total amount of money and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.149" end="01:05:58.829" style="s2">marketing needs and HR needs and product</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.189" end="01:06:01.829" style="s2">needs and R&amp;D needs but now I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.829" end="01:06:04.380" style="s2">allocate the resources the same scare</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.829" end="01:06:06.689" style="s2">seemingly competitive resources to each</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.380" end="01:06:08.219" style="s2">of the different areas in light of what</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.689" end="01:06:09.449" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to do in that area how</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.219" end="01:06:10.919" style="s2">it all comes together that will create</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.449" end="01:06:13.519" style="s2">the best whole I&#39;m thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.919" end="01:06:16.909" style="s2">whole from an optimization point of view</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.519" end="01:06:19.769" style="s2">so we look for global Optimum&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.909" end="01:06:20.939" style="s2">when we look for Nash equilibriums and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.769" end="01:06:23.399" style="s2">things like that that&#39;s kind of how</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.939" end="01:06:25.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve done it that will definitely not</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.399" end="01:06:30.130" style="s2">work moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.990" end="01:06:34.660" style="s2">and for a few reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.130" end="01:06:38.829" style="s2">one is when we think about optimization</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.660" end="01:06:40.690" style="s2">we are assuming that we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.829" end="01:06:43.390" style="s2">theory of trade-offs that the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.690" end="01:06:44.980" style="s2">resource going to this area is taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.390" end="01:06:46.539" style="s2">away from this area and coming here</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.980" end="01:06:48.039" style="s2">here&#39;s taking away from this one which</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.539" end="01:06:49.510" style="s2">when you actually get into integrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.039" end="01:06:51.910" style="s2">design where you look at the synergy</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.510" end="01:06:54.010" style="s2">possibility of how can these things be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.910" end="01:06:55.329" style="s2">mutually beneficial it&#39;s not about how</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.010" end="01:06:57.069" style="s2">much resource goes here and here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.329" end="01:06:59.079" style="s2">about what is a design that works for</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.069" end="01:07:00.730" style="s2">both of these things together better</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.079" end="01:07:05.410" style="s2">than the inside of either of them on</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.730" end="01:07:07.779" style="s2">their own would have and so as long as</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.410" end="01:07:10.180" style="s2">we have underlying theory of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.779" end="01:07:12.460" style="s2">we will have people that are associating</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.180" end="01:07:14.980" style="s2">with whatever value metric they care</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.460" end="01:07:16.809" style="s2">about particularly and will continue to</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.980" end="01:07:18.069" style="s2">radicalize and polarize people just</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.809" end="01:07:21.400" style="s2">through the underlying theory of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.069" end="01:07:23.740" style="s2">trade-offs though the key is not how do</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.400" end="01:07:25.809" style="s2">we top-down allocate or how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.740" end="01:07:28.539" style="s2">bottom-up have a bunch of agents to try</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.809" end="01:07:30.549" style="s2">to find Nash equilibriums it&#39;s how does</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.539" end="01:07:33.430" style="s2">everyone surface what is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.549" end="01:07:35.140" style="s2">meaningful to them and we take all these</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.430" end="01:07:37.329" style="s2">sources of meaningfulness as design</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.140" end="01:07:40.450" style="s2">constraints and then we go into a</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.329" end="01:07:41.559" style="s2">collaborative design process with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.450" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">people who have the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.559" end="01:07:46.329" style="s2">capabilities for that particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:48.460" style="s2">thing and a design that meets all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.329" end="01:07:52.809" style="s2">design constraints can move forward with</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.460" end="01:07:55.720" style="s2">consent Wow so that&#39;s how would you</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.809" end="01:07:57.940" style="s2">describe integrated design when we go</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.720" end="01:08:00.039" style="s2">from the sense making into identifying</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.940" end="01:08:03.670" style="s2">the design constraints and then we find</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.039" end="01:08:07.029" style="s2">the most simple elegant way of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.670" end="01:08:09.190" style="s2">those design constraints and what about</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.029" end="01:08:11.950" style="s2">paradox what about those design</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.190" end="01:08:14.260" style="s2">constraints that come from paradoxical</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.950" end="01:08:15.940" style="s2">sets of needs some people may think they</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.260" end="01:08:18.009" style="s2">need this and another people think they</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.940" end="01:08:22.540" style="s2">need it and there&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.009" end="01:08:25.270" style="s2">opposition of that so always false</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.540" end="01:08:28.359" style="s2">dichotomy and the key there is to move</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.270" end="01:08:31.949" style="s2">from false dichotomy into dialectic and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.359" end="01:08:35.049" style="s2">then synthesis on the dialectic and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.949" end="01:08:37.569" style="s2">people strategies for how to meet a need</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.049" end="01:08:38.859" style="s2">will be fundamentally and reconcilable</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.569" end="01:08:40.330" style="s2">but the actual need</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.859" end="01:08:41.670" style="s2">will not be fundamentally unreconciled</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.330" end="01:08:44.199" style="s2">also we have to be able to tease apart</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.670" end="01:08:47.049" style="s2">the strategy for how to meet the need in</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.199" end="01:08:48.429" style="s2">the actual need and so this is again</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.049" end="01:08:50.290" style="s2">where we get into assumptions right</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.429" end="01:08:53.259" style="s2">there&#39;s an assumption that this</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.290" end="01:08:57.369" style="s2">particular strategy is the way to meet</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.259" end="01:08:59.409" style="s2">that need and there is a meaningful -</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.369" end="01:09:02.199" style="s2">right what is actually meaningful here</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.409" end="01:09:04.029" style="s2">well okay so my strategy to meet the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.199" end="01:09:05.049" style="s2">need for freedom is lays a fair free</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.029" end="01:09:07.000" style="s2">market capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.049" end="01:09:10.330" style="s2">well no but my strategy for the way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.000" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">meeting my need for tending to though</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.330" end="01:09:15.880" style="s2">tending to the disabled and those who</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:18.489" style="s2">are in you know harder off positions</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.880" end="01:09:21.130" style="s2">intending to the Commons as Marxism well</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.489" end="01:09:23.949" style="s2">no that&#39;s like over the strategies and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.130" end="01:09:26.409" style="s2">say what I care about is individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.949" end="01:09:29.350" style="s2">freedom and sovereignty me and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.409" end="01:09:31.690" style="s2">creative capacity of the individual what</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.350" end="01:09:33.819" style="s2">I care about is the Commons and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.690" end="01:09:35.679" style="s2">Commonwealth and those who are not in</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.819" end="01:09:37.029" style="s2">positions to be able to fully take care</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.679" end="01:09:39.569" style="s2">of themselves sovereignly being taken</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.029" end="01:09:41.560" style="s2">care of great those are not in</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.569" end="01:09:44.350" style="s2">fundamental dichotomy with each other</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.560" end="01:09:46.659" style="s2">yeah but the strategies to fulfill them</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.350" end="01:09:48.489" style="s2">might be in fundamental dichotomy so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.659" end="01:09:50.409" style="s2">come to what is fundamentally meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.489" end="01:09:52.929" style="s2">and ultimately what we end up finding is</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.409" end="01:09:56.290" style="s2">that the same things are meaningful to</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.929" end="01:09:57.790" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s not obvious at all but</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.290" end="01:09:59.230" style="s2">everything that is actually meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.790" end="01:10:03.190" style="s2">when you strip the strategy way is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.230" end="01:10:04.989" style="s2">meaningful to everyone now that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.190" end="01:10:06.730" style="s2">process of Revelation that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.989" end="01:10:09.369" style="s2">all have the same values which is all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.730" end="01:10:13.179" style="s2">them right everything fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.369" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">valuable then we get to say how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.179" end="01:10:19.090" style="s2">an integrated design strategy it meets</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:21.400" style="s2">both of these things simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.090" end="01:10:23.980" style="s2">takes them out of being seen as</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.400" end="01:10:26.440" style="s2">paradoxical right out of being seen as</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.980" end="01:10:29.130" style="s2">fundamentally dichotomous because we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.440" end="01:10:29.130" style="s2">meet them both simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.450" end="01:10:47.140" style="s2">I&#39;m so happy</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.160" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">during this world they mail and - so how</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.140" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">far is this initiative and is there</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:54.730" style="s2">gonna be tools or is there gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:57.160" style="s2">process that will help people to do the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.730" end="01:10:58.900" style="s2">sense-making and and and you plan to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.160" end="01:11:01.570" style="s2">release that process or is there a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.900" end="01:11:04.390" style="s2">certain technology certain tool that</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.570" end="01:11:05.590" style="s2">would help to do that and in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.390" end="01:11:08.560" style="s2">beginning I think I heard you say</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.590" end="01:11:10.720" style="s2">sensors but that I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.560" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">applies to sense-making order to actual</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.720" end="01:11:17.800" style="s2">sensors yes there I was saying human</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:19.350" style="s2">sensors meaning that we&#39;re not in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.800" end="01:11:22.840" style="s2">particular process we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.350" end="01:11:25.660" style="s2">humans as things that have sensed into</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.840" end="01:11:27.400" style="s2">the world around them and can then share</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.660" end="01:11:31.000" style="s2">their sense making and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.400" end="01:11:33.880" style="s2">way of being able to synthesize very</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.000" end="01:11:37.750" style="s2">harvesting something as opposed to sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.880" end="01:11:40.060" style="s2">making from say data mining on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.750" end="01:11:41.860" style="s2">internet or physical sensors which are</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.060" end="01:11:46.180" style="s2">also important and where you know they</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.860" end="01:11:49.030" style="s2">those all need combined when we start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.180" end="01:11:50.860" style="s2">talk about the future of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.030" end="01:11:58.330" style="s2">physical sensors are actually a major</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.860" end="01:12:00.160" style="s2">part of a self adapting system the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.330" end="01:12:02.410" style="s2">system I was just sharing of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.160" end="01:12:05.620" style="s2">small group sense making process has</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.410" end="01:12:07.030" style="s2">gone through architecture which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.620" end="01:12:10.090" style="s2">actually very non-trivial as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.030" end="01:12:13.030" style="s2">hearing it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a small</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.090" end="01:12:15.190" style="s2">adaptation of holacracy or so she offers</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.030" end="01:12:17.170" style="s2">here some other thing it was starting by</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.190" end="01:12:21.730" style="s2">reverse engineering from the actual</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.170" end="01:12:23.560" style="s2">social dynamic means and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.730" end="01:12:26.530" style="s2">there&#39;s several different processes that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.560" end="01:12:28.150" style="s2">was one of them and just started to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.530" end="01:12:30.370" style="s2">into prototyping and now there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.150" end="01:12:34.000" style="s2">of prototype work to do and I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.370" end="01:12:35.380" style="s2">actually love to have people from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.000" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">you know collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.380" end="01:12:41.590" style="s2">communities especially if they were</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:43.780" style="s2">interested in helping to develop these</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.590" end="01:12:48.180" style="s2">things further to do so because you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.780" end="01:12:49.340" style="s2">a lot of work is needed yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.180" end="01:12:50.929" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.340" end="01:12:53.960" style="s2">just as you were saying that I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.929" end="01:12:56.150" style="s2">thinking about how to then enhance the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.960" end="01:12:58.730" style="s2">capacity of the sensors right and how do</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.150" end="01:13:00.170" style="s2">you do that when you enter in collecting</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.730" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">intelligence because we can operate here</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.170" end="01:13:04.250" style="s2">and we can interview our peers or we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:06.739" style="s2">enter through our emotion or we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.250" end="01:13:08.510" style="s2">enter that we can bring our whole selves</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.739" end="01:13:10.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s literally all the good and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.510" end="01:13:13.699" style="s2">the bad and the ugly and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.130" end="01:13:16.280" style="s2">and so when you prepare a collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.699" end="01:13:19.849" style="s2">field like if you think about the we</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.280" end="01:13:22.940" style="s2">spaces preview part of who of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.849" end="01:13:26.510" style="s2">practices are developing collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.940" end="01:13:28.940" style="s2">sentence I&#39;m developing a way on on how</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.510" end="01:13:31.099" style="s2">we connect to each other so deeply but</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.940" end="01:13:35.119" style="s2">also to the center to do that which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.099" end="01:13:38.570" style="s2">bigger than ourselves and then through</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.119" end="01:13:41.179" style="s2">that when we have reached a certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.570" end="01:13:43.940" style="s2">space where where were literally buzzing</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.179" end="01:13:47.290" style="s2">like we literally feel the space is</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.940" end="01:13:50.150" style="s2">impregnated with our beingness together</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.290" end="01:13:52.610" style="s2">with our easiness in that particular</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.150" end="01:13:55.280" style="s2">moment of the collective and then we go</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.610" end="01:13:57.590" style="s2">to the mind then more powerful things</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.280" end="01:13:59.960" style="s2">can happen and I feel that bad when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.590" end="01:14:02.270" style="s2">mix that and I experience when you mix</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.960" end="01:14:04.639" style="s2">that with music let&#39;s say that in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.270" end="01:14:06.380" style="s2">certain point the group reach the limit</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.639" end="01:14:09.949" style="s2">of their sensing and then you bring an</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.380" end="01:14:11.690" style="s2">important piece of music or art or so</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.949" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">that that you have meant the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.690" end="01:14:16.280" style="s2">possibilities of the right brain and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:18.380" style="s2">left brain interaction in the space and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.280" end="01:14:20.929" style="s2">the body so I would say that it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.380" end="01:14:23.239" style="s2">have to be larger than the mind it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.929" end="01:14:26.000" style="s2">have to involve all of who we are so</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.239" end="01:14:29.320" style="s2">that our scent source are really fully</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.000" end="01:14:33.139" style="s2">activated and that would be my answer I</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.320" end="01:14:38.170" style="s2">think that is beautiful and desirable</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.139" end="01:14:38.170" style="s2">and not necessary for everyone to start</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.300" end="01:14:48.369" style="s2">you&#39;re describing a kind of all level</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.310" end="01:15:19.400" style="s2">the interconnectivity and the</p>

<p begin="01:15:23.030" end="01:15:27.199" style="s2">can start making choices lined with that</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:29.300" style="s2">and they can develop those other types</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.199" end="01:15:31.820" style="s2">of intelligence I say this because I</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.300" end="01:15:34.130" style="s2">find that some groups that I connect</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.820" end="01:15:37.130" style="s2">with should all do ayahuasca together</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.130" end="01:15:38.750" style="s2">and then all dance together and have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.130" end="01:15:40.340" style="s2">snuggle party and like you can connect</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.750" end="01:15:42.770" style="s2">them that way and then they do strategy</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.340" end="01:15:44.570" style="s2">in their other groups of autists who</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.770" end="01:15:48.620" style="s2">actually do really good strategy</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.570" end="01:15:52.850" style="s2">together just by starting with data and</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.620" end="01:15:54.679" style="s2">so I want to make it as deep and rich as</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.850" end="01:15:58.460" style="s2">possible and as widely appealing as</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.679" end="01:16:00.890" style="s2">possible thank you that addresses that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.460" end="01:16:03.320" style="s2">we are unique and that there is</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.890" end="01:16:05.810" style="s2">displaces for uniqueness and then the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.320" end="01:16:07.370" style="s2">places where certain groups yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.810" end="01:16:11.360" style="s2">that that you know one of the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.370" end="01:16:14.300" style="s2">recordings that that I did on fury of</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.360" end="01:16:16.280" style="s2">the embodied we with Erica is brown or</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.300" end="01:16:21.260" style="s2">Arthur broad and they were speaking</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.280" end="01:16:23.840" style="s2">about certain practices like game</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.260" end="01:16:26.179" style="s2">shifting to make some words that create</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.840" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">collective awareness of where we are at</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.179" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s like that immediate sense making</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">while we are in process to know if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:36.980" style="s2">have bypassed something that that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:39.380" style="s2">actually wanted to agree upon in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.980" end="01:16:41.570" style="s2">movie in the moment how help us keep our</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.380" end="01:16:43.790" style="s2">agreements in the field help us know</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.570" end="01:16:46.940" style="s2">where we&#39;re at in regards to a process</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.790" end="01:16:49.310" style="s2">in any given moment and jump in from</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.940" end="01:16:51.830" style="s2">example from a facilitated fully</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.310" end="01:16:54.679" style="s2">facilitated group to uh oh now we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.830" end="01:16:58.850" style="s2">group facilitating or now we&#39;re popcorn</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.679" end="01:17:00.980" style="s2">doing popcorn oh now we need to to dive</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.850" end="01:17:03.440" style="s2">deeper into ourselves and connect</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.980" end="01:17:05.210" style="s2">vertically and we want to soar so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.440" end="01:17:06.830" style="s2">take a brief before breath before we</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.210" end="01:17:08.929" style="s2">speak and let&#39;s try to make the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.830" end="01:17:12.800" style="s2">conversations lower and then but then</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.929" end="01:17:15.750" style="s2">you can dynamically do that right so</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.800" end="01:17:18.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like in a way you could have</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.750" end="01:17:21.540" style="s2">you know boards that could that could</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.210" end="01:17:23.910" style="s2">show that that could indicate where the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.540" end="01:17:26.400" style="s2">collective is at in any given moment and</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.910" end="01:17:30.950" style="s2">individual words that could indicate</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.400" end="01:17:35.700" style="s2">where you are at in an individual moment</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.950" end="01:17:41.550" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s tricky because when we</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.700" end="01:17:45.830" style="s2">think about complex when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.550" end="01:17:45.830" style="s2">complex adaptive systems and the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.220" end="01:17:49.350" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.400" end="01:17:53.160" style="s2">merging changing flowing dynamics that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.350" end="01:17:55.140" style="s2">can occur right if we look at at bees</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.160" end="01:18:00.510" style="s2">and termites and ants and flocks and</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.140" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">schools like you mentioned earlier they</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.510" end="01:18:07.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have prefrontal cortices and in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:09.090" style="s2">the stigma jeddak dynamics that do hive</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.080" end="01:18:12.180" style="s2">intelligence that can be that adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.090" end="01:18:15.960" style="s2">all of the members of the hive are</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.180" end="01:18:20.520" style="s2">fungible to each other right they there</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.960" end="01:18:22.350" style="s2">is no uniqueness of activity or role</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.520" end="01:18:24.120" style="s2">based on the individual they all can do</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.350" end="01:18:25.830" style="s2">exactly the same thing so they which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.120" end="01:18:27.060" style="s2">why sting or G works as a signaling</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.830" end="01:18:29.910" style="s2">system because they&#39;ll all do the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.060" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">thing to the same signal it&#39;s also why</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.910" end="01:18:35.640" style="s2">they&#39;re fairly expendable as part of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:37.290" style="s2">strategy of the hive but it&#39;s also why</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.640" end="01:18:38.430" style="s2">they can count on each other to they can</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.290" end="01:18:41.100" style="s2">pretty much know what the one intern of</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.430" end="01:18:43.170" style="s2">them is going to do now when we come</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.100" end="01:18:44.610" style="s2">into a situation and people have very</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.170" end="01:18:46.290" style="s2">different learning styles and they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.610" end="01:18:48.300" style="s2">different skills and different</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.290" end="01:18:50.040" style="s2">attributes and so much so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.300" end="01:18:54.240" style="s2">into full kind of uniqueness of self</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.040" end="01:18:55.590" style="s2">then I can&#39;t assume that these six</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.240" end="01:18:58.620" style="s2">people are going to operate at all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.590" end="01:19:00.510" style="s2">same as the last six that I had which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.620" end="01:19:01.830" style="s2">why command and control hierarchy has</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.510" end="01:19:03.390" style="s2">worked to us is just all that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.830" end="01:19:04.770" style="s2">complexity let&#39;s make a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.390" end="01:19:06.510" style="s2">system that we can rule and let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.770" end="01:19:08.370" style="s2">people fungible let&#39;s make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.510" end="01:19:09.660" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s had an MBA can do these</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.370" end="01:19:11.940" style="s2">things and everyone who&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.660" end="01:19:14.220" style="s2">assembly line can do these things but of</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.940" end="01:19:16.800" style="s2">course that system is end-of-life right</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.220" end="01:19:18.210" style="s2">and and running out so one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.800" end="01:19:19.530" style="s2">I would say is that as we move in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.210" end="01:19:22.740" style="s2">systems where we have to have more</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.530" end="01:19:26.550" style="s2">complex and inner dynamical you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.740" end="01:19:27.610" style="s2">relationships okay we&#39;ve got to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.550" end="01:19:31.270" style="s2">listen so</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.610" end="01:19:34.989" style="s2">much better and that communicates so</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.270" end="01:19:38.739" style="s2">much better and to be able to actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.989" end="01:19:41.050" style="s2">adapt to different processes and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.739" end="01:19:44.920" style="s2">different people which requires real</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.050" end="01:19:47.110" style="s2">authentic full communication and so this</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.920" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">is where you&#39;re saying what is the what</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.110" end="01:19:52.150" style="s2">is the development at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:58.630" style="s2">individuals needed to make those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.150" end="01:20:02.020" style="s2">of processes effective Wow I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.630" end="01:20:04.119" style="s2">wrap because we&#39;ve been going on and of</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.020" end="01:20:06.699" style="s2">course we can keep going on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.119" end="01:20:09.610" style="s2">just so beautiful but I want a name into</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.699" end="01:20:14.020" style="s2">that last piece of just said on this</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.610" end="01:20:17.619" style="s2">make it really presence that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.020" end="01:20:21.100" style="s2">be listening better that we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.619" end="01:20:24.310" style="s2">then developing our sensing capacities</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.100" end="01:20:27.580" style="s2">and our sense source and our way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.310" end="01:20:30.400" style="s2">receive signals so that we can become</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.580" end="01:20:33.659" style="s2">better players over that we space of</p>
