<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">made worse when trying to remove it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:54.629" style="s2">because of the additional withdrawal</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">detox which we were only able to find in</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">Russia it was incredibly grueling and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">was further complicated by severe</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">hospitals he&#39;s had to spend four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">in the ICU in terrible shape but with</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">the help of some extremely competent and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">courageous doctors he survived the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">decision to bring him to Russia was made</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">in extreme desperation when we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">find any better option the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">around his recovery has been one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">most difficult and scary experiences</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever had so finally dad is on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">mend even though there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">physiological damage that he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">recover from he&#39;s improving and is off</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.810" style="s2">with the horrible medication his sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">of humor is back he&#39;s smiling again for</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.810" end="00:02:07.190" style="s2">the first time in months but he still</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">has a long way to go to recover fully</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.190" end="00:02:11.290" style="s2">it appears that we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">through this by the skin of our teeth</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.290" end="00:02:16.299" style="s2">so let me make a couple of things clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">now there are family nor the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.299" end="00:02:21.640" style="s2">here believe that this is a case of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">psychological addiction benzodiazepine</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.640" end="00:02:25.989" style="s2">physical dependence due to brain changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:27.670" style="s2">can occur in a matter of weeks it can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.989" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">made even worse by paradoxical reactions</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.670" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">that are difficult to diagnose and can</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:34.450" style="s2">be extremely dangerous we&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">and hoped that Dad will recover fully</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.450" end="00:02:39.940" style="s2">but it will take time and he still has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:43.269" style="s2">ways to go we&#39;re extremely lucky and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.940" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">grateful that he&#39;s alive the next update</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.269" end="00:02:48.569" style="s2">will come from him directly thanks again</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:48.569" style="s2">for all the support</p>
