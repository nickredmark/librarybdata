<p begin="00:00:05.270" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">so Daniel thank you for joining me I</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">know you&#39;ve been hugely busy over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.809" style="s2">last few days you&#39;re probably a familiar</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">face to many people on the channel and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.809" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">maybe people aren&#39;t aware that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">been deeply involved with the response</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">to this pandemic from the medical side</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">from the economic side liaison with</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">institutions and agencies and we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:32.009" style="s2">going to cover here like the situational</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">assessments where are we at right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.009" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">and what is the really crucial</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">information that people need to know and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:45.300" style="s2">act on right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">thank you David so we are recording on</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.300" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">March 21st I&#39;m saying that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">going to be giving a real-time</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">assessment and also recommendations and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">many of these recommendations will have</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">already happened and will be on to new</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">things and the assessment will have</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:07.460" style="s2">changed a few days from now so much of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">this information is rapidly changing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.460" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">also as a preface not a medical doctor</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:16.670" style="s2">so I&#39;m not giving medical advice here I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">am working with a number of groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.670" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">seeking to get good information and good</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">response across us so as a source of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">preface we&#39;ll start with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">situation assessment and then what a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">risk assessment of how the situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">could have full unfold based on unknowns</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:39.500" style="s2">and different response types would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">and then response recommendations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.500" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">then some brief notes on the background</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">situation that has brought us here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">what the kind of bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">responses need to be for systemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">fragility and catastrophic risk writ</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">large I&#39;ll start with just a quick note</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">on the nature of bias and assessing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">things like this because most everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:14.090" style="s2">has seen a range of responses from this</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">is no big deal it&#39;s just a flu</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.090" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">- this is the end of the world as we</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">know it and so obviously most of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:30.120" style="s2">responses are not particularly clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">informed but even amongst the clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.120" end="00:02:33.570" style="s2">informed things the curves can be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.490" style="s2">different based on how we respond and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.570" end="00:02:38.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of unknown still we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.490" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">know if getting the infection and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.460" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">recovering will confer immunity - where</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t get it again or if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">get it for across what range of changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">in mutation so given that there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">lot of unknowns including confounding</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">variables that could occur you do get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:00.270" style="s2">pretty wide range of estimates so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">gonna speak to in the risk assessment</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.270" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">some of the things that could go pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">badly if we don&#39;t respond well not</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">because that is definitely how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">going to go but because it could go that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">way if we don&#39;t respond preventatively</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">now this is a tricky thing anytime</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">someone is in the position of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.060" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">do an anticipatory response is that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">is the job in doing anticipatory risk</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">mitigation to assess the scenarios we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:27.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have happen to propose</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:30.209" style="s2">remedies to prevent them from happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.930" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">then people who have status quo bias</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.209" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">afterwards will say see it was overblown</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">hype those things didn&#39;t happen but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">only didn&#39;t happen because we made the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">responses so the the scenarios I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:46.380" style="s2">suggest hopefully don&#39;t happen but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">could and in order to not happen they</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.380" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">need us to take them seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:51.720" style="s2">respond in a way that prevents them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:53.820" style="s2">then after the fact we&#39;ll say see look</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.720" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">they didn&#39;t happen because we responded</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.820" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">well so this is a really key aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:01.410" style="s2">bias that&#39;s important now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:03.330" style="s2">situation where we have to act without</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.410" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">complete knowledge the time that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.330" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2">takes to get complete knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.160" end="00:04:09.570" style="s2">underlying situation is changing so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:11.640" style="s2">inaction is also a kind of action right</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.570" end="00:04:14.180" style="s2">there is a consequence to action and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.640" end="00:04:17.709" style="s2">inaction and the action is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.180" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2">inconsequential no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.709" end="00:04:23.380" style="s2">doing nationwide quarantines has an a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">massive effect on people&#39;s mental health</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.380" end="00:04:28.930" style="s2">on the underlying economy on lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">things and not doing it has a massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">effect and so we&#39;re not taking any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:36.130" style="s2">that trivially trivially what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:38.530" style="s2">gonna do is given what the unknowns are</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.130" end="00:04:41.500" style="s2">and what the knowns are what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.530" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">various scenarios factoring the second</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.500" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">and third and fourth order effects how</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">bad do they get and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">responsible approaches to take that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">maintain optionality for us to continue</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.350" style="s2">to make better responses as we get</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:56.979" style="s2">better information and as we get better</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.350" end="00:05:02.139" style="s2">capabilities that&#39;s it for the preface</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.979" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">so diving into situational assessment I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.139" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">think many people have a clearer sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">of the real risk here than they had even</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">a couple days ago because the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.810" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">of the actual risk portended is getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:24.910" style="s2">clearer in terms of obviously the US</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:26.979" style="s2">government and the UK government</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.910" end="00:05:29.860" style="s2">starting to change their position the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.979" end="00:05:32.260" style="s2">paper that came out from the Imperial</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.860" end="00:05:35.470" style="s2">College affected the positions of both</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.260" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">of those countries from let&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.470" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">of let everybody get it herd immunity</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.580" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">type approaches to oath that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:42.610" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be catastrophic and won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:46.690" style="s2">work and we have to be serious about</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.610" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">social distancing and quarantine there</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.690" end="00:05:53.590" style="s2">are still a lot of people who think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:56.229" style="s2">the risk of quarantine is worse than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.590" end="00:05:59.139" style="s2">risk of not and that the viral risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.229" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">itself is overblown and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.139" end="00:06:07.080" style="s2">the things that I want to address so</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:10.750" style="s2">we&#39;ll start right there so comparing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.080" end="00:06:12.130" style="s2">death rates to the flu and seeing that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.750" end="00:06:13.630" style="s2">lot less people have died and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.130" end="00:06:16.419" style="s2">thinking that it&#39;s overblown and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.630" end="00:06:18.789" style="s2">some kind of either state agenda to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.419" end="00:06:21.789" style="s2">concentrate control or mass hysteria or</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.789" end="00:06:24.740" style="s2">something like that a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.789" end="00:06:26.660" style="s2">that die from the flu every year</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.740" end="00:06:28.520" style="s2">is one it&#39;s a baseline that we always</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">have so looking at elevation from</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.520" end="00:06:32.990" style="s2">baseline is a critical factor because</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:36.830" style="s2">that&#39;s changing a the way that society</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">functions - because it&#39;s a baseline</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.830" end="00:06:40.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve had every year we have ICU</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:42.440" style="s2">capability for that we don&#39;t have ICU</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.550" end="00:06:43.370" style="s2">capability for spikes above that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.440" end="00:06:45.020" style="s2">that&#39;s where we start getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.370" end="00:06:48.729" style="s2">catastrophic collapse of the medical</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.020" end="00:06:52.780" style="s2">system that leads to much worse problems</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.729" end="00:06:55.009" style="s2">3 during a flu season most people get it</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.780" end="00:06:57.229" style="s2">very high percentage people get it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.009" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">because we don&#39;t try to stop the spread</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.229" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">because it&#39;s not that fatal not not that</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.620" end="00:08:46.120" style="s2">now to the flu is like a whole bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.430" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">critical because of the much larger</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.190" style="s2">very profound and they have to factor</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:45.769" style="s2">them all three of those numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.190" end="00:09:48.519" style="s2">variables they are not fixed just by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.769" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">nature of the virus themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.519" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">they&#39;re very affected by the social</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:57.370" style="s2">response social and institutional</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:10:00.199" style="s2">response so regarding the are not number</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.370" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">when we say the are not is two or</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.199" end="00:10:05.089" style="s2">two-and-a-half or whatever it is this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">a statistical average first it&#39;s a guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.089" end="00:10:08.600" style="s2">based on not knowing the actual number</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.220" style="s2">of infected cases because we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.600" end="00:10:14.060" style="s2">testing enough to know the actual number</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:15.709" style="s2">of infected cases and it&#39;s an average</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.060" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">across people who stay at home and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.709" end="00:10:19.640" style="s2">interact with anyone and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:22.279" style="s2">writing the subway and interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.640" end="00:10:24.740" style="s2">everyone and are in a lot of contact and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.279" end="00:10:27.079" style="s2">would be what we call super spreaders so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.740" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2">someone might infect a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.079" end="00:10:32.920" style="s2">and someone else might infect no people</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">right so averages are very misleading</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.920" end="00:10:38.690" style="s2">because someone can say okay two and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.459" style="s2">half people for me but particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.690" end="00:10:43.010" style="s2">young healthy people who don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.459" end="00:10:44.630" style="s2">they&#39;re at risk of dying and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.010" end="00:10:46.550" style="s2">like I can take a risk of getting this</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.630" end="00:10:47.830" style="s2">more than I can fake the risk of missing</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.550" end="00:10:50.500" style="s2">making money or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.830" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">is might continue to and especially if</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.500" end="00:10:55.630" style="s2">they stay because of being relatively</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:57.399" style="s2">healthy low symptom for a very long</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.399" end="00:11:04.360" style="s2">they could be super spreaders to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:05.860" style="s2">of people so it&#39;s important oh the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:09.220" style="s2">thing with regard to or not that we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.860" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">to understand is it&#39;s so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.220" end="00:11:13.149" style="s2">that&#39;s averaged and some people will</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:15.190" style="s2">spread much more than others but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.149" end="00:11:18.339" style="s2">this topic of portal pathways being able</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.190" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">to spread it to a critically sensitive</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:27.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just like how many</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.790" end="00:11:32.050" style="s2">spread it somewhere that actually is a</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.860" end="00:11:45.250" style="s2">facilities the death rate is also</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.250" end="00:11:51.579" style="s2">all won&#39;t die versus that have very high</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">mortality rates so the mortality rate</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:11:59.260" style="s2">are both older and have comorbidities is</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.079" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily hard to prevent it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.149" end="00:12:48.339" style="s2">from spreading and when we already don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:50.860" style="s2">have enough intubation equipment and ICU</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.339" end="00:12:54.730" style="s2">capabilities those aren&#39;t the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">places it&#39;s going to go so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.730" end="00:12:59.410" style="s2">factor not just super spreaders but</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:01.570" style="s2">portal pathways research patient 31 in</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.410" end="00:13:03.250" style="s2">South Korea South Korea basically had</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.820" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">occurred from that one person so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.009" end="00:13:18.569" style="s2">this is a place where we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:21.069" style="s2">factoring ourselves we&#39;re factoring the</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.680" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">died it&#39;s a massive variable so we see</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.630" end="00:13:44.860" style="s2">that the death rate the fatality rate</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:49.209" style="s2">and none of these numbers are perfect</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.860" end="00:13:51.759" style="s2">because this is total cases in ratio to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.209" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">the death cases but we don&#39;t have total</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.759" end="00:13:55.870" style="s2">cases right anywhere because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:58.180" style="s2">doing enough testing anywhere and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.870" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">countries aren&#39;t doing similar types and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.180" end="00:14:04.209" style="s2">amounts of testing so the statistics are</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">getting misleading but it looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.209" end="00:14:07.870" style="s2">best numbers or say in South Korea and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">the worst numbers or say in Iran or</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.870" end="00:14:13.089" style="s2">Italy in terms of fatality so South</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.130" style="s2">Korea&#39;s got like a point five percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.089" end="00:14:17.620" style="s2">fatality of the total number of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.130" end="00:14:19.209" style="s2">to get it less than half a percent or</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.620" end="00:14:21.550" style="s2">around a half a percent maybe up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.209" end="00:14:24.370" style="s2">about a percent die whereas you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.550" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">have like five six seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.370" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">depending upon how we factor the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">statistics dying in some other places</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.970" end="00:14:35.410" style="s2">partly this is going to have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.910" end="00:14:37.180" style="s2">the susceptibility of the communities</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.410" end="00:14:38.860" style="s2">that are getting hit obviously Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.180" end="00:14:41.800" style="s2">had a very high case fatality rate</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.860" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">because it had senior from a senior home</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.800" end="00:14:46.300" style="s2">to begin with right so that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:49.899" style="s2">start high but it&#39;s also very much the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.300" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">result of the response so if you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.899" end="00:14:54.189" style="s2">early Diagnostics not only can you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:56.470" style="s2">smart containment and prevent the spread</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.189" end="00:14:58.899" style="s2">you can start early treatment and early</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:15:02.769" style="s2">treatment means that the chance of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.899" end="00:15:06.370" style="s2">severe infection is going to go down</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.769" end="00:15:08.500" style="s2">radically so this is a novel virus</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.370" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s not a previous human virus</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.500" end="00:15:13.660" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t have innate immunity to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">it and we don&#39;t already have developed</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.660" end="00:15:17.759" style="s2">either vaccines or drug treat</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.529" style="s2">but we&#39;re obviously the whole world is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.759" end="00:15:22.949" style="s2">mobilizing on its learning curve as fast</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.529" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">as possible so it was found out that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.949" end="00:15:27.209" style="s2">chloroquine seems effective</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.470" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine seems more effective</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.209" end="00:15:30.360" style="s2">with less side effects the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.470" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine is a thorough myosin</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.360" end="00:15:34.799" style="s2">combo is looking quite effective but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:36.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not inconsequential there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.799" end="00:15:41.129" style="s2">retinopathy effects there&#39;s heart</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.540" end="00:15:42.749" style="s2">effects so there&#39;s also limited supply</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.129" end="00:15:44.670" style="s2">of hydroxychloroquine there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.749" end="00:15:46.379" style="s2">people who depend upon that med to live</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.670" end="00:15:48.809" style="s2">who have lupus who are having a hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.379" end="00:15:50.699" style="s2">time getting in which then starts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.809" end="00:15:55.139" style="s2">cause death from other reasons right or</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.699" end="00:15:58.589" style="s2">um not just death but hospitalization</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.139" end="00:16:00.299" style="s2">and health issues and whatever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.589" end="00:16:01.589" style="s2">research being done on lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.299" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">antivirals that are looking promising</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.589" end="00:16:07.619" style="s2">and on cytokine inhibitors and on ACE -</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:10.230" style="s2">modulators on plasma antibody transfers</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.619" end="00:16:11.699" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think the world has ever had</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.230" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">a situation where we medically learned</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.699" end="00:16:17.249" style="s2">as fast as is happening now this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:19.439" style="s2">another reason to want to slow the curve</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.249" end="00:16:22.019" style="s2">radically because we are much less well</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.439" end="00:16:24.989" style="s2">prepared today than we will be each day</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.019" end="00:16:28.319" style="s2">that passes for dealing with us as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.989" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">learning more but already a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.319" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2">doctors are treating with</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.389" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine and as a thorough</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.860" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">myosin and other things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.389" end="00:16:36.749" style="s2">even just getting on fluids and but</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:39.089" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you get a treat with</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.749" end="00:16:40.860" style="s2">those drugs early on most of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.089" end="00:16:42.389" style="s2">people won&#39;t have to go to the ICU even</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.860" end="00:16:46.769" style="s2">the same people that would have had to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.389" end="00:16:48.329" style="s2">go to the ICU otherwise and many of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.769" end="00:16:50.279" style="s2">people that will have to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.329" end="00:16:53.850" style="s2">hospital won&#39;t need intubated and won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.279" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">die and so early diagnostics and early</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:16:58.610" style="s2">treatment also change the curve of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:01.529" style="s2">illness for people who do get infected</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.610" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">also early diagnostics changes the curve</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.529" end="00:17:07.769" style="s2">of how many other people they in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.029" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">right so you can have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.769" end="00:17:13.350" style="s2">a very high percentage of the total</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:16.380" style="s2">population who gets infected will end up</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.350" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">having to go to the ICU right like 20%</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.380" end="00:17:19.799" style="s2">of the population you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:22.439" style="s2">situation where almost nobody has to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.799" end="00:17:23.819" style="s2">to the ICU because we&#39;re testing of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.439" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">aquit ously and getting good treatments</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.819" end="00:17:27.659" style="s2">to people so it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:29.420" style="s2">understand how variable that is and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.659" end="00:17:33.059" style="s2">same with death rates</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.420" end="00:17:34.679" style="s2">it is not true that this is only a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.059" end="00:17:38.010" style="s2">serious illness for old people with</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.679" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">comorbidities it is mostly only fatal</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.010" end="00:17:44.280" style="s2">for people who are older or have</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:46.110" style="s2">comorbidities so far but half of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.280" end="00:17:48.600" style="s2">people in Italy who are on intubation</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.110" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">which means a tube in your lungs keeping</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.600" end="00:17:54.900" style="s2">you alive are under 60 half of them are</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">and if they didn&#39;t have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:17:59.250" style="s2">equipment then they wouldn&#39;t stay alive</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">many of them and so it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.250" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">understand that part of why the fatality</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.190" style="s2">rates are lower is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">depending upon life support systems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.190" end="00:18:08.340" style="s2">if those life support systems went out</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">the fatality would go way up</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.340" end="00:18:11.750" style="s2">now Italy&#39;s already gone to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:13.980" style="s2">situation where they don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.750" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">respirators and ICU capability for</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.980" end="00:18:17.550" style="s2">everyone so there triaging and so some</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.740" style="s2">people are just being led to die because</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.550" end="00:18:21.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t have any other options so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.740" end="00:18:23.309" style="s2">then the death percentage goes way up</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.630" end="00:18:24.510" style="s2">right that&#39;s the single biggest thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.309" end="00:18:26.100" style="s2">that affects the percentage of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.510" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">that die is the overwhelm of ICU</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.100" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">capabilities and then people can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">treated for coronavirus and so they die</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.970" end="00:18:38.520" style="s2">also you can have a situation where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:39.900" style="s2">hospital is overwhelmed so people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.520" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">get treated for the normal stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.900" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">we save people&#39;s lives from heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">attacks and strokes and ambulances are</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:46.500" style="s2">taking a long time to get to places and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">bleeding looms and all those other</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.500" end="00:18:55.950" style="s2">things so it&#39;s important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:18:57.630" style="s2">that all of those numbers regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.950" end="00:18:58.950" style="s2">spread of the infection the number of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.630" end="00:19:00.690" style="s2">people to get hospitalized the number of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.950" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">people that die are all variable we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.690" end="00:19:03.240" style="s2">change all of them and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">recommendations we&#39;re going to share or</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.240" end="00:19:07.290" style="s2">how to make those numbers lower but</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:09.030" style="s2">those numbers can all go radically high</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.290" end="00:19:10.410" style="s2">if we don&#39;t respond appropriately we</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.030" end="00:19:12.540" style="s2">could have a spread all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.410" end="00:19:14.850" style="s2">saturation we could overwhelm the ICU</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.540" end="00:19:16.800" style="s2">Ziff where we will if that happens the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.850" end="00:19:18.900" style="s2">death rate goes very high that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.800" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">mention yet what the follow-on effects</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.900" end="00:19:23.340" style="s2">on the infrastructure and national</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:26.190" style="s2">security and the economy and other</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.340" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">things will be but just even factoring</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.190" end="00:19:36.030" style="s2">that so now should we get into secondary</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">effects sure yep so this much has not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.030" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">been clear to everyone it&#39;s still not</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:40.039" style="s2">clear to everyone but it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.760" end="00:19:42.289" style="s2">get clearer</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.039" end="00:19:43.460" style="s2">and you had someone on the other day</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.289" end="00:19:46.279" style="s2">who&#39;s written some really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.460" end="00:19:50.269" style="s2">articles on these things PO a said his</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.279" end="00:19:54.679" style="s2">name Thomas boy oh yes oh yeah yeah read</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.269" end="00:19:56.389" style="s2">his articles they&#39;re very good and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.679" end="00:19:59.119" style="s2">know that kind of information is</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.389" end="00:20:01.190" style="s2">starting to get clearer the next step we</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.119" end="00:20:03.649" style="s2">have to look at is let&#39;s say that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.190" end="00:20:06.009" style="s2">look at the health effects on people as</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.649" end="00:20:11.659" style="s2">first order effects these are the virus</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.009" end="00:20:12.710" style="s2">direct action first actually before I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.659" end="00:20:16.099" style="s2">get to second-order effects let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.710" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">address some of the unknowns here we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.099" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">immunity be conferred don&#39;t know and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:26.210" style="s2">as far as herd immunity type questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">we do not know enough to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.210" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">those assessments yet because and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:37.309" style="s2">again this is as of March 21st a few</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:40.009" style="s2">days from now we might know more there</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.309" end="00:20:43.340" style="s2">are cases injured in China and Japan of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.009" end="00:20:45.759" style="s2">people who were diagnosed with kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.340" end="00:20:48.739" style="s2">who got better and then who got it again</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.759" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">did they for sure get all the way better</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.739" end="00:20:53.509" style="s2">and then got reinfected exhaustion ously</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.009" style="s2">or did they not get rid of the virus all</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.509" end="00:20:57.169" style="s2">the way and then it recirculated in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.009" end="00:20:59.419" style="s2">their system or was the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.169" end="00:21:01.340" style="s2">exposure some other thing like a normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.419" end="00:21:05.960" style="s2">flu or whatever we don&#39;t know yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.340" end="00:21:10.519" style="s2">not clear enough also there are antibody</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.960" end="00:21:12.529" style="s2">responses for the people who are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.519" end="00:21:14.809" style="s2">sick and then getting better but what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.529" end="00:21:17.269" style="s2">that antibody response actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.809" end="00:21:20.509" style="s2">do what is it priming we also just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.269" end="00:21:22.519" style="s2">know yet so it&#39;s could it is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.509" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">antibody response such that next time</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.519" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">someone is exposed to the virus even in</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:27.529" style="s2">high viral load they&#39;ll get no symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:29.269" style="s2">at all their body will fight it off so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.529" end="00:21:31.580" style="s2">quickly they get no symptoms maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.269" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll be awesome do they get symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:35.090" style="s2">but less severely because their body</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:37.070" style="s2">fights it quicker or do they actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.090" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">get a worse case because people actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.070" end="00:21:40.879" style="s2">die from the immune response right they</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:42.799" style="s2">die from a cytokine storm from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.879" end="00:21:45.729" style="s2">inflammatory response that happens it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.799" end="00:21:49.549" style="s2">ends up overwhelming the lungs and other</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.729" end="00:21:51.289" style="s2">other organs so interleukin 6 primarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.549" end="00:21:53.400" style="s2">in TNF alpha there&#39;s drugs that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.289" end="00:21:55.380" style="s2">working to block those but could</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.400" end="00:21:57.210" style="s2">that the antibody response Prime&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.380" end="00:21:58.680" style="s2">cytokine storm that&#39;s been speculated</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.210" end="00:21:59.730" style="s2">just don&#39;t know yet because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.680" end="00:22:01.410" style="s2">have a lot of people who&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.730" end="00:22:03.240" style="s2">better and we know they got better we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.410" end="00:22:07.170" style="s2">tested that there&#39;s zero viral load and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.240" end="00:22:09.810" style="s2">then they reexpose then let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.170" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">someone does have immunity will everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.810" end="00:22:13.950" style="s2">have the same immunity or will it be</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">that people who have more compromised</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.950" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">immune systems or primed for cytokine</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:19.860" style="s2">storm and other people are primed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:20.850" style="s2">actually have good responses there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.860" end="00:22:22.650" style="s2">probably going to be a Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.850" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">distribution of the type of response</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.650" end="00:22:28.380" style="s2">that occurs or there could very well be</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.180" style="s2">right the next question is how long will</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.380" end="00:22:31.350" style="s2">the immunity last will it last for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.180" end="00:22:34.020" style="s2">couple years which would be really</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.350" end="00:22:36.360" style="s2">helpful as it didn&#39;t SARS or is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.020" end="00:22:38.070" style="s2">mutation such that the antibodies last</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.360" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">only for a couple months in which case</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.070" end="00:22:43.830" style="s2">this thing keeps circulating we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.880" end="00:22:46.290" style="s2">know again we don&#39;t have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.830" end="00:22:50.520" style="s2">long-term data the other thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.290" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">the virus is mutating and how wide of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.520" end="00:22:54.750" style="s2">mutation will the antibodies protect</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">against even if they are protective is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.750" end="00:22:58.470" style="s2">question right so as we know with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.270" style="s2">Spanish flu situation it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.470" end="00:23:01.400" style="s2">first round that killed the most people</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.270" end="00:23:05.270" style="s2">it was the second round</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.400" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s even say we got hurt immunity</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.270" end="00:23:11.490" style="s2">we know that we don&#39;t get hurt immunity</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:13.350" style="s2">against the flu permanently it every</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.490" end="00:23:14.610" style="s2">year kills a bunch more people right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.350" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">we know that even if we vaccinate</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:18.570" style="s2">against that the vaccine is not good</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:20.730" style="s2">against the mutation so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.570" end="00:23:22.530" style="s2">similar situation here let&#39;s say that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.730" end="00:23:24.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t control this adequately and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.530" end="00:23:26.940" style="s2">with us every year like the flu now but</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.180" end="00:23:28.350" style="s2">on top of the flu but with a much higher</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.940" end="00:23:32.430" style="s2">fatality and it reaches saturation</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.350" end="00:23:35.940" style="s2">numbers then we could look at this being</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.430" end="00:23:39.590" style="s2">a meaningfully population decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.940" end="00:23:42.090" style="s2">phenomena so let&#39;s say you get to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.590" end="00:23:45.030" style="s2">saturation 70% of the people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.090" end="00:23:46.950" style="s2">infected and 2% of them die or because</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.030" end="00:23:50.670" style="s2">70% are infected and it overwhelms the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.950" end="00:23:53.010" style="s2">IC use 5% of the people die calculate</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.670" end="00:23:55.110" style="s2">those on country-by-country basis or</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.010" end="00:23:59.340" style="s2">global basis those are tremendously huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.110" end="00:24:01.290" style="s2">numbers right so that&#39;s a there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.340" end="00:24:03.330" style="s2">numbers like 1 million there&#39;s numbers</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.290" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">like 10 million in the US based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.330" end="00:24:06.220" style="s2">exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:09.280" style="s2">what the death rates are and how those</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.220" end="00:24:10.870" style="s2">curves happen but there I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.280" end="00:24:13.150" style="s2">number of soldiers that died in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.870" end="00:24:15.850" style="s2">over 11 years was 50,000 or something</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.150" end="00:24:20.860" style="s2">like that so you can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.850" end="00:24:23.320" style="s2">multiples we&#39;re looking at so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.860" end="00:24:25.929" style="s2">yet know about whether immunity will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.320" end="00:24:27.910" style="s2">adequately conferred we don&#39;t yet know</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.929" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">about the rate and the severity of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.910" end="00:24:36.549" style="s2">mutations and if the following mutations</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:38.740" style="s2">will be more or less lethal we don&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.549" end="00:24:42.299" style="s2">know what the long-term health effects</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.740" end="00:24:45.100" style="s2">of contracting this are so we know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.299" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">viruses don&#39;t just go away permanently</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.100" end="00:24:50.169" style="s2">in many cases they go into chronic</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:51.970" style="s2">phases so someone gets her Peas and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.169" end="00:24:54.010" style="s2">can continue to get herpes right they</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.970" end="00:24:56.380" style="s2">get HPV warts and they can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.010" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">get words and they can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.380" end="00:25:02.740" style="s2">become infectious when that happens we</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">know that with other infections you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">chickenpox you don&#39;t get again for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.210" end="00:25:09.910" style="s2">long time but then you get shingles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:11.860" style="s2">then for some things like say mono then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.910" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">you still have low-grade epstein-barr</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.860" end="00:25:16.090" style="s2">that can increase likelihoods for</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:20.200" style="s2">cancers and chronic fatigue syndrome and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.090" end="00:25:22.419" style="s2">things like that so what are is is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.200" end="00:25:24.250" style="s2">going to be a chronic health implication</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.419" end="00:25:25.990" style="s2">of this in addition to the existing</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.250" end="00:25:27.610" style="s2">chronic viruses that are already part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.990" end="00:25:31.990" style="s2">the health care system this is again</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.610" end="00:25:36.040" style="s2">also a totally not known topic and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.990" end="00:25:40.600" style="s2">the people who get a serious illness but</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.040" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">don&#39;t die the CT scans of their lungs</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.600" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">show very serious damage to their lungs</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">some of them are showing damage to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:50.280" style="s2">heart cardiomyopathy and other body</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:53.140" style="s2">systems so might there be lasting damage</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.280" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">it affects the duration of that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.140" end="00:26:00.040" style="s2">life even for people who and I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:03.730" style="s2">via the viral or immunological process</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.040" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">but the tissue damage processes well we</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.730" end="00:26:09.179" style="s2">know that tissue damage is occurring of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:11.169" style="s2">the type that normally is lasting</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.179" end="00:26:12.760" style="s2">obviously what that looks like two or</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.169" end="00:26:16.210" style="s2">three years later we don&#39;t yet know but</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.760" end="00:26:18.070" style="s2">that should all tell people that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.210" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">not something to take lightly</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.070" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a good bit of unknown</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">also just look at a video of someone on</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:28.660" style="s2">intubation and who&#39;s got to be intubated</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:30.910" style="s2">for weeks like that&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.660" end="00:26:34.570" style="s2">undesirable thing to experience even if</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.910" end="00:26:35.890" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t kill you and again back that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.570" end="00:26:39.610" style="s2">half of the people in Italy on</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.890" end="00:26:40.810" style="s2">intubation are under 60 so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.610" end="00:26:44.590" style="s2">little bit more just on the medical</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.810" end="00:26:46.900" style="s2">effects right okay so let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.590" end="00:26:50.130" style="s2">that is all looking at kind of just the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.900" end="00:26:52.600" style="s2">direct virus acting on human physiology</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.130" end="00:26:54.670" style="s2">so now we look at second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.600" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">and we say okay so what is the effect on</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.670" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">the medical system from spikes well</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:04.930" style="s2">beyond the capacity of what I see use</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:06.670" style="s2">our setup for so it&#39;s expensive to run</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.930" end="00:27:08.710" style="s2">hospitals it&#39;s expensive to run</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.670" end="00:27:10.090" style="s2">intensive care units and to train lots</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.710" end="00:27:12.840" style="s2">of doctors and whatever to just be</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.090" end="00:27:15.670" style="s2">sitting around waiting for surges so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.840" end="00:27:18.160" style="s2">hospitals and I see use run pretty close</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.670" end="00:27:21.460" style="s2">to full capacity for financial</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:22.990" style="s2">efficiency which means that really big</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.460" end="00:27:25.630" style="s2">surges are things that are not well</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.990" end="00:27:27.910" style="s2">prepared for some things can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.630" end="00:27:30.310" style="s2">upregulated fairly quickly some things</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.910" end="00:27:32.620" style="s2">can&#39;t like it&#39;s not very easy to build a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.310" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">lot more respirators in a hurry or to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.620" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">train a lot more doctors in a hurry so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:41.770" style="s2">if the number of people who are going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:44.770" style="s2">I see use is within the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.770" end="00:27:46.990" style="s2">the ICU can scale up to the death</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.770" end="00:27:48.940" style="s2">percentages will stay relatively low if</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.990" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">it exceeds it and the I see us to start</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.940" end="00:27:52.660" style="s2">triaging who gets treated and who</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:54.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t the number of deaths the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.660" end="00:27:58.150" style="s2">percentage of deaths is going to go way</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:28:00.280" style="s2">up so let&#39;s say that the number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.150" end="00:28:02.140" style="s2">people that are going in is 2x what the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.280" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">ICU czar prepared for and they can get</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.140" end="00:28:06.820" style="s2">people in the hallways and whatever okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:09.880" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing but what if it&#39;s 10x or</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.820" end="00:28:13.570" style="s2">more this is where you start seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.880" end="00:28:15.400" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing in Italy and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.570" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">worse where it&#39;s just people just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.400" end="00:28:20.980" style="s2">be treated now besides the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:23.050" style="s2">most of the hospitals in the US are</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:24.730" style="s2">already running low on personal</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.050" end="00:28:26.560" style="s2">protective equipment or don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.730" end="00:28:28.180" style="s2">it and doctors are putting themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.560" end="00:28:29.690" style="s2">and nurses putting themselves a huge</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.180" end="00:28:31.700" style="s2">personal risk</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.690" end="00:28:33.470" style="s2">rate of doctors and nurses getting sick</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.700" end="00:28:35.390" style="s2">is estimated at something like two to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.470" end="00:28:36.470" style="s2">five x with the rate of everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.390" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">and they&#39;re the people who most</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.470" end="00:28:44.090" style="s2">critically can&#39;t get sick and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:45.950" style="s2">not enough ICU beds there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.090" end="00:28:48.860" style="s2">intubation equipment there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.950" end="00:28:54.140" style="s2">of the tests of the hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.860" end="00:28:55.880" style="s2">of whatever right very since doctor</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.140" end="00:28:57.740" style="s2">friend of mine in LA told me something</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.880" end="00:29:00.560" style="s2">like currently there&#39;s a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.740" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">fifty beds and ICU left in LA there&#39;s 10</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.560" end="00:29:05.060" style="s2">million people in LA and let&#39;s just look</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:10.280" style="s2">at what any percentage of saturation</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.060" end="00:29:11.990" style="s2">looks like and what any reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.280" end="00:29:13.880" style="s2">percentage of that having to go to ICU</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.990" end="00:29:19.850" style="s2">is and it&#39;s like oh that that can look</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.880" end="00:29:21.830" style="s2">terrible in a hurry ring so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.850" end="00:29:25.010" style="s2">if our doctors and nurses are getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.830" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">sick and we saw a couple thousand health</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.010" end="00:29:27.920" style="s2">care workers and China gets that grade</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:29.660" style="s2">and China did a good job of containing</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.920" end="00:29:31.430" style="s2">it to one area which we haven&#39;t we now</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.660" end="00:29:33.920" style="s2">have cases in all 50 states they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.430" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">able to mostly quarantine Hubei Province</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.920" end="00:29:41.030" style="s2">and Wuhan and have the spread outside</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.980" end="00:29:46.550" style="s2">much less but because of their drastic</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.030" end="00:29:48.890" style="s2">rapid intense response and also even if</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.550" end="00:29:50.420" style="s2">the doctors and nurses don&#39;t get sick</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.890" end="00:29:52.250" style="s2">just wearing them out because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.420" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">trying to save lives running so many</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.250" end="00:29:59.330" style="s2">shifts go look at the videos of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:30:00.770" style="s2">in ICU in Seattle in Italy and just kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.330" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">of get a sense of what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.770" end="00:30:07.280" style="s2">and read some of the letters that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:12.140" style="s2">doctors in Italy are writing that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.280" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">kind of sharing their experience so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.140" end="00:30:17.210" style="s2">start to have a collapse of the health</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:20.870" style="s2">care system and now this has all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.210" end="00:30:22.820" style="s2">of cascading consequences for death from</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.870" end="00:30:25.160" style="s2">all other kinds of things and chronic</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.820" end="00:30:30.950" style="s2">health implications and whatever alright</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.160" end="00:30:33.710" style="s2">next so let&#39;s say we try to institute a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:35.660" style="s2">quarantine and people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.710" end="00:30:36.950" style="s2">participate and so we have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.660" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">National Guard and the police we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.950" end="00:30:40.970" style="s2">allowed to try to initiate it if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.060" style="s2">look at the videos from South Korea and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.970" end="00:30:45.510" style="s2">China</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.060" end="00:30:48.630" style="s2">and Hong Kong you&#39;ll see that the police</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.510" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">and the National Guard equivalents are</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.630" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">all wearing hazmat gear and the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:54.510" style="s2">and the nurses and the people doing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:57.240" style="s2">sanitizing and picking up the trash are</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.510" end="00:30:58.740" style="s2">all in pretty intensive degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.240" end="00:31:00.510" style="s2">personal protective equipment and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.740" end="00:31:05.250" style="s2">very frontline high exposure ones are in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.510" end="00:31:07.590" style="s2">hazmat gear to the best of my knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.250" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">and pretty active communication about</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.590" end="00:31:11.910" style="s2">this neither the u.s. nor the UK have</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.250" style="s2">that much gear nor do they have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.910" end="00:31:15.870" style="s2">training to be able to get that to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.250" end="00:31:19.560" style="s2">frontline people that would need to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.870" end="00:31:21.060" style="s2">it so obviously we have to find where</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.560" end="00:31:22.680" style="s2">the surplus is get it to the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.060" end="00:31:26.010" style="s2">critical people in triage get the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.680" end="00:31:28.050" style="s2">training up and produce more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.010" end="00:31:29.520" style="s2">instantly because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.050" end="00:31:31.920" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice about many of those jobs</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.520" end="00:31:33.690" style="s2">is that they have very high contact with</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.920" end="00:31:36.150" style="s2">each other right police are riding in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.690" end="00:31:36.840" style="s2">truck together they&#39;re in a locker room</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.150" end="00:31:40.340" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.840" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">National Guard etc first responders and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:46.980" style="s2">because of the long asymptomatic period</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:48.600" style="s2">2 to 21 days asymptomatic and some cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.980" end="00:31:50.040" style="s2">actually recover while being quite low</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.600" end="00:31:52.500" style="s2">symptoms so you can be spreading that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.040" end="00:31:55.800" style="s2">entire time and we don&#39;t have you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.500" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">testing out so what happens if a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.800" end="00:31:59.280" style="s2">significant percentage of the police</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:01.590" style="s2">start to get sick or the National Guard</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.280" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">or military or prison guards or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.590" end="00:32:05.910" style="s2">people who run the utilities the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:08.370" style="s2">critical utilities or the supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.910" end="00:32:10.200" style="s2">you can start to get now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.370" end="00:32:13.590" style="s2">cascading kind of third order failures</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.200" end="00:32:19.740" style="s2">and these are much much worse risks than</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.590" end="00:32:22.740" style="s2">the virus right so obviously everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.740" end="00:32:24.150" style="s2">can&#39;t go on quarantine because for most</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.740" end="00:32:25.890" style="s2">people to be able to stay home the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.150" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">electricity has to stay on and the water</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.890" end="00:32:29.240" style="s2">has to stay on the internet has to stay</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:33.030" style="s2">on they have to have some way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.240" end="00:32:35.220" style="s2">either the supermarket&#39;s have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.030" end="00:32:36.840" style="s2">triage version of staying open or</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.220" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">delivery mechanisms happen the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.840" end="00:32:41.280" style="s2">pharmacies so there&#39;s a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:43.980" style="s2">whose jobs are required to basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.280" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">mediate societal function and not having</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.980" end="00:32:49.830" style="s2">societal collapse all of those people</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:52.050" style="s2">need to get personal protective</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.830" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">equipment and/or hazmat gear based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.050" end="00:32:54.590" style="s2">the degree of exposure they have and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:56.270" style="s2">they need</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.590" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">to get training for how to use it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.270" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">they need to have in Sherman of payments</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:07.580" style="s2">so they don&#39;t go on strike this is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:11.029" style="s2">the time we need or trash the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.580" end="00:33:13.159" style="s2">that do trash sanitization engineers</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.029" end="00:33:15.340" style="s2">getting sick or going on strike right</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.159" end="00:33:17.929" style="s2">we&#39;re then you start to get additional</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.340" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">health plague type issues associated</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.929" end="00:33:22.549" style="s2">trash piling up or any critical</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.549" end="00:33:29.419" style="s2">problems but that could happen right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.990" end="00:33:31.640" style="s2">we already see we saw in Italy certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.419" end="00:33:33.950" style="s2">prisons being overtaken by the prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.640" end="00:33:35.179" style="s2">because of this situation either because</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.950" end="00:33:36.740" style="s2">the prison guards didn&#39;t want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.179" end="00:33:38.510" style="s2">work or about sick or various things</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.740" end="00:33:40.309" style="s2">like that now the US has a much higher</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.309" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">prison than any other country the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.070" end="00:33:46.220" style="s2">prisons are going to be highly</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.390" end="00:33:49.070" style="s2">vulnerable to the spread if it happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.220" end="00:33:50.990" style="s2">inside of there and they know they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.070" end="00:33:52.580" style="s2">be the first people to get intubated so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.990" end="00:33:54.830" style="s2">what does that mean for the mindset of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.580" end="00:33:57.169" style="s2">you know people in there these are just</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.830" end="00:33:58.789" style="s2">these are serious follow-on effects that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.169" end="00:34:03.770" style="s2">really have to be thought about and in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.789" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">addressed anticipatorily now we also</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.770" end="00:34:07.190" style="s2">have confounding effects which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:10.220" style="s2">independent variables but that also</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.190" end="00:34:13.669" style="s2">affect the overall situation the floods</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.220" end="00:34:15.379" style="s2">are starting in the US and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.669" end="00:34:18.919" style="s2">normal thing we get floods in the rainy</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.379" end="00:34:21.290" style="s2">season but how do the droplets of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.919" end="00:34:23.720" style="s2">disease spread and water scenarios where</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.290" end="00:34:25.669" style="s2">everybody&#39;s walking around in ankle-deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.720" end="00:34:28.780" style="s2">or knee-deep water</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.669" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">how do you do containment and quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.780" end="00:34:33.230" style="s2">when you&#39;re having to move people</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:38.330" style="s2">because of floods how does that affect</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.230" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">the redirection of medical and first</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.330" end="00:34:41.690" style="s2">responders you know those types of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.339" style="s2">things right we also had a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.690" end="00:34:45.830" style="s2">earthquake in Utah that was just a wake</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.339" end="00:34:48.589" style="s2">up of like Oh the rest of the normal</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.830" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">disasters don&#39;t go on and hold so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.589" end="00:34:51.619" style="s2">know as we come in the summer and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:54.980" style="s2">think about what California&#39;s wildfire</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.619" end="00:34:56.659" style="s2">season was like last year and think</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.980" end="00:34:59.140" style="s2">about okay so what happens where you got</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.659" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">a quarantine then the wildfire start or</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.140" end="00:35:04.700" style="s2">Florida hurricane season or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:06.950" style="s2">right so we also have to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.700" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">rest of general preparedness</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.950" end="00:35:10.369" style="s2">in those issues and where we started to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:12.289" style="s2">get quarantined down and now we lose</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.369" end="00:35:15.609" style="s2">quarantine because of some other issue</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.289" end="00:35:18.650" style="s2">and or can&#39;t respond so we get worse</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.609" end="00:35:20.059" style="s2">death tolls or infrastructure collapse</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.650" end="00:35:21.559" style="s2">because our responders are already</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.059" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">purposed somewhere else for sick or</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.559" end="00:35:29.329" style="s2">taxed or something like that right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.599" style="s2">we start to look at the political</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.329" end="00:35:35.960" style="s2">effects could we have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.599" end="00:35:40.059" style="s2">the countries on quarantine during the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.960" end="00:35:42.619" style="s2">elections for the US yeah do we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.059" end="00:35:43.819" style="s2">digital voting that is secure and ready</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.619" end="00:35:46.369" style="s2">to go where people can vote from at home</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.819" end="00:35:47.269" style="s2">no not currently and what it would take</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.369" end="00:35:49.309" style="s2">to get there</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.269" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">we have no precedent for we also have no</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.309" end="00:35:57.019" style="s2">precedent for a plague you know a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:59.900" style="s2">pandemic during voting if we get if to</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.019" end="00:36:01.880" style="s2">ensure that people go and vote do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.900" end="00:36:03.769" style="s2">increase the pandemic spread and have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.880" end="00:36:05.539" style="s2">spike during that time and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.769" end="00:36:08.750" style="s2">have a whole additional spike to deal</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.539" end="00:36:11.329" style="s2">with does this change the demographics</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.750" end="00:36:13.309" style="s2">of who&#39;s available to go significantly</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.329" end="00:36:19.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole big serious set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.309" end="00:36:21.529" style="s2">questions there obviously the economic</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.880" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">situation we&#39;ve seen trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.529" end="00:36:28.220" style="s2">dollars of loss since this is started in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:30.819" style="s2">the stock market and if you take for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.220" end="00:36:35.420" style="s2">US or the UK or any country or the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.819" end="00:36:37.039" style="s2">you take the GDP per month and you say</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.420" end="00:36:40.059" style="s2">okay under quarantine people are staying</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.039" end="00:36:42.319" style="s2">home we&#39;re not just looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.059" end="00:36:43.819" style="s2">effective asset classes because of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.319" end="00:36:48.009" style="s2">trading and fear and whatever and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.819" end="00:36:48.009" style="s2">not just looking at the effect of on</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.819" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">Airlines and a few industries but all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.809" end="00:36:59.869" style="s2">the restaurants and all of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.500" end="00:37:01.609" style="s2">sporting and cruises and in-person type</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.869" end="00:37:04.369" style="s2">things small businesses everything under</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.609" end="00:37:06.410" style="s2">quarantine so we&#39;re looking at not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.369" end="00:37:08.180" style="s2">a effect on the financial sector but on</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.410" end="00:37:10.549" style="s2">the actual real economics of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.180" end="00:37:12.799" style="s2">productivity itself and supply and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.549" end="00:37:15.890" style="s2">demand type dynamics themselves so then</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.799" end="00:37:18.200" style="s2">we get what a decrease of by 30 percent</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.890" end="00:37:19.400" style="s2">under quarantine or forty percent or</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.200" end="00:37:22.099" style="s2">whatever of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:24.349" style="s2">world GDP capacity so look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.099" end="00:37:27.410" style="s2">GDP of the US for instance per Montes</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.349" end="00:37:29.240" style="s2">look at losing 30 or 40 percent of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.410" end="00:37:31.160" style="s2">per month and the idea that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.240" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">has to be subsidized just for break-even</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.160" end="00:37:36.049" style="s2">type effects not mentioning the up</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:38.180" style="s2">ramping I see use capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.049" end="00:37:41.180" style="s2">diagnostic capabilities and things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.180" end="00:37:43.609" style="s2">that or international aid which brings</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.180" end="00:37:45.140" style="s2">us to the next topic there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.609" end="00:37:47.480" style="s2">in economics by the way seventy percent</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.140" end="00:37:49.279" style="s2">of Americans live paycheck to paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.480" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">and can&#39;t afford to be quarantined for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.279" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">while so they will push to want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:55.609" style="s2">working and you know spread infection</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:57.289" style="s2">for them to be able to stay home is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.609" end="00:37:58.789" style="s2">gonna require economic support in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.289" end="00:38:00.380" style="s2">stimulus packages which are already in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.789" end="00:38:03.589" style="s2">discussion which is really good which</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.380" end="00:38:07.700" style="s2">should be suspension of rent and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.589" end="00:38:09.289" style="s2">mortgage payments and either a ubi or</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.700" end="00:38:13.670" style="s2">some kind of food and medicine</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.289" end="00:38:15.140" style="s2">provisioning type capabilities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.670" end="00:38:16.700" style="s2">going to need to be protection for small</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.140" end="00:38:19.369" style="s2">businesses so there doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.700" end="00:38:21.289" style="s2">massive laying off of people because if</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.369" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">you have bankruptcy and collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.289" end="00:38:24.619" style="s2">small businesses they can&#39;t rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:25.880" style="s2">themselves that quickly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.619" end="00:38:27.859" style="s2">learning group to be able to rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.880" end="00:38:29.180" style="s2">things so it&#39;s like you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.859" end="00:38:34.339" style="s2">clear cut a forest you don&#39;t get a new</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.180" end="00:38:37.700" style="s2">forest back right away and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.339" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">lot in the economic space that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.700" end="00:38:44.289" style="s2">addressed the geopolitical space is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.910" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">actually where my biggest concerns are</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.289" end="00:38:50.299" style="s2">so I&#39;ll share a scenario it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:53.390" style="s2">only scenario so we see already Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.299" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">Arabia doing and Russia in this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.390" end="00:38:58.250" style="s2">oil price gouging kind of scenario and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">that could play out all kinds of weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.250" end="00:39:00.849" style="s2">ways so there&#39;s lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.650" style="s2">scenarios that could occur but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.849" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">specifically focus on us-china relations</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.650" end="00:39:11.270" style="s2">and overall geopolitical placement first</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:13.279" style="s2">let&#39;s look at what the epidemiology for</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.270" end="00:39:17.690" style="s2">the whole world could be because we</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.279" end="00:39:20.109" style="s2">don&#39;t know originally there was a hope</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.690" end="00:39:22.760" style="s2">that this would follow seasonality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.109" end="00:39:24.950" style="s2">either led up a bunch in the summer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.760" end="00:39:27.799" style="s2">or as a result of temperature effects</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.950" end="00:39:29.869" style="s2">not really hit one countries as much we</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.799" end="00:39:30.900" style="s2">now see it spreading rapidly in Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.869" end="00:39:34.349" style="s2">and in other</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.900" end="00:39:36.869" style="s2">warmer Asian places and so that hope has</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.349" end="00:39:38.849" style="s2">been kind of thwarted it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.869" end="00:39:41.490" style="s2">there are aren&#39;t any places that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.849" end="00:39:43.319" style="s2">unsusceptible so there are places that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.490" end="00:39:44.520" style="s2">are earlier in the curve and later in</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.319" end="00:39:47.789" style="s2">the curve in some place that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.520" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">been reached yet but unless some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.789" end="00:39:52.380" style="s2">massive measures are taken to not be</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:55.859" style="s2">reached and they will so specifically</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.380" end="00:39:58.109" style="s2">what happens when India gets hit China</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.859" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">has a huge population but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.109" end="00:40:01.559" style="s2">have to quarantine their whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:02.940" style="s2">population they had to do some measures</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.559" end="00:40:04.529" style="s2">across the whole population but they</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.940" end="00:40:06.859" style="s2">were able to contain to a province</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.910" end="00:40:29.880" style="s2">protect against transmission there what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:32.010" style="s2">happens same with Mexico City right same</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.010" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">Bangladesh that have high populations</p>

<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:44.700" style="s2">good preparedness capacities okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.420" end="00:40:46.859" style="s2">we see and we see that first world</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.700" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">countries are getting destroyed right we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.859" end="00:40:51.960" style="s2">see that Italy is in that position and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:55.020" style="s2">and that other European countries right</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.960" end="00:40:56.099" style="s2">Merkel said probably 70 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.020" end="00:40:58.589" style="s2">country is going to get infected</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.099" end="00:41:00.059" style="s2">eventually like the very serious kinds</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.589" end="00:41:01.980" style="s2">of things we see what&#39;s happening to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.059" end="00:41:04.680" style="s2">EU as a result of this since they use</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.980" end="00:41:06.270" style="s2">not actually supporting Italy and not</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">able to support Eastern European</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.270" end="00:41:10.950" style="s2">countries and then China stepping in to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:13.529" style="s2">offer help so now China was on the front</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.950" end="00:41:15.869" style="s2">of this curve which also and they took</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.529" end="00:41:18.900" style="s2">very strong responses so they are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.869" end="00:41:21.240" style="s2">farthest ahead of being able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.900" end="00:41:22.829" style="s2">international aid in response China was</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:24.450" style="s2">already the place that did most of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.829" end="00:41:31.349" style="s2">manufacturing of medical equipment in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.450" end="00:41:33.450" style="s2">the first place and so in one way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.349" end="00:41:35.539" style="s2">looking at it and China got a massive</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.450" end="00:41:37.230" style="s2">economic hit and there were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.539" end="00:41:38.819" style="s2">companies that wanted to pull</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.230" end="00:41:40.500" style="s2">manufacturing out of China which could</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.819" end="00:41:43.049" style="s2">be a massive very long term head for</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.500" end="00:41:43.670" style="s2">China since exporters such a huge part</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.049" end="00:41:45.589" style="s2">of their business</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.670" end="00:41:48.650" style="s2">it affected overall you know public</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.589" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">sentiment towards them so in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.650" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">they got hit hard but on other ways you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:56.359" style="s2">know it&#39;s just two months later and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:42:01.010" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to loosen quarantine no</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.359" end="00:42:02.540" style="s2">new cases in Wuhan and they&#39;re opening</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.010" end="00:42:04.690" style="s2">Apple stores and Starbucks stores</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.540" end="00:42:09.549" style="s2">throughout the country again right plus</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.690" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">offering masks and ventilators and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.549" end="00:42:14.510" style="s2">training and aid and you know medical</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">knowledge and equipment to places that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.510" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">need it so we&#39;ve seen that in Italy</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:23.089" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in some Eastern European</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">places we saw to the EU as a whole so in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.089" end="00:42:27.589" style="s2">some ways China&#39;s in a stronger position</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.400" end="00:42:30.170" style="s2">than it&#39;s ever been because they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.589" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2">the other side of this they mobilized</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.170" end="00:42:35.930" style="s2">into a crisis wartime response type mode</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.500" end="00:42:37.790" style="s2">and they have the Medical Response</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">equipment and those types of things they</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.790" end="00:42:41.720" style="s2">were already geopolitically very savvy</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:43.069" style="s2">with the Belden Road initiative and all</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.720" end="00:42:44.660" style="s2">of the work they were doing to be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.069" end="00:42:46.280" style="s2">to get international support and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.660" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">coordination for their geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.280" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">agendas the u.s. appears to be moving</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:58.040" style="s2">into one of the weakest positions it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:59.930" style="s2">been in a very long time and because of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.040" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">not having early strong response and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.930" end="00:43:03.140" style="s2">can&#39;t just do specialized quarantines</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">because there are some people in all 50</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.140" end="00:43:06.230" style="s2">states and we don&#39;t have the Diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:09.319" style="s2">ready could we be in a very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.230" end="00:43:11.420" style="s2">position for a long time I&#39;ve heard UK</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.319" end="00:43:13.369" style="s2">and US federal governments both talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.420" end="00:43:15.079" style="s2">about 18 months now after the paper that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.369" end="00:43:20.420" style="s2">came out from Imperial College talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.079" end="00:43:21.829" style="s2">about that so what happens if China is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.420" end="00:43:26.660" style="s2">in a very strong position yes in a weak</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.829" end="00:43:29.900" style="s2">position and could they start dumping US</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.660" end="00:43:32.030" style="s2">Treasury bonds could they start with</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.900" end="00:43:33.740" style="s2">cyberattacks whatever not just them lots</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.030" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">of state actors non-state actors right</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.740" end="00:43:39.170" style="s2">do we have if the police are redirected</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.849" style="s2">then where does that open up criminality</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.170" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">if the government&#39;s attention is damaged</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.849" end="00:43:46.730" style="s2">or redirected where does that open up</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">vulnerabilities that&#39;s obviously going</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.730" end="00:43:51.020" style="s2">to happen everywhere but there&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:53.030" style="s2">many places in the world that would have</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.020" end="00:43:55.279" style="s2">predatory opportunism for Italy as</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.030" end="00:43:58.130" style="s2">they&#39;d have for the US right</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.279" end="00:44:02.390" style="s2">or the UK but particularly look at kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.130" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">of superpower tensions here and but</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.390" end="00:44:09.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing that isn&#39;t direct war</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:11.630" style="s2">which is just China being able to do a</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.919" end="00:44:13.339" style="s2">good job of offering international aid</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.630" end="00:44:15.529" style="s2">in exchange for joining the Belden Road</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.339" end="00:44:17.509" style="s2">initiative and then oh by the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.529" end="00:44:19.849" style="s2">dollars are really dirty and transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.509" end="00:44:21.289" style="s2">coronavirus let&#39;s move to digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.849" end="00:44:25.189" style="s2">currency oh by the way we have a digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.289" end="00:44:26.869" style="s2">currency let&#39;s roll it out and or you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.189" end="00:44:30.229" style="s2">can only get our aid in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.869" end="00:44:31.669" style="s2">currency or that was already something</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.229" end="00:44:33.589" style="s2">that was being considered and in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.669" end="00:44:35.179" style="s2">works I was a turn on to this originally</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.589" end="00:44:39.409" style="s2">by Alex Gladstein from the human rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.179" end="00:44:42.650" style="s2">foundation that there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.409" end="00:44:44.869" style="s2">countries that were already too fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.650" end="00:44:47.059" style="s2">dependent upon Chinese infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.869" end="00:44:49.249" style="s2">like being the only telecom in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.059" end="00:44:52.099" style="s2">countries and obviously the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.249" end="00:44:53.539" style="s2">predatory debt lending for fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.099" end="00:44:55.099" style="s2">infrastructure where they could say we</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.539" end="00:44:57.589" style="s2">will now only accept payment and all you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.099" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">need payment portal but because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.589" end="00:45:01.699" style="s2">government-sponsored digital payments</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:04.009" style="s2">there&#39;s no anonymity to the money at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.699" end="00:45:05.299" style="s2">right so there&#39;s there&#39;s no separation</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.009" end="00:45:07.009" style="s2">between the private sector and the</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.009" end="00:45:13.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a perfectly monitor of all</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.249" end="00:45:16.609" style="s2">would also become a world currency world</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.609" end="00:45:25.579" style="s2">primary one used or couldn&#39;t so I want</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.949" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">the u.s. to ramp up its capability to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.579" end="00:45:31.849" style="s2">respond to this domestically and to</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.969" end="00:45:38.959" style="s2">happen during this time and ramp up its</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.309" end="00:45:41.509" style="s2">ability to start offering international</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.959" end="00:45:43.429" style="s2">aid I would like the UK and the US</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.429" end="00:45:48.499" style="s2">else who would be in the right place due</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.650" end="00:45:50.059" style="s2">to a partner in that and we&#39;re nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.499" end="00:45:52.130" style="s2">close to that but we could it would</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.059" end="00:45:54.049" style="s2">require a world war two level</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.130" end="00:45:56.269" style="s2">mobilization full-court press on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.049" end="00:45:57.890" style="s2">capability to do it we see that the</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.349" end="00:50:16.779" style="s2">so to have frame control of this you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:21.260" style="s2">absolutely want to be able to respond</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.779" end="00:50:23.450" style="s2">anticipatorily and 18 months of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.260" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">quarantine would be really really bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.450" end="00:50:28.010" style="s2">but two or three months people can live</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:29.809" style="s2">with people like churches need to come</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">together and say we&#39;re not gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.809" end="00:50:35.730" style="s2">together physically but we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:45.030" style="s2">we&#39;re making sure that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.170" end="00:50:46.020" style="s2">don&#39;t have resources and the older</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.030" end="00:50:47.880" style="s2">vulnerable people are getting the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.020" end="00:50:50.790" style="s2">resources we&#39;re being used as hubs to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.880" end="00:50:52.890" style="s2">you know provision the gear there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.790" end="00:50:56.130" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of things that can be done</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.890" end="00:50:58.290" style="s2">to be able to support so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.130" end="00:51:01.710" style="s2">proposal that I recommend that I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.290" end="00:51:04.349" style="s2">like to see happen I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.710" end="00:51:05.970" style="s2">for the US and I I don&#39;t know the UK</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.349" end="00:51:08.310" style="s2">situation as well but I believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.970" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">probably quite similar I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.310" end="00:51:13.980" style="s2">see a total nationwide quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">immediately effective immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.980" end="00:51:21.570" style="s2">what that means is if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:24.650" style="s2">job that societal function requires you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.570" end="00:51:30.060" style="s2">to go out to work for then you stay home</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.650" end="00:51:33.030" style="s2">so if you run utilities or critical</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.060" end="00:51:36.599" style="s2">supply chain or first responder or</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.030" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">whatever then you need to get then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.599" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">government has to be able to provision</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:46.890" style="s2">personal protective equipment and hazmat</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:48.630" style="s2">gear and training to all of those people</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.890" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">the training is critical because even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.630" end="00:51:51.630" style="s2">you have the gear and you use it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:53.550" style="s2">tiniest bit wrong touch the outside of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.630" end="00:51:57.089" style="s2">something while you&#39;re removing it then</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.550" end="00:51:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s completely worthless and this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.089" end="00:52:00.390" style="s2">again a situation where the money that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.560" end="00:52:01.650" style="s2">was cut to the CDC in office of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.390" end="00:52:04.500" style="s2">pandemics and like that was really</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.650" end="00:52:06.210" style="s2">disastrous because we need more of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.500" end="00:52:08.609" style="s2">people to have been trained already and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.210" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">have gear already and to have earlier</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.609" end="00:52:13.380" style="s2">response capacity and better</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">coordination had we responded early we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.380" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">would have had a recurring kong&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:20.970" style="s2">you shut down the borders tend to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:25.589" style="s2">first few people that are sick and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.970" end="00:52:27.420" style="s2">that&#39;s it right then you have a South</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.589" end="00:52:30.330" style="s2">Korea type case where a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.420" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">get infected but you so you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.330" end="00:52:34.050" style="s2">kind of prevent anyone getting infected</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:35.400" style="s2">but you respond very strong you do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.050" end="00:52:36.990" style="s2">quarantines you do the personal</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.400" end="00:52:39.240" style="s2">protective equipment and the sanitizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.990" end="00:52:42.650" style="s2">and the social distancing and you do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.240" end="00:52:45.220" style="s2">very strong Diagnostics early on and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.650" end="00:52:47.230" style="s2">tracing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.220" end="00:52:51.070" style="s2">you have the curve flatten very steeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.230" end="00:52:53.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s important understand that South</p>

<p begin="00:53:29.170" end="00:53:32.980" style="s2">getting is it the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.090" end="00:53:36.849" style="s2">exponential curve or what&#39;s what do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.980" end="00:53:38.950" style="s2">think of the blocks right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.849" end="00:53:41.500" style="s2">the Imperial College piece that came out</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.950" end="00:53:44.560" style="s2">really changed the UK and the u.s. is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.500" end="00:53:46.450" style="s2">perspective it seems because they they</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.560" end="00:53:50.140" style="s2">got oh fuck this isn&#39;t the flu this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.450" end="00:53:52.890" style="s2">serious and we collapse of ICU looks</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.140" end="00:53:56.410" style="s2">really ugly and we don&#39;t even know about</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.890" end="00:53:57.730" style="s2">convert immunity so the whole just naive</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.410" end="00:53:59.650" style="s2">this is not going to be that big a deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.730" end="00:54:00.670" style="s2">or we all need hurt immunity anyways and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.650" end="00:54:02.290" style="s2">we&#39;ll just call a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.670" end="00:54:06.190" style="s2">population those are just gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.290" end="00:54:09.849" style="s2">ideas and I think that we were running</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.190" end="00:54:14.710" style="s2">on gibberish ideas there&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.849" end="00:54:17.830" style="s2">alternate hypotheses about different</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.710" end="00:54:19.540" style="s2">intentions I don&#39;t think that it matters</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.830" end="00:54:20.920" style="s2">to speculate on that right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.540" end="00:54:23.859" style="s2">what matters is to just get appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.920" end="00:54:25.900" style="s2">responses and the appropriate response</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.859" end="00:54:27.250" style="s2">right now is that even though we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.900" end="00:54:30.609" style="s2">people in all 50 states that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.250" end="00:54:32.500" style="s2">infected and but that&#39;s not evenly</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.609" end="00:54:34.570" style="s2">distributed we still have 50% of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.500" end="00:54:36.790" style="s2">cases in five or six counties which</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.570" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">means that we do have to do a very smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.790" end="00:54:40.869" style="s2">coordinated triage approach where do we</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:42.580" style="s2">get the rate-limiting gear the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.869" end="00:54:44.380" style="s2">Diagnostics does have to be equal</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.580" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">quarantine everywhere no right what does</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.380" end="00:54:49.930" style="s2">a smart approach look like requires much</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:53.830" style="s2">better coordination and much faster</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.930" end="00:54:55.750" style="s2">responses than we&#39;ve had but as is right</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.830" end="00:54:58.270" style="s2">now the total percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.750" end="00:55:00.819" style="s2">population affected is so small</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.270" end="00:55:02.589" style="s2">right but with a three-day doubling time</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.819" end="00:55:08.020" style="s2">that changes very quickly and you reach</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.589" end="00:55:10.270" style="s2">saturation in less than two months now</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.020" end="00:55:11.589" style="s2">when we say reach saturation like 70% of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.270" end="00:55:13.030" style="s2">the population list in two months that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.589" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">if no measures are instituted we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.030" end="00:55:15.490" style="s2">already see they&#39;re being instituted</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:18.579" style="s2">even if not the federal government level</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.490" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">California just implemented a policy</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.579" end="00:55:22.270" style="s2">statewide and many cities are</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.670" style="s2">implementing at their city level and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.270" end="00:55:26.770" style="s2">lot of people are voluntarily quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.670" end="00:55:28.839" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to dampen the curve but</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.770" end="00:55:32.549" style="s2">it needs to be dampened much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.839" end="00:55:39.430" style="s2">radically so why have we not before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.549" end="00:55:42.569" style="s2">some combination of miscalculating being</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.430" end="00:55:45.190" style="s2">more afraid of the economic hits and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.569" end="00:55:50.589" style="s2">calculating how bad the economic hits of</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.190" end="00:55:55.900" style="s2">it hitting catastrophic infection levels</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.589" end="00:55:59.319" style="s2">would be just rampant coordination</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.900" end="00:56:00.670" style="s2">failure cut resources to the areas that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.319" end="00:56:06.369" style="s2">would normally know how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.670" end="00:56:09.940" style="s2">this appropriately but I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.369" end="00:56:12.430" style="s2">don&#39;t want anyone focused on who did</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.940" end="00:56:14.049" style="s2">what dumb things right now which creates</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.430" end="00:56:15.609" style="s2">more coordination failure I want</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.049" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">everyone working together in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.609" end="00:56:20.829" style="s2">nonpartisan way to just stop this then</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:25.630" style="s2">we can come back to domestic politics of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.829" end="00:56:28.540" style="s2">that kind but if we have any kind of red</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.630" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">blue left/right nonsense right now lots</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.540" end="00:56:31.500" style="s2">more people will die and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.420" style="s2">catastrophic effects will be worse so</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.500" end="00:56:36.250" style="s2">this needs to be unified response within</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.420" end="00:56:37.960" style="s2">countries and between countries they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.250" end="00:56:40.030" style="s2">also obviously viruses don&#39;t give you</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.960" end="00:56:44.230" style="s2">shit about borders they only care about</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.030" end="00:56:45.609" style="s2">transmission and so that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.230" end="00:56:47.619" style="s2">thing is that national governments</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.609" end="00:56:49.030" style="s2">cannot respond to pandemics they can</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.619" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">respond but they can&#39;t solely respond</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.030" end="00:56:54.790" style="s2">that requires international coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:58.150" style="s2">responses I want to see nationwide</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.790" end="00:57:00.010" style="s2">quarantine it&#39;s the only way to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.150" end="00:57:02.280" style="s2">spread because the spread is human to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.010" end="00:57:06.339" style="s2">human or human to surface to human and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.280" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">if you stop the social transmission it</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.339" end="00:57:14.230" style="s2">stops it&#39;s important to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:18.460" style="s2">that viruses don&#39;t care about speeches</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.230" end="00:57:20.850" style="s2">or politics or economic interests like</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.460" end="00:57:24.460" style="s2">they&#39;re just it&#39;s biologists physics and</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.850" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">this is one of the things that we you</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.460" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">know in in general there&#39;s this truism</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:32.170" style="s2">that the generals who are at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">the military during peacetime are not</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.170" end="00:57:34.870" style="s2">necessary the ones we&#39;re best at winning</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:37.030" style="s2">wars so when we move into wartime</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.870" end="00:57:38.530" style="s2">sometimes they start losing battles and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.030" end="00:57:40.390" style="s2">we kind of have to rotate through a few</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.530" end="00:57:41.560" style="s2">times till we find people like Churchill</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.390" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">and patents that are good at winning</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.560" end="00:57:44.380" style="s2">wars that we wouldn&#39;t necessarily want</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:48.010" style="s2">these times because kind of politicians</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.380" end="00:57:51.130" style="s2">or diplomats I see that happening now</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.010" end="00:57:55.210" style="s2">where you can for a lot of issues that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.130" end="00:57:57.610" style="s2">are just are social constructs speeches</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.210" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">and what people think and what they feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.610" end="00:58:01.390" style="s2">and being able to just dope the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:02.770" style="s2">information ecology is adequate because</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.390" end="00:58:04.390" style="s2">we&#39;re just trying to move human</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.770" end="00:58:05.500" style="s2">sentiment viruses don&#39;t give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.390" end="00:58:07.350" style="s2">about that so we&#39;re actually dealing</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.500" end="00:58:09.460" style="s2">with base physics again right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.350" end="00:58:13.060" style="s2">overwhelmed ICU doesn&#39;t give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.460" end="00:58:14.260" style="s2">about that and critical infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.060" end="00:58:15.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of these things which like</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.260" end="00:58:18.670" style="s2">oh we&#39;re actually dealing with physics</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.700" end="00:58:20.560" style="s2">again and so doing politics will not</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.670" end="00:58:22.450" style="s2">help them so anyone who only knows how</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.560" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">to do politics and is at the top because</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.450" end="00:58:26.200" style="s2">they were selected for during that time</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:29.590" style="s2">we&#39;ll just keep failing and whoever</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.200" end="00:58:32.050" style="s2">knows how to actually do real physics</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.590" end="00:58:35.070" style="s2">biology logistics capable stuff will get</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.050" end="00:58:40.510" style="s2">up regulated during this time</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.070" end="00:58:42.190" style="s2">okay so quarantine to stop the spread</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.510" end="00:58:44.500" style="s2">now I would like to see that called for</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.190" end="00:58:45.730" style="s2">it a nationwide level I&#39;d also like to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.500" end="00:58:47.230" style="s2">see it called for at a statewide level</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.730" end="00:58:49.270" style="s2">because if it isn&#39;t called of the nation</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.230" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">level states can do that right I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.270" end="00:58:52.300" style="s2">like to see it called for by mayor&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:53.800" style="s2">a city level I would like to see the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.300" end="00:58:55.960" style="s2">celebrities come out and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.800" end="00:58:57.670" style="s2">everyone using their all the channels</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.960" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">they have hey stay the fuck home because</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.670" end="00:59:01.540" style="s2">right now people pay more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:03.730" style="s2">celebrities than to epidemiologists even</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.540" end="00:59:06.340" style="s2">in a life-or-death situation so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.730" end="00:59:08.350" style="s2">celebrity should confer their celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.340" end="00:59:09.820" style="s2">power to the epidemiologists and save</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.350" end="00:59:11.940" style="s2">lives they don&#39;t usually have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.820" end="00:59:14.080" style="s2">opportunity to save lives and help</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.940" end="00:59:15.550" style="s2">national security and all those things</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.080" end="00:59:19.810" style="s2">right now the way they did before</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.550" end="00:59:21.400" style="s2">and if they&#39;re left oriented save lives</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.810" end="00:59:22.840" style="s2">if they&#39;re right oriented national</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.400" end="00:59:24.850" style="s2">security again it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.840" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">matter it&#39;s the same thing on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.850" end="00:59:31.810" style="s2">at this particular point I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:33.400" style="s2">that both left and right wouldn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.810" end="00:59:34.810" style="s2">about both things I just mean whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.400" end="00:59:40.450" style="s2">it is someone cares about it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.810" end="00:59:42.550" style="s2">the same answer here so all of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.450" end="00:59:44.260" style="s2">approaches that can be taken to stop</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.550" end="00:59:48.220" style="s2">social transmission should be the first</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.260" end="00:59:52.570" style="s2">order and then in order for that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.220" end="00:59:55.050" style="s2">happen we have to do the economic</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.570" end="00:59:57.460" style="s2">support and stimulus packages that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.050" end="01:00:02.140" style="s2">people will actually stay home and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.460" end="01:00:06.220" style="s2">can occur so that means stopping rents</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.140" end="01:00:08.050" style="s2">and mortgages insurance that small</p>

<p begin="01:01:07.990" end="01:01:12.940" style="s2">mentioned many of the areas but you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.900" end="01:01:14.710" style="s2">you can factor what those areas are</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.940" end="01:01:20.380" style="s2">healthcare first responders</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.710" end="01:01:22.990" style="s2">infrastructure utilities etc vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.380" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">populations particularly need very hard</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.840" end="01:01:40.310" style="s2">we can&#39;t have spreading happening within</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.220" end="01:01:42.230" style="s2">those it&#39;ll be too much of a disaster so</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.310" end="01:01:48.830" style="s2">those should be particularly fiercely</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.230" end="01:01:51.310" style="s2">protected so next after quarantine and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.830" end="01:01:57.410" style="s2">all that it takes to make that happen</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.310" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">the focus is a full-court press with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.410" end="01:02:02.110" style="s2">private sector and the government</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:04.670" style="s2">working together to ramp a high quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.110" end="01:02:06.350" style="s2">Diagnostics so that we can do a bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.670" end="01:02:08.680" style="s2">witness Diagnostics so we can move from</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.350" end="01:02:11.870" style="s2">a total quarantine to a smart quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.680" end="01:02:13.810" style="s2">so a lot of people will protest we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.870" end="01:02:16.340" style="s2">have that many tests yet that&#39;s true or</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.810" end="01:02:18.200" style="s2">the turnaround time on the test is too</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.340" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">slow or there&#39;s too many false negatives</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.200" end="01:02:22.220" style="s2">or the tests only show up after people</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:23.960" style="s2">have been sick it for a while yes all</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.220" end="01:02:25.730" style="s2">that&#39;s true on the tests that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.960" end="01:02:27.890" style="s2">so when I&#39;m saying we need to ramp up</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.730" end="01:02:33.290" style="s2">Diagnostics adequate Diagnostics what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.890" end="01:02:36.040" style="s2">mean is it&#39;s not a single strategy we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.290" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">been collecting all of the diagnostic</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.040" end="01:02:42.500" style="s2">technology surplus new diagnostic tech</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:44.180" style="s2">in one place so that we can be seeing</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.500" end="01:02:45.740" style="s2">which ones have the capability to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.180" end="01:02:47.870" style="s2">what types of things where and have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.740" end="01:02:49.750" style="s2">multi-pronged strategy if there&#39;s anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.870" end="01:02:52.520" style="s2">who has real capability to help that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.750" end="01:02:55.960" style="s2">financial or logistic please contact me</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.520" end="01:03:00.170" style="s2">can do that through facebook Messenger</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.960" end="01:03:01.820" style="s2">but so we need to get the tests that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.170" end="01:03:03.950" style="s2">currently exists even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.820" end="01:03:08.270" style="s2">inadequate to all the places that need</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.950" end="01:03:11.600" style="s2">them most so a triage to the places</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.270" end="01:03:15.140" style="s2">where the most spread can occur right</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.600" end="01:03:17.720" style="s2">there the following tracing of contacted</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.140" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">individuals the counties that have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.720" end="01:03:23.900" style="s2">most impact etc we need to ramp the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:27.410" style="s2">production of tests that can be ramped</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.900" end="01:03:30.290" style="s2">in time even if their partial tests even</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.410" end="01:03:31.850" style="s2">though antibodies show up too late to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.290" end="01:03:33.350" style="s2">able to do prevention we need antibody</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.850" end="01:03:35.480" style="s2">tests because we want to be able to see</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.350" end="01:03:37.280" style="s2">his immunity conferred and if so who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.480" end="01:03:42.050" style="s2">immune because I&#39;d be very helpful the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:46.920" style="s2">kind of testing that I care most about</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.050" end="01:03:49.859" style="s2">at this point is testing</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.920" end="01:03:52.200" style="s2">that can detect cases as early as</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.859" end="01:03:54.359" style="s2">possible after exposure with very high</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.200" end="01:03:57.680" style="s2">sensitivities a very low rate of false</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.359" end="01:04:01.049" style="s2">negatives very fast turnaround time and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.680" end="01:04:03.450" style="s2">not having rate limiting reagents and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.049" end="01:04:06.660" style="s2">this is the drive-through style testings</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.450" end="01:04:08.520" style="s2">health Korea implemented there are a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.660" end="01:04:10.920" style="s2">companies that have technologies that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.520" end="01:04:13.069" style="s2">are much better that can ramp in time</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.920" end="01:04:16.170" style="s2">and we&#39;re working on those those need</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.069" end="01:04:19.140" style="s2">capital and support so that being said</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.170" end="01:04:20.819" style="s2">if people have that but the drive-thru</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.140" end="01:04:24.990" style="s2">type testing so let&#39;s just imagine a</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.819" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">scenario where Walmart in Walgreens type</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.990" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">parking lots get drive-through test</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:33.960" style="s2">capability so that somebody pulls in</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:35.730" style="s2">automatically video camera registers</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.960" end="01:04:38.130" style="s2">their license plate their driver&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.730" end="01:04:40.230" style="s2">license gets taken they&#39;re tested if</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.130" end="01:04:42.030" style="s2">they are positive they go directly into</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.230" end="01:04:43.319" style="s2">quarantine as a result they get early</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.030" end="01:04:48.020" style="s2">treatment and they don&#39;t have to go to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.319" end="01:04:48.020" style="s2">ICU and we&#39;re able to separate a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.290" end="01:04:52.440" style="s2">quarantine people being quarantined at</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.819" end="01:04:53.730" style="s2">home means the whole family gets it in</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.440" end="01:04:55.230" style="s2">the most vulnerable people get it so</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.730" end="01:04:56.819" style="s2">being able to have quarantine facilities</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.230" end="01:04:58.170" style="s2">where then the rest of the family is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.819" end="01:05:00.359" style="s2">treated as exposed and we get</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.170" end="01:05:01.710" style="s2">Diagnostics to them but if they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.359" end="01:05:07.380" style="s2">already all been infected they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.710" end="01:05:09.990" style="s2">have to be is important and yeah people</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.380" end="01:05:12.270" style="s2">can get on early treatments and we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.990" end="01:05:14.309" style="s2">separate people who need to go to ICU</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.270" end="01:05:16.440" style="s2">for normal non coronavirus reasons</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.309" end="01:05:18.680" style="s2">versus those with coronavirus and be</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.440" end="01:05:20.760" style="s2">able to separate facilities for that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.680" end="01:05:22.680" style="s2">we&#39;re also going to see that as the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.760" end="01:05:24.420" style="s2">doctors and nurses get sick but if they</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.680" end="01:05:25.950" style="s2">have access to early testing so they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.420" end="01:05:27.450" style="s2">get on early treatment many of them</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.950" end="01:05:28.530" style="s2">either because their symptoms wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.450" end="01:05:30.059" style="s2">have been that bad anyways because</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.530" end="01:05:31.440" style="s2">they&#39;re young and healthy or because of</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.059" end="01:05:34.380" style="s2">the early treatment we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.440" end="01:05:36.210" style="s2">keep working but they can&#39;t run the risk</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.380" end="01:05:38.359" style="s2">of infecting other people so you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.210" end="01:05:41.700" style="s2">have the negative pressure</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.359" end="01:05:44.730" style="s2">Kove aid facilities and infected doctors</p>

<p begin="01:05:49.859" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">things like that so people drive in they</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.599" end="01:05:59.700" style="s2">go into an appropriate quarantine and</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:00.660" style="s2">response if they&#39;re positive if they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.369" end="01:06:33.799" style="s2">off of total quarantine with a smart</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.410" end="01:06:58.920" style="s2">but also afterwards we want to make sure</p>

<p begin="01:06:58.920" end="01:07:01.859" style="s2">when does someone come off quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.299" end="01:07:03.030" style="s2">well it can&#39;t be an X number of days</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.859" end="01:07:04.619" style="s2">because there&#39;s going to be a long</p>

<p begin="01:07:12.089" end="01:07:18.059" style="s2">then people who were either not infected</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.940" end="01:07:20.520" style="s2">or are no longer infected can go back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.059" end="01:07:22.230" style="s2">work and you know off of quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.520" end="01:07:24.270" style="s2">still with personal protective gear</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.230" end="01:07:26.520" style="s2">social distancing wiping down doorknobs</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.270" end="01:07:28.049" style="s2">all those types of things because they</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.520" end="01:07:30.329" style="s2">have to assume that some people who are</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.329" end="01:07:35.130" style="s2">case number drops to very very low which</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.760" end="01:07:36.450" style="s2">is exactly what China is doing and South</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.130" end="01:07:38.279" style="s2">Korea is doing once the total case</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.450" end="01:07:41.849" style="s2">number is very low then life can return</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.279" end="01:07:44.069" style="s2">to normal but this can happen in like</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.849" end="01:07:46.470" style="s2">eight to ten weeks where we go from</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.069" end="01:07:49.109" style="s2">total quarantine to smart quarantine</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.839" end="01:08:01.470" style="s2">break of the US or global economy now if</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.490" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">you start thinking about trillions of</p>

<p begin="01:08:14.289" end="01:08:18.099" style="s2">obviously make sense right to be able to</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.659" end="01:08:29.049" style="s2">obviously during that time we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.400" end="01:08:31.389" style="s2">going to be ramping the ISEE use</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.049" end="01:08:33.460" style="s2">capabilities and we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.389" end="01:08:36.849" style="s2">ramping treatment so treatments from</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.619" end="01:08:51.790" style="s2">people can get early diagnostics and</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.869" end="01:08:53.770" style="s2">then get treated and basically be fine</p>

<p begin="01:09:09.339" end="01:09:14.139" style="s2">will be ramping so quarantine and all</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.670" end="01:09:16.839" style="s2">the things it takes to make that happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.139" end="01:09:18.609" style="s2">ramp the Diagnostics to become</p>

<p begin="01:09:20.679" end="01:09:28.449" style="s2">quarantine and the ramp of treatments if</p>

<p begin="01:09:34.710" end="01:09:41.980" style="s2">but I am expecting the treatments to be</p>

<p begin="01:09:41.980" end="01:09:47.170" style="s2">dealing with the medical stuff then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.049" end="01:09:50.049" style="s2">also ramp all of the vulnerabilities and</p>

<p begin="01:10:03.699" end="01:10:08.010" style="s2">really most want to see and as far as at</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.800" end="01:10:10.829" style="s2">a bottom-up level we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.010" end="01:10:13.059" style="s2">incredible responses of community</p>

<p begin="01:10:27.350" end="01:10:32.450" style="s2">and not great coordinating so if anyone</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.450" end="01:10:35.600" style="s2">to do something can look to see who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.160" end="01:10:37.940" style="s2">already doing it are there groups that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:39.710" style="s2">have good ability and more traction and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.940" end="01:10:42.890" style="s2">join them that would be really more</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.710" end="01:10:44.780" style="s2">helpful if you&#39;re wanting to see how to</p>

<p begin="01:15:03.710" end="01:15:11.210" style="s2">time so we have to factor that all of</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.300" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">a number of reasons it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.070" end="01:16:20.510" style="s2">interesting to think about the way that</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.130" style="s2">the u.s. emerged as the superpower</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.510" end="01:16:24.290" style="s2">coming out of World War two that it</p>

<p begin="01:16:39.020" end="01:16:45.380" style="s2">came out of World War two if you want a</p>

<p begin="01:16:45.380" end="01:16:49.880" style="s2">than the amount of time they&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.610" end="01:16:51.680" style="s2">lasted you have to reboot them because</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.880" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">institutional decay does occur so</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.680" end="01:16:55.460" style="s2">reboots are needed which is a super</p>

<p begin="01:16:55.460" end="01:16:58.790" style="s2">make civilizations that collapse but for</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.620" end="01:17:00.590" style="s2">the first time ever we have a fully</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.790" end="01:17:01.940" style="s2">globalized civilization so collapse</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.590" end="01:17:04.640" style="s2">means something it&#39;s summer meant</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.940" end="01:17:07.250" style="s2">for we have caused environmental damage</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.640" end="01:17:08.720" style="s2">locally that desertified the topsoil we</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.250" end="01:17:10.880" style="s2">couldn&#39;t feed the people but we could</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.720" end="01:17:13.460" style="s2">never actually make the entire biosphere</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.880" end="01:17:15.440" style="s2">fucked up right we couldn&#39;t do species</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.460" end="01:17:17.350" style="s2">extinction at scale everywhere or mess</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.440" end="01:17:20.090" style="s2">the entire oceans up or things like that</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.350" end="01:17:22.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a Chinese civilization in</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.090" end="01:17:23.960" style="s2">a u.s. civilization because if either of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.190" end="01:17:26.510" style="s2">them fully failed the other one would</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.960" end="01:17:28.190" style="s2">also fail because of completely</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.190" end="01:17:35.990" style="s2">and completely interdependent biosphere</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.880" end="01:17:38.720" style="s2">type dynamics so we are facing a</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.990" end="01:17:40.610" style="s2">collapse of a civilization or an empire</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.720" end="01:17:44.390" style="s2">but where the scale of it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.610" end="01:17:46.940" style="s2">unprecedented the next part that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.390" end="01:17:48.590" style="s2">really critical to get is that we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.940" end="01:17:51.410" style="s2">used our power either directly</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.590" end="01:17:54.380" style="s2">militarily in ways that cause harm or</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.410" end="01:17:56.470" style="s2">indirectly through in ways that cause</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.520" end="01:18:05.210" style="s2">externalities of various kinds but we</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.510" end="01:18:07.220" style="s2">never had tech where even if we wanted</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.210" end="01:18:09.500" style="s2">to we could fuck up everything at a</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.250" end="01:18:23.570" style="s2">the technology they had so that&#39;s why</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.570" end="01:18:28.070" style="s2">two created the emergence of a world</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.430" end="01:18:39.500" style="s2">was like a second ago and that was the</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.610" end="01:18:41.210" style="s2">beginning of us having truly globally</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.500" end="01:18:43.190" style="s2">catastrophic capability so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.210" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">using any forecasting from before that</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.190" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s nonsense in terms of what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:51.520" style="s2">harm we didn&#39;t do because we also</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:54.170" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.520" end="01:18:55.910" style="s2">the only stuff that&#39;s relevant is what</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.170" end="01:18:58.700" style="s2">kind of harm could we do and we did</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.910" end="01:19:02.210" style="s2">right so then factor the new capability</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.700" end="01:19:03.920" style="s2">so World War two the Bretton Woods world</p>

<p begin="01:19:18.870" end="01:19:23.430" style="s2">fought so we needed to do something that</p>

<p begin="01:19:23.430" end="01:19:29.550" style="s2">that because of a few things we were</p>
