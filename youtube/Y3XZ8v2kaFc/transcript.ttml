<p begin="00:00:00.960" end="00:00:05.680" style="s2">good morning</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:07.359" style="s2">i do what i always do which you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:09.120" style="s2">supposed to do i just grab your phone</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.359" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">first thing in the morning i mainly grab</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.120" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">it to see what time it is and then get</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">sucked into social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">and one of my facebook friends posted</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">this and then i posted a response and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">that is what this video is about</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:22.640" style="s2">the revelation is that there is just two</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.359" style="s2">basic economic states</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.640" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">communism on and communism off when</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">there is capitalism off</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.880" style="s2">when there is capitalism off goes the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">communism</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.880" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">remove the capitalism and only communism</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">remains communism is the origin state</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:38.719" style="s2">and the destiny state and capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:40.640" style="s2">just a phase in between</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.719" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">it takes great energy to keep capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.640" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">on it&#39;s a real waste because capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">is not very economical it&#39;s a tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">because capitalism is expensive toxic</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:50.239" style="s2">extremely unhealthy and brutally</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">it can be this simple mathematical and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.160" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">predictable we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">we want a certain mathematical quality</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">in the future language</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">and the key is not being disappointed as</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">much as to maximize predictability</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">my statement which is what i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">talk about today is capitalism can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:11.439" style="s2">thought of as massive</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">state-led competition and communism is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.439" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">massively</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">state-run cooperation both are massive</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">and not voluntary if you turn off</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">complicated capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">you do not get communism nor should you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">creating what it is you desire is about</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">individuals having i don&#39;t think i made</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">sense when i said that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s about individuals so what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">basically stating what i&#39;m assuming he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">stating in his pose</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">is if we just didn&#39;t have capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">we&#39;d have beautiful beautiful communism</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">and i think no</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">no we would not because i have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">anyone have a beautiful vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">future that doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">enforcing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">with violence on the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">and so to me the difference isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">state-run</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">cooperation or state-run competition</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">because either way you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">people that want to do the other one</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">and aren&#39;t allowed so if you have it be</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">that you just switch from</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">forced competition to force cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">it&#39;s forced and it&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">whereas creating something that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">voluntary cooperation where people can</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">see what they truly get out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">not communism where people</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">one we see historically what happens but</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">you have a tiny group of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">who are at least to the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">running it and saying what quotas are</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">telling you what your job is telling you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">all these things which are still a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">hierarchy down structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">there and therefore there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">tension there</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">and even if that tension is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">theoretically gone from</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">what is best for the individual creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">the rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">and or capitalism to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">creating a world that is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">supposed to be in benefit of all because</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to do it for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">and um it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">as opposed to politicians pretending</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it for their constituents</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">to central planners pretending to do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">for the good of society</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">they&#39;re still going to be working in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">their own best self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">i do think there&#39;s something to what</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">he&#39;s saying that we did go through</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">a more cooperative version of history</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">mainly tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">um that some people are still living in</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">um living off the lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">working within the ecosystem you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">generally you don&#39;t kick people out</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">except in extreme circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re making sure everyone&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">are looked after everyone&#39;s contributing</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">everyone&#39;s getting their needs looked</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">after but when you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">bigger and more complex in society and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">you have a agriculture which of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">in tribal societies have agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">having um once we started on a mass</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">scale having agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">and expanding and colonization happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">over the globe might equal right and gun</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">germs and steel spread competition</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">everywhere and if you weren&#39;t willing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">not only you could you say actually no</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">we&#39;re good we&#39;re just going to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">over here</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">um if you weren&#39;t up to snuff in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">competition you were just annihilated</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">and i hate to say that&#39;s a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">step for us to have gone through because</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">it&#39;s all the shitty shitty things humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">have done to each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">in the last few centuries millennia and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re still there we still need</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">other people to listen to me and do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">my way</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t get us communism or</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">what we need is a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">cooperation and it out competes</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">capitalism it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">out competes mandatory competition and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">voluntary competition</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">on a massive scale because who are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">gonna choose</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">a company whose product is there to make</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">a cooperative that&#39;s there to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">their employees have a decent wage but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">is more there</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">to make sure that that product is safe</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">you know you can take a break from one</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">and play a board game and be in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">competition and take a break from one</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">it spoke to me as it was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">when you turn off capitalism you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t get communism</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">absolutely not but even bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">creating a new state we need a stateless</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">we need something that is fully</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">and when since competition stops being</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">an option</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">you can&#39;t create a competitive amazon to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">compete with our cooperative one</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">we already put the amazon out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">business when you know that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">two decades</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">um so what are you going to create</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">you can create something to be in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">competition with your buddy right</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make a better coke i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">gonna make a better a better uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">plate or table and if that brings you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">joy that&#39;s fine but you can&#39;t start a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">for-profit competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">because when we don&#39;t have patents</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">anyone can just</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">use it and you do it cooperatively and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">you can&#39;t compete with cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">you just can&#39;t and so it eventually</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">leads to a massive cooperative on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">grand scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">when things are more official because</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">anyone can if a solution isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">unlike under communism where what do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not of course it&#39;s working for</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">it has to work it&#39;s communism shut up</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">shut up our gulags that we create</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">always able to be questioned but not</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">right well this sucks great how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">make it better i don&#39;t know but it sucks</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">perhaps you can offer something better</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">even if the food system isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">for you if you can think of a new way</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re not willing to implement it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">there&#39;s ways for you to implement it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">to always have the option of creating</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">which is like competition because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">like i&#39;m improving it this is better</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">that is a little bit competition and yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s available to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s sometimes not as easy as</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">always being better than something else</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s better than some</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">something that already existed to some</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">and so having as many options as</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">as many governance structures as</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">possible so that we can try out what</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t work what makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">us as individuals feel like we belong</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">and we&#39;re contributing and what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s a big conglomerate</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">we can try out different systems we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">play at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">and get to competition or sorry</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">cooperation that we enjoy being part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">not forced cooperation by one tiny teams</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">this is how it should work and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">rolled out to everyone else and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">enforced</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">but hey we all have a cooperative side</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">and we all have a competitive side</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">so how can we tap into your cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">and how can we tap into your competitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">side for good</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">and let&#39;s just keep moving towards that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">because when we create anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">scalable on that level</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">it&#39;s going to take over i&#39;m on it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">thanks for hanging out</p>
