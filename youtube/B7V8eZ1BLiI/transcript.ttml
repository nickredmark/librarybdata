<p begin="00:00:23.759" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of a welcome for someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.199" end="00:00:36.460" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna talk about the Bible so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">thought I would get farther than through</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.460" end="00:00:41.530" style="s2">Genesis by by this point but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">unhappy about the pace either I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.530" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">learned a tremendous amount and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:50.379" style="s2">hopefully what we&#39;ll do today is finish</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:53.129" style="s2">Genesis completely and then I think I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.379" end="00:00:56.079" style="s2">try to start up with Exodus in May</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.129" end="00:00:58.329" style="s2">depending on what happens next year I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.079" end="00:00:59.769" style="s2">have a busy travel schedule and but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.329" end="00:01:01.629" style="s2">would really like to do it I really like</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.769" end="00:01:03.579" style="s2">the Exodus story and I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.629" end="00:01:06.490" style="s2">very well a lot of the stories in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.579" end="00:01:08.200" style="s2">Genesis especially after the first few</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.490" end="00:01:09.460" style="s2">stories say up to the Tower of Babel I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.200" end="00:01:11.170" style="s2">had to do a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.460" end="00:01:13.510" style="s2">learning about which is really good but</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.170" end="00:01:17.590" style="s2">I do know the Exodus story so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.510" end="00:01:19.330" style="s2">looking forward to that so so let&#39;s dive</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.590" end="00:01:24.610" style="s2">right into it and see how far we can get</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.330" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">today so we&#39;ll review first so Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.610" end="00:01:30.580" style="s2">father is Jacob and Jacob is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.720" end="00:01:35.950" style="s2">patriarch of Israel essentially that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.580" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">father of the twelve tribes and we might</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.950" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">remember that he had a very morally</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:50.200" style="s2">ambivalent pathway through life and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.090" end="00:01:52.900" style="s2">one of the things that I think so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.200" end="00:01:57.610" style="s2">interesting about the stories in the in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.900" end="00:01:59.980" style="s2">the Old Testament is that these so</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.610" end="00:02:03.100" style="s2">called patriarchal figures are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.980" end="00:02:05.140" style="s2">realistic and it&#39;s something that I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.100" end="00:02:07.090" style="s2">also being struck by that accounts in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.140" end="00:02:10.629" style="s2">the New Testament that way there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.090" end="00:02:12.190" style="s2">of things that Christ does that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.629" end="00:02:14.200" style="s2">think would have been edited out over</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.190" end="00:02:15.519" style="s2">time and sanitized but they&#39;re not and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.200" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">that the Old Testament is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.519" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">a book that&#39;s been sanitized and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:19.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">quite interesting that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.079" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">so you sort of see people with all their</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:29.719" style="s2">flaws and I&#39;ve been trying to also</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">derive some general conclusions about</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.719" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">them the moral of the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:37.079" style="s2">Genesis stories and because these</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">stories are fundamentally moral and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.079" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">moral as far as I&#39;m concerned has to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:43.889" style="s2">with action right because moral</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:45.959" style="s2">decisions are the decisions that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.889" end="00:02:47.780" style="s2">make when you&#39;re structuring action when</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.959" end="00:02:50.099" style="s2">you decide to do one thing or another</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.780" end="00:02:52.290" style="s2">generally you want to do things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.099" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">the best things that you can think of to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.290" end="00:02:57.239" style="s2">do and hence good but sometimes you also</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:02:58.739" style="s2">want to do things that are they&#39;re worse</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.239" end="00:03:01.439" style="s2">things you can do you know because</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.739" end="00:03:03.659" style="s2">you&#39;re angry or resentful or bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.439" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">so the moral decisions that you make</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.659" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">that govern your actions are really the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:09.389" style="s2">most important decisions that you make</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">in your life and it&#39;s not that easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.389" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">figure out how to make moral decisions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">we don&#39;t have an unerring technology for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">that the same way as we do for say</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:24.620" style="s2">making decisions about empirical reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:26.699" style="s2">which in some ways seem a lot simpler</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.620" end="00:03:28.139" style="s2">partly because we can work collectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.699" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">at it partly because we have a rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.139" end="00:03:34.019" style="s2">methodology for deciding what&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:35.729" style="s2">what&#39;s not so one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.019" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">really struck me like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.729" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">overarching theme I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:43.069" style="s2">emerges out of Genesis especially after</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">the really ancient stories say</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.069" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">especially after the stories of Cain and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:56.129" style="s2">Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:04:00.439" style="s2">when you get to the accounts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.129" end="00:04:04.919" style="s2">historically or historically real people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.439" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">one injunction seems to be get the hell</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">out there and do something you know one</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">of the major themes for all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:18.449" style="s2">patriarchs that we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:20.519" style="s2">Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is move out</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.449" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">into the world regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.519" end="00:04:25.830" style="s2">circumstances at hand now that&#39;s in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">in the Old Testament stories that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.830" end="00:04:30.900" style="s2">basically portrayed as harkening to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">voice of God something like that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.900" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:37.390" style="s2">his destiny or a psychological calling</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">and the funny thing too is is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.390" end="00:04:42.760" style="s2">not that these people have an easy time</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">of it when they heed that call so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.760" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">what&#39;s fascinating is that they often</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:49.480" style="s2">run into extreme difficulties right away</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:52.120" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.480" end="00:04:55.480" style="s2">first of all because life is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.120" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">full of extreme difficulties and second</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.480" end="00:05:00.070" style="s2">it&#39;s another example of the failure to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:03.400" style="s2">sugarcoat things which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.070" end="00:05:04.810" style="s2">things I think makes a mockery of anti</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.400" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">religious theories that are even quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.810" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">sophisticated say like Freud&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:12.190" style="s2">Freud thought of religion as a and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:15.760" style="s2">was a wish fulfillment essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.190" end="00:05:18.610" style="s2">and also Marx who thought about religion</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.760" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">as the opiate of the masses it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">those were true it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">there&#39;d be a lot more wish and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:27.850" style="s2">less reality a lot less stark harsh</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:32.070" style="s2">reality you know in the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.850" end="00:05:35.920" style="s2">Abraham encounters is a famine and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.070" end="00:05:38.470" style="s2">he has to hide his wife and then he he</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:40.540" style="s2">basically journeys into a tyranny so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.470" end="00:05:43.780" style="s2">that&#39;s about as bad as it gets in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.540" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">ways and those themes recur continually</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.780" end="00:05:46.810" style="s2">and no one ever lives where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:49.210" style="s2">supposed to live they&#39;ll even live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.810" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">Canaan and not the promised land and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.210" end="00:05:54.669" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty rough it&#39;s a pretty rough</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">series of stories but the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.669" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">idea is something like there&#39;s no time</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:02.530" style="s2">for sitting around there&#39;s time to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:05.260" style="s2">out into the world and engage and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.530" end="00:06:07.570" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s hints about the proper</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.260" end="00:06:10.660" style="s2">and improper ways of engaging right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.570" end="00:06:12.669" style="s2">clearly the improper way to engage is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.660" end="00:06:16.919" style="s2">think most clearly delineated in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.669" end="00:06:19.780" style="s2">Cain and Abel story and with Cain</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.919" end="00:06:21.760" style="s2">exemplifying the inappropriate way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.780" end="00:06:25.390" style="s2">engage with the world and that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.760" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">engage with the world in a bitter</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.390" end="00:06:30.250" style="s2">jealous and resentful manner now one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:31.960" style="s2">the things that I really like about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">Cain and Abel story and that theme</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.960" end="00:06:35.860" style="s2">recurs continually with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">duality of the brothers right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:40.510" style="s2">there&#39;s constant conflict between a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:42.700" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s essentially like</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.510" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">Cain&#39;s and and the and the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.700" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">perspective which all which I&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:49.300" style="s2">in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:52.669" style="s2">but Caine sees that the world is a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.300" end="00:06:55.040" style="s2">tragic place and that the rewards are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.669" end="00:06:57.169" style="s2">distributed unfairly and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.040" end="00:06:59.600" style="s2">people who do better and people who do</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.169" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">worse and as a consequence of that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.600" end="00:07:05.389" style="s2">becomes bitter and resentful and curses</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">God and then he becomes homicidal</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.389" end="00:07:09.290" style="s2">fratricidal which is even worse than he</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:11.630" style="s2">destroys his own ideal then his</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">can understand why he would have this</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:02.660" style="s2">sorts of things it&#39;s often a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.500" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">to identify what you shouldn&#39;t do than</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.660" end="00:08:07.010" style="s2">what you should do like it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">evil is easier to identify than good I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.010" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">think good is trickier but evil stands</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">out to some degree and then at least you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:15.620" style="s2">can say if you&#39;re trying to get as far</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">away from that as possible we could even</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.620" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">say just for practical reasons so your</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:22.820" style="s2">life doesn&#39;t become hell at least you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.169" end="00:08:25.099" style="s2">could get as far away from that as</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.979" end="00:08:34.729" style="s2">those sorts of pitfalls and I do also</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.080" end="00:08:36.229" style="s2">think that its pitfalls like that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.729" end="00:08:39.409" style="s2">really threaten our society right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.229" end="00:08:42.229" style="s2">you know that I see a tremendous rise in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.409" end="00:08:44.060" style="s2">resentment fueling almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.229" end="00:08:46.279" style="s2">political polarization that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.060" end="00:08:48.680" style="s2">place and seems unfortunate given that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.279" end="00:08:50.390" style="s2">by and by large everyone on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.680" end="00:08:52.580" style="s2">is richer than they&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.390" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.580" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">disparity there&#39;s but there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:58.950" style="s2">disparity anyways Jacob of course Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:02.400" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.950" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">see so and so the and Jacob ends up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.400" end="00:09:10.710" style="s2">with with Isaac&#39;s blessing and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a moral catastrophe and then he</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.710" end="00:09:13.140" style="s2">has to run because his brother wants to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">kill him</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.140" end="00:09:18.270" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the fratricidal motif</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.730" style="s2">again I like that too I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.270" end="00:09:22.620" style="s2">real really realistic you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.730" end="00:09:24.090" style="s2">the things that Freud noted constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:28.020" style="s2">and this is where Freud really is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.090" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">genius is that the most intense hatreds</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.020" end="00:09:33.690" style="s2">and also sometimes the most intense love</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:37.140" style="s2">is within families you know and in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.690" end="00:09:41.310" style="s2">Freudian world of psychopathology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:43.890" style="s2">all it&#39;s all inside the family and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:45.990" style="s2">fact the pathology in the Freudian world</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.890" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">is actually the fact that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.990" end="00:09:49.980" style="s2">inside the family because people who get</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:52.140" style="s2">tangled up in the Freudian familial</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.980" end="00:09:55.080" style="s2">nightmare which is roughly eatable in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.140" end="00:09:56.550" style="s2">structure can only conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.080" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">world in terms of their familial</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.550" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">relationships they&#39;ve been so damaged by</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:02.820" style="s2">the enmeshment and the trauma and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">deceit and the betrayal and the blurred</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.820" end="00:10:08.190" style="s2">lines and all of that that they just</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:11.940" style="s2">can&#39;t expand past the family and go out</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.190" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">in the world so the idea that brothers</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.940" end="00:10:18.120" style="s2">can be at each other&#39;s throats I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.490" end="00:10:19.530" style="s2">is that&#39;s a very powerful idea and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.120" end="00:10:22.860" style="s2">not something that people like to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.530" end="00:10:25.170" style="s2">about so so Jacob has to leave and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.860" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">not surprising because I mean what he</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.170" end="00:10:28.740" style="s2">did was pretty reprehensible he betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">his brother but nonetheless he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.740" end="00:10:35.370" style="s2">person who dreams of the ladder that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:37.290" style="s2">unites heaven and earth and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.370" end="00:10:38.730" style="s2">very perverse thing you know what but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.290" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">one of the things I think it does is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.730" end="00:10:44.190" style="s2">give in some sense it gives hope to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:45.720" style="s2">everyone because it isn&#39;t you know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.190" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">only the good guys win we&#39;re really in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.720" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">trouble right because it&#39;s not that easy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:52.290" style="s2">to be a good guy it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:54.630" style="s2">not that easy and most people are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.290" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">keenly aware of all the ways that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.630" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">fall short even of their own ideals and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:03.510" style="s2">so if there was no hope except for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:06.900" style="s2">good guys almost all of us would be lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.510" end="00:11:08.910" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the things I really</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.900" end="00:11:10.530" style="s2">liked and was more surprised about with</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.910" end="00:11:12.910" style="s2">the Old Testament stories is that these</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.530" end="00:11:16.090" style="s2">people are a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.910" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">and they make very major moral errors by</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.090" end="00:11:22.300" style="s2">anyone&#39;s standard and yet if and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">overall message is still hopeful and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.300" end="00:11:27.160" style="s2">the message that runs contrary to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:29.860" style="s2">message of evil say that message of good</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.160" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">is something like well there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.860" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">emphasis on faith right and the that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:40.450" style="s2">tough one because cynics people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:43.900" style="s2">cynical about religious structures like</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.450" end="00:11:45.880" style="s2">to think of faith as the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.900" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">demolish your intellect in the service</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.880" end="00:11:51.640" style="s2">of superstition and well there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">something to be said for that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.640" end="00:11:57.880" style="s2">perspective but not a lot because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:12:01.030" style="s2">reality is much more sophisticated part</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.880" end="00:12:03.100" style="s2">of the faith that&#39;s that that is being</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.030" end="00:12:05.020" style="s2">insisted upon in the old testament is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.100" end="00:12:08.440" style="s2">something like and I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.020" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">psychologically here again that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.440" end="00:12:13.930" style="s2">useful to pause it a high high good and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">to aim at it so and I really think</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.930" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">that&#39;s practically useful to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:18.760" style="s2">research we&#39;ve done with the Future</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">authoring program for example indicates</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.760" end="00:12:23.290" style="s2">pretty clearly that if you get people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:25.390" style="s2">conceptualize an ideal and a balanced</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.290" end="00:12:26.680" style="s2">ideal you know so what do you want for</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.390" end="00:12:27.910" style="s2">your family what do you want for your</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.680" end="00:12:29.470" style="s2">career what do you want for your</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:31.030" style="s2">education what do you want for your</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.470" end="00:12:35.410" style="s2">character development how are you going</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.030" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">to use your time outside of work how are</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.410" end="00:12:38.650" style="s2">you going to structure your use of drugs</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">and alcohol in places where you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.650" end="00:12:42.970" style="s2">get impulsive how can you avoid falling</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.600" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">into a horrible pit if you really think</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">that through and you come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">integrated ideal and you you put it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:52.750" style="s2">above you as something to reach for</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:55.170" style="s2">then you&#39;re more committed to the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.750" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">in a positive way and you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.170" end="00:13:01.030" style="s2">tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:04.260" style="s2">so and that makes sense right because</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.030" end="00:13:06.790" style="s2">here you are alive and everything and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.260" end="00:13:08.950" style="s2">unless you were capable if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.790" end="00:13:10.840" style="s2">capable of manifesting some positive</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.950" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">relationship with the fact of your being</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.840" end="00:13:16.120" style="s2">then how could that be anything other</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">than hellish because you it would just</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.120" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">be anxiety provoking and terrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:21.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re vulnerable and there&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:24.280" style="s2">nothing useful or worthwhile to do well</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.640" end="00:13:26.290" style="s2">that&#39;s just not I just can&#39;t see that as</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.280" end="00:13:29.529" style="s2">a winning strategy for anyone you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">make a rational case for adopting that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.529" end="00:13:34.060" style="s2">strategy in that you know you can say</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.130" style="s2">well there&#39;s no evidence for for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.060" end="00:13:37.870" style="s2">transcendent morality or for an ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s no hard empirical</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.870" end="00:13:43.899" style="s2">evidence but it seems to me that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:45.310" style="s2">existential evidence as well that has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.899" end="00:13:47.470" style="s2">be taken into account</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.310" end="00:13:50.620" style="s2">and of course psych psychologists have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.470" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">talked about this a lot Carl Rogers for</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.620" end="00:13:53.740" style="s2">example in Hume for that matter Freud</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.540" style="s2">for that matter most of the great</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.740" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">psychologists have pointed out that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.540" end="00:14:00.610" style="s2">know you can derive reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:01.959" style="s2">information that&#39;s that&#39;s solid from</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.610" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">your own experience especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.959" end="00:14:05.470" style="s2">also talk to other people and you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:08.319" style="s2">kind of see in your own life when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.470" end="00:14:10.389" style="s2">on a productive path that sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.319" end="00:14:13.720" style="s2">Nobles and enlightens you or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.389" end="00:14:15.759" style="s2">destructive path and I think it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.720" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">of useful to think that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.759" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">dichotomy between those two paths might</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:24.509" style="s2">be real you know and and because that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:27.610" style="s2">also allows you to give credence to your</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.509" end="00:14:29.110" style="s2">intuitions about that sort of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.610" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t anyways I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.110" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">unreasonable to posit that since you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:36.190" style="s2">alive adopting the highest possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">regard for the fact that you&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.190" end="00:14:40.269" style="s2">and that you&#39;re surrounded by other</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.040" style="s2">creatures that are alive I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.269" end="00:14:44.620" style="s2">see how that can possibly be construed</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.040" end="00:14:45.880" style="s2">as a losing strategy and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.620" end="00:14:48.430" style="s2">first thing so that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.880" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">faith right it&#39;s faith it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.430" end="00:14:52.510" style="s2">only faith in your being but it&#39;s faith</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:55.660" style="s2">in being as such and the faith would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.510" end="00:14:57.940" style="s2">something like if you could orient your</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.660" end="00:15:01.269" style="s2">being properly then maybe that would</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.940" end="00:15:04.410" style="s2">orient you with being as such and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.269" end="00:15:06.579" style="s2">never know like I mean it might be true</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.410" end="00:15:08.889" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to assume that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.579" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be true I mean even if you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.889" end="00:15:12.670" style="s2">take a strict biological perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:14.470" style="s2">this and think about us as the product</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.670" end="00:15:17.860" style="s2">of three and a half billion years of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.470" end="00:15:20.199" style="s2">evolution I mean we have struggled over</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.860" end="00:15:22.930" style="s2">all those billions of years to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.199" end="00:15:25.329" style="s2">and to match ourselves with reality and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.930" end="00:15:27.399" style="s2">so because one of the things I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.329" end="00:15:29.170" style="s2">wondered is you know life is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.399" end="00:15:30.610" style="s2">difficult there&#39;s no doubt about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.170" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s unfair and there&#39;s inequality</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.610" end="00:15:34.209" style="s2">and all of those things and people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">subject to all sorts of terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.209" end="00:15:40.030" style="s2">but I also wonder if you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">actively striving to make things</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.030" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">worse just how much better could they be</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:50.500" style="s2">you know because people are very they</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:52.270" style="s2">like houses that are divided amongst</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.500" end="00:15:53.950" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re pointing in six</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.270" end="00:15:56.260" style="s2">different directions at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.950" end="00:15:57.820" style="s2">they&#39;re working at cross-purposes to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.260" end="00:16:00.660" style="s2">themselves because of bitterness or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.820" end="00:16:03.340" style="s2">began and resentment and on what</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.660" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">unprocessed memories and childhood</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.340" end="00:16:08.980" style="s2">hatreds and unexamined assumptions all</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">sorts of things and you you just gotta</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.980" end="00:16:13.510" style="s2">wonder if you could push that aside and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.470" end="00:16:16.060" style="s2">or int yourself properly and then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.510" end="00:16:17.860" style="s2">other thing that of course is stressed</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.060" end="00:16:19.560" style="s2">very heavily in the Old Testament and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.860" end="00:16:23.530" style="s2">course that goes through the entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.560" end="00:16:25.150" style="s2">biblical corpus is that it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.530" end="00:16:26.950" style="s2">enough to establish a positive</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.150" end="00:16:29.500" style="s2">relationship with being which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.950" end="00:16:31.900" style="s2">the essential it&#39;s a good description of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.500" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">faith you have to make that decision</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.900" end="00:16:36.730" style="s2">right because being is very ambivalent</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:37.870" style="s2">and you can make the case that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.730" end="00:16:38.620" style="s2">it&#39;s something that should have never</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.870" end="00:16:40.870" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.620" end="00:16:43.240" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t seem to be productive</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.870" end="00:16:45.790" style="s2">to me and faith seems to be I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.240" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">act as if being is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.790" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">justifiable and that if I partake in it</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:52.840" style="s2">properly I will improve it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:55.000" style="s2">making it worse so I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.840" end="00:16:57.480" style="s2">statement of faith and then what seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.000" end="00:17:01.540" style="s2">to go along with that is something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.480" end="00:17:04.450" style="s2">truth in conception and action you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.540" end="00:17:06.460" style="s2">even people like Jacob who are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.450" end="00:17:08.920" style="s2">damn morally ambivalent to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.460" end="00:17:10.960" style="s2">get hammered a lot by what they go</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.920" end="00:17:12.430" style="s2">through and what seems to happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.960" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">they&#39;re hammered into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.430" end="00:17:17.620" style="s2">ethical shape right so by the mid point</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:19.990" style="s2">of their life&#39;s journey there are people</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.620" end="00:17:23.310" style="s2">who are solidly planted who you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.990" end="00:17:25.810" style="s2">trust and who don&#39;t betray being or</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.310" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">themselves or their fellow man and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.810" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting I mean it seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:35.920" style="s2">reasonable to me to first assume that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">you have to establish a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.920" end="00:17:39.610" style="s2">with something that&#39;s transcendent it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">might even be just the future version of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.610" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">you but and then second that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:47.050" style="s2">align yourself with reality in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:47.830" style="s2">truthful manner and that that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.050" end="00:17:50.130" style="s2">best bet</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.830" end="00:17:50.130" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.490" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">the biblical stories are actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">realistic about that too because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:18:00.440" style="s2">don&#39;t really say that if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:01.460" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be instantly transported</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.440" end="00:18:03.140" style="s2">to the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.460" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">like even Moses as we&#39;ll find out in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.140" end="00:18:07.910" style="s2">Exodus stories he never makes it to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:11.210" style="s2">Promised Land and so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.910" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">you&#39;re offered instantaneous final</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.210" end="00:18:16.910" style="s2">Redemption if you move out forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:19.880" style="s2">into the world establish a faithful</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.910" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">relationship with being an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.880" end="00:18:24.740" style="s2">conduct yourself with integrity but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.520" end="00:18:26.780" style="s2">your best bet and it might be good</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.740" end="00:18:29.270" style="s2">enough and even if it&#39;s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.780" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">it&#39;s really preferable to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.270" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">alternative which seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.220" end="00:18:41.540" style="s2">closely akin to hell both personal and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:44.450" style="s2">social so Joseph&#39;s father is Jacob later</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:46.250" style="s2">Israel he who wrestles with God and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.450" end="00:18:48.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.250" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of implicit and what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.380" end="00:18:53.750" style="s2">saying is that I think we all do that to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.360" end="00:18:56.390" style="s2">some degree we wrestle with reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.750" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">itself that&#39;s for sure not only the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.390" end="00:18:59.780" style="s2">reality we understand but the reality we</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:01.540" style="s2">don&#39;t understand which is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.780" end="00:19:04.040" style="s2">transcendent reality and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.540" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">whatever reality is outside of that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.040" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">know because the classic judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:10.190" style="s2">conception of God is that there&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">and space and of course there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.190" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">things about what exists in time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:16.280" style="s2">space that we&#39;re completely ignorant of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s transcendent in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.280" end="00:19:21.080" style="s2">but then there&#39;s an idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.020" end="00:19:22.460" style="s2">realm outside of that which is a well</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.080" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting idea it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.460" end="00:19:28.010" style="s2">sophisticated idea I think rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:30.530" style="s2">simple idea it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to know</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.010" end="00:19:33.410" style="s2">what to make of it but it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.530" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">matter because I think regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.410" end="00:19:38.600" style="s2">what your attitude is towards those</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:41.960" style="s2">sorts of things intellectually you still</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.600" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">end up in the same position as Jacob for</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">all intents and purposes practically</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:47.420" style="s2">speaking because I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:49.070" style="s2">there&#39;s anyone who at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.420" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">their life or perhaps even everyday</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.070" end="00:19:53.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t at some level wrestle with God</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">and you could just call it well the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.900" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">nature of reality I suppose if you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:20:00.350" style="s2">to be say reductionistic about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:02.540" style="s2">don&#39;t think it makes any difference it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.350" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">still something you&#39;re stuck with and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.540" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not only the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:07.790" style="s2">itself that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:09.560" style="s2">have to struggle with but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.790" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">nature of your moral relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.560" end="00:20:13.040" style="s2">your behavioral relationship to it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">that&#39;s how you should perceive it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.040" end="00:20:18.380" style="s2">how you should conduct yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:20.510" style="s2">whether or not the the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.380" end="00:20:23.030" style="s2">doing it properly are worth the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.510" end="00:20:24.860" style="s2">difficulty and the disadvantages so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.030" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">seems to me just a straight existential</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.860" end="00:20:29.780" style="s2">statement then you know Jacob gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:34.520" style="s2">damaged by his wrestling which is also</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.780" end="00:20:36.050" style="s2">very realistic so anyways he also ends</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.520" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">up his father of Joseph who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.050" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">favorite son son who&#39;s born in his old</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:42.980" style="s2">age to his favorite wife and that&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:47.810" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk about to you today so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.980" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">you remember so Jacob is the forefather</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.810" end="00:20:53.690" style="s2">of the twelve tribes of Israel and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:56.390" style="s2">there&#39;s his his wives and this son and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.690" end="00:20:58.040" style="s2">the offspring that resulted those are</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.390" end="00:21:00.800" style="s2">all the sons there&#39;s a daughter named</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.040" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">Dinah as well and rachel is the woman he</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.800" end="00:21:05.090" style="s2">really loved and the first son he had</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">with Rachel was Joseph and that was when</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:12.560" style="s2">he was older and so that&#39;s in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:15.110" style="s2">why Joseph is his favorite so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.560" end="00:21:17.420" style="s2">the beginning of the story of Joseph now</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.110" end="00:21:18.980" style="s2">Israel Jacob loved Joseph more than all</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.420" end="00:21:20.420" style="s2">his children because he was the son of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.980" end="00:21:23.270" style="s2">his old age and he made him a coat of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.420" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">many colors and there&#39;s a lot packed</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.270" end="00:21:28.340" style="s2">into those two sentences you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">first is that now Israel loved Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.340" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">more than all his other children that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:35.090" style="s2">probably not so good one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:37.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in the stories that have</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.090" end="00:21:39.890" style="s2">preceded this is that whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.250" end="00:21:42.800" style="s2">marked preference on the part of parents</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.890" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">for one child over the other and in with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.800" end="00:21:50.120" style="s2">with with with Jacob and Esau it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.220" end="00:21:56.460" style="s2">Rachel was Jacob was Rachel&#39;s favorite</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.120" end="00:21:58.620" style="s2">and ISA was Isaac&#39;s fav</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.460" end="00:22:00.390" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work out so well that put a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.620" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">real twist in the entire structure of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.390" end="00:22:05.190" style="s2">the family and so there&#39;s a warning</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:06.750" style="s2">there right off the bat you might say</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.190" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">well you can&#39;t help having a preference</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.750" end="00:22:10.500" style="s2">for one child or for another but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:11.610" style="s2">know if that&#39;s true and it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.500" end="00:22:13.140" style="s2">something that you should be very</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.610" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">cautious about because it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.140" end="00:22:17.460" style="s2">to work out very well because he was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:20.280" style="s2">son of his old age fair enough and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.460" end="00:22:22.110" style="s2">made him a coat of many colors that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.280" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">very interesting image that coat of many</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.110" end="00:22:27.750" style="s2">colors that that idea and so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.880" style="s2">delve into that idea because it sets the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.750" end="00:22:32.670" style="s2">stage like it says what sort of person</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.880" end="00:22:34.830" style="s2">Joseph is he&#39;s favored he&#39;s younger he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.670" end="00:22:37.500" style="s2">favored but he also has this particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.830" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">garment that characterizes him you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.500" end="00:22:41.430" style="s2">and one of the things I&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:43.950" style="s2">learned from analyzing women&#39;s dreams in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.430" end="00:22:45.870" style="s2">particular is that women very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.950" end="00:22:48.660" style="s2">in my experience very frequently dream</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:50.850" style="s2">of clothing as a role and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.660" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">interpreting women&#39;s dreams then if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.850" end="00:22:55.650" style="s2">put on the shoes of their grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:58.260" style="s2">for example then you understand very</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.650" end="00:22:59.670" style="s2">rapidly that the dream is trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.260" end="00:23:00.750" style="s2">an association between their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.670" end="00:23:03.240" style="s2">behavior and something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.750" end="00:23:04.680" style="s2">characteristic of either the state of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.240" end="00:23:07.020" style="s2">being a grandmother or the particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.680" end="00:23:09.630" style="s2">grandmother and it makes sense right</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.020" end="00:23:13.920" style="s2">because clothing protects but it also</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.630" end="00:23:16.050" style="s2">signifies a role and it&#39;s interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.920" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">in the Old Testament stories often if</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.050" end="00:23:20.370" style="s2">someone is going to act deceitfully they</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.720" style="s2">change their they change their outfit</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.370" end="00:23:24.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.720" end="00:23:26.100" style="s2">act deceitfully right you dress up like</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.120" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">someone else you present yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.100" end="00:23:35.820" style="s2">someone else so anyways back to the coat</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:39.390" style="s2">of many colors well for something to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.820" end="00:23:41.820" style="s2">many colored it sort of spans the entire</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.390" end="00:23:43.700" style="s2">gamut of possibility and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.820" end="00:23:49.190" style="s2">hint there that if you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.700" end="00:23:52.020" style="s2">full-fledged person that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.190" end="00:23:54.900" style="s2">manifest a very large number of traits</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.020" end="00:23:56.430" style="s2">and so I want to go into that idea a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.900" end="00:23:58.260" style="s2">the first thing I want to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.430" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">some of the things that we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.260" end="00:24:03.300" style="s2">about what happens to you when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:06.570" style="s2">a new environment now there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.300" end="00:24:09.240" style="s2">in very deep idea in clinical psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.570" end="00:24:09.870" style="s2">a fundamental idea which is that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.240" end="00:24:11.550" style="s2">someone&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.870" end="00:24:15.180" style="s2">just about something what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.550" end="00:24:16.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s getting in their way you take</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.180" end="00:24:18.510" style="s2">what they&#39;re anxious about and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.380" end="00:24:19.890" style="s2">define it because that already delimits</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.510" end="00:24:21.240" style="s2">it right because one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.890" end="00:24:22.530" style="s2">with being anxious about something is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.240" end="00:24:24.420" style="s2">you won&#39;t speak of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.530" end="00:24:26.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like Voldemort and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.420" end="00:24:27.900" style="s2">don&#39;t speak of it you it&#39;s way bigger</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.340" end="00:24:29.430" style="s2">than it should be as soon as you start</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.900" end="00:24:32.309" style="s2">talking about it you cut it down to size</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.430" end="00:24:33.390" style="s2">and so and it it&#39;s for a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.309" end="00:24:35.370" style="s2">reasons it&#39;s because you&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:37.920" style="s2">afraid you&#39;re not as afraid of as many</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.370" end="00:24:40.770" style="s2">things as you think and you&#39;re braver</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.920" end="00:24:42.570" style="s2">than you know and more and more capable</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.770" end="00:24:44.010" style="s2">so as soon as you&#39;re brave enough to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.570" end="00:24:45.900" style="s2">start talking about what you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.010" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">of then you see that there&#39;s more to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.900" end="00:24:50.130" style="s2">than you thought and that there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">to the problem than you thought and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.130" end="00:24:53.370" style="s2">you can decompose it further into</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">smaller problems and then you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.370" end="00:24:57.390" style="s2">out how to approach those smaller</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:59.730" style="s2">problems and so and then it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.390" end="00:25:01.050" style="s2">to me to be that you get less frightened</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.730" end="00:25:02.790" style="s2">it seems to be that you get more</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.050" end="00:25:04.110" style="s2">courageous which is way better than</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.790" end="00:25:05.610" style="s2">being less frightened because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.110" end="00:25:07.380" style="s2">lots of things to be frightened about so</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.610" end="00:25:09.570" style="s2">if you&#39;re courageous that that really</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.380" end="00:25:12.120" style="s2">does the trick now the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.570" end="00:25:15.480" style="s2">happens if you like let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.120" end="00:25:17.010" style="s2">you&#39;re very socially inept and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.480" end="00:25:19.620" style="s2">know how to introduce yourself or to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.010" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">make any establish the initial parts of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.620" end="00:25:23.370" style="s2">a relationship with anyone and so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.309" style="s2">you start putting yourself in situations</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.370" end="00:25:28.170" style="s2">where you&#39;re required to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.309" end="00:25:31.290" style="s2">then the question is how is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.170" end="00:25:33.510" style="s2">technically that you transform you say</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.290" end="00:25:35.190" style="s2">well you learn well we want to be more</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.510" end="00:25:37.260" style="s2">specific about that what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.190" end="00:25:39.000" style="s2">that you learned well if you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.260" end="00:25:41.160" style="s2">with someone who&#39;s particularly socially</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.000" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">inept and you&#39;re doing psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.160" end="00:25:44.820" style="s2">with them you might teach them how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:46.290" style="s2">shake someone&#39;s hand properly and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.820" end="00:25:48.390" style="s2">their name and remember the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.290" end="00:25:49.830" style="s2">person&#39;s name and so you just practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.390" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">that with them so that they have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.830" end="00:25:54.630" style="s2">motoric routine down so that form of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:56.760" style="s2">knowledge is built right into your body</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.630" end="00:25:59.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like look at the person put out</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.760" end="00:26:02.309" style="s2">your hand shake it don&#39;t not like a dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.670" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">halibut but you know with a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.309" end="00:26:06.780" style="s2">grip say your name don&#39;t mumble it look</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:08.580" style="s2">look at them so that they can hear you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.780" end="00:26:11.130" style="s2">and then when they say their name try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.580" end="00:26:12.750" style="s2">remember it and that&#39;s then so you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.130" end="00:26:14.670" style="s2">practice that with people and so then</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.750" end="00:26:16.200" style="s2">they develop something that&#39;s motoric</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.670" end="00:26:19.770" style="s2">right it&#39;s embedded right in their body</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.200" end="00:26:21.150" style="s2">and so and then you can say to them well</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.770" end="00:26:23.090" style="s2">the other thing you can do is when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.150" end="00:26:24.679" style="s2">start a conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.090" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t sit there thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.679" end="00:26:28.490" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna say next because then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:29.720" style="s2">won&#39;t be paying attention to the person</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.490" end="00:26:34.039" style="s2">and you&#39;ll make a fool out of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.720" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">because you&#39;ll manifest non sequiturs</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.039" end="00:26:37.399" style="s2">right because you&#39;ll get out it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.870" end="00:26:39.379" style="s2">if you&#39;re dancing and all you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.399" end="00:26:40.999" style="s2">attention to is where your feet are and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.379" end="00:26:41.990" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna step on the other person</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.999" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">all the time so you want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.990" end="00:26:46.639" style="s2">attention to the other person and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.970" end="00:26:48.649" style="s2">whatever automatized social knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.639" end="00:26:49.909" style="s2">you have will come to the forefront so</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.649" end="00:26:51.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing to know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.909" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">socially anxious right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.620" end="00:26:55.399" style="s2">socially anxious one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.590" style="s2">should do is pay way more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.399" end="00:26:59.240" style="s2">the person you&#39;re talking to rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.590" end="00:27:01.730" style="s2">less and you should pay as little</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.240" end="00:27:03.409" style="s2">attention as possible to yourself so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.730" end="00:27:05.119" style="s2">you feel yourself falling in because</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.409" end="00:27:06.649" style="s2">you&#39;re anxious then what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.119" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">push your attention out and pay</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.649" end="00:27:09.860" style="s2">attention to the person because to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.779" style="s2">degree that you&#39;ve been socialized then</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.860" end="00:27:14.330" style="s2">all your automatic responses will kick</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.779" end="00:27:16.279" style="s2">in so but anyway so you go out into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">social world and you learn to shake</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.279" end="00:27:19.879" style="s2">someone&#39;s hand and you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.769" style="s2">listen to them and ask them questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.879" end="00:27:23.899" style="s2">because that&#39;s the next thing because</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.769" end="00:27:26.179" style="s2">people love you can&#39;t just ask them</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.899" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">random questions obviously but if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.179" end="00:27:29.659" style="s2">start talking to you and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:31.249" style="s2">understand something about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.659" end="00:27:32.600" style="s2">saying or maybe something they said is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.249" end="00:27:34.580" style="s2">interesting and you ask them a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.600" end="00:27:35.929" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty damn happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.580" end="00:27:37.549" style="s2">because it means you&#39;re actually paying</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.929" end="00:27:39.980" style="s2">attention to them and people actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.549" end="00:27:42.409" style="s2">love to be paid attention to because it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.980" end="00:27:45.230" style="s2">hardly ever happens so they really</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.409" end="00:27:47.299" style="s2">really like it and so okay so so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.230" end="00:27:50.600" style="s2">happening well first of all your</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.299" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">mastering them automated motor movements</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.600" end="00:27:54.710" style="s2">right where to point your eyes where to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">put your hands how to move your lips</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.710" end="00:27:59.059" style="s2">like really embodied knowledge it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:01.340" style="s2">special kind of memory and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.059" end="00:28:04.759" style="s2">practicing them so that&#39;s building new</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.340" end="00:28:06.049" style="s2">skills for you and then by listening to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.759" end="00:28:10.309" style="s2">the person and watching yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.049" end="00:28:12.409" style="s2">interact you&#39;re also generating new new</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.309" end="00:28:13.999" style="s2">abstract information that enables you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.409" end="00:28:16.789" style="s2">conceptualize the world in a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.999" end="00:28:19.129" style="s2">way so if you go out to ten you go out</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.789" end="00:28:21.619" style="s2">and talk to ten different people or 50</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.129" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">different people then you get to listen</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.619" end="00:28:25.669" style="s2">to what those 50 people said you get to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:28.249" style="s2">watch how they&#39;re how they express</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.669" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">themselves and you gather a corpus of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.249" end="00:28:31.909" style="s2">knowledge that changes the way you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:34.250" style="s2">perceive that broadens you as a social</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.909" end="00:28:35.720" style="s2">agent okay so that&#39;s two forms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.250" end="00:28:36.330" style="s2">knowledge but then there&#39;s a third one</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.720" end="00:28:38.670" style="s2">which is real</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.330" end="00:28:41.640" style="s2">interesting which is that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.670" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">have a lot of biological potential and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.640" end="00:28:46.050" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to know what potential is but</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.740" end="00:28:49.140" style="s2">part of it is that you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.050" end="00:28:50.730" style="s2">generating proteins that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.140" end="00:28:53.490" style="s2">been generating so you should get right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.730" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">on that by the way so but what the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.490" end="00:28:57.030" style="s2">that works in part is that if you put</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:00.600" style="s2">yourself in a radically new situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.030" end="00:29:02.940" style="s2">then your brain that there are genetic</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.600" end="00:29:05.190" style="s2">switches that turn on because of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.940" end="00:29:08.810" style="s2">demands of the new situation that code</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.190" end="00:29:11.400" style="s2">for new proteins so it&#39;s as if you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.810" end="00:29:13.500" style="s2">latent software that would be one way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.400" end="00:29:15.630" style="s2">thinking about that will only be turned</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">on if you go into the situation where</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.630" end="00:29:20.190" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary and so then you might</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">think well if that&#39;s the case how much</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.190" end="00:29:23.670" style="s2">of you could be turned on if you went a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:26.040" style="s2">whole bunch of different places and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.670" end="00:29:29.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a really really that&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.040" end="00:29:32.070" style="s2">question because one of the deep answers</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.490" end="00:29:35.250" style="s2">to how you should get your life together</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.070" end="00:29:40.020" style="s2">is you should go a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.250" end="00:29:41.190" style="s2">places and turn yourself on and I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.020" end="00:29:43.620" style="s2">to walk through that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.190" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2">because there&#39;s a very rich symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.620" end="00:29:50.820" style="s2">world that expresses that so now the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.150" end="00:29:54.660" style="s2">idea about having a coat of many colors</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.820" end="00:29:57.210" style="s2">would be that the person who is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.660" end="00:29:58.890" style="s2">appropriate leader because remember or</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.210" end="00:30:00.840" style="s2">the proper person which would be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.890" end="00:30:03.810" style="s2">same thing one of the things that these</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.840" end="00:30:05.730" style="s2">old stories are trying to express and to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.810" end="00:30:07.980" style="s2">figure out is how is it that you should</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.730" end="00:30:10.490" style="s2">act which is the same as what</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.980" end="00:30:13.260" style="s2">constitutes the ideal those are the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:15.060" style="s2">question and the hand here with Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.260" end="00:30:16.620" style="s2">is well you should wear a coat of many</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.060" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">colors which means that you should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.620" end="00:30:21.450" style="s2">able to go have a drink in the pub with</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">the guys who are you know drywalling</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.450" end="00:30:25.080" style="s2">your your house and you should be able</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">to have a sophisticated conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.080" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">with someone who&#39;s more educated in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">abstract way and that maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">be equally comfortable in both</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:36.690" style="s2">situations right because you might think</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:38.550" style="s2">well there&#39;s more one of the indications</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.690" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s more to you is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.550" end="00:30:44.070" style="s2">be put more places and function properly</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:47.280" style="s2">and that would be a good thing to aim at</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.070" end="00:30:50.160" style="s2">because here&#39;s the other issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.280" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">you know perfectly well that the fun</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.160" end="00:30:54.870" style="s2">the mental tragedies of life and your</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:56.280" style="s2">exposure to malevolence in the course of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.870" end="00:30:58.860" style="s2">that life so those being the worst</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.280" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">things there&#39;s not a lot you can do to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.860" end="00:31:03.480" style="s2">to alter that fundamentally because</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.220" style="s2">their conditions of existence you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.480" end="00:31:06.660" style="s2">going to be subject to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.220" end="00:31:09.420" style="s2">vulnerability and you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.660" end="00:31:11.340" style="s2">subject to malevolence that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.420" end="00:31:13.410" style="s2">you can&#39;t hide from it because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.340" end="00:31:15.630" style="s2">actually makes it worse so you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.410" end="00:31:17.250" style="s2">with it so then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.630" end="00:31:19.260" style="s2">what are your options and one option is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.250" end="00:31:21.510" style="s2">to curse the structure of being for</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.260" end="00:31:23.370" style="s2">being malevolent and tragic and fair</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.510" end="00:31:27.470" style="s2">enough and now there is to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:31.770" style="s2">so damn differentiated and dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.470" end="00:31:34.230" style="s2">able that you&#39;re more than a match for</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.770" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">that now that&#39;s not an easy thing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.230" end="00:31:37.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because like what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:39.450" style="s2">the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.260" end="00:31:45.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no good alternative and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.450" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">also worth knowing so you see these</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.750" end="00:31:50.430" style="s2">ideas expressed in the strangest places</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:53.220" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve talked a little bit I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.430" end="00:31:55.400" style="s2">in this video series about Pinocchio but</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.220" end="00:31:58.200" style="s2">if we haven&#39;t it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.400" end="00:32:03.000" style="s2">you see there&#39;s Jiminy Cricket at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.200" end="00:32:05.160" style="s2">opening of the Pinocchio movie pointing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.000" end="00:32:06.900" style="s2">to a star which is roughly the nativity</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.160" end="00:32:10.940" style="s2">star for all intents and purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.900" end="00:32:14.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a symbolic indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.940" end="00:32:17.040" style="s2">something Dimond like and pure right</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.520" end="00:32:19.620" style="s2">glimmering in the darkness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.040" end="00:32:22.560" style="s2">transcendent and above the horizon upon</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.620" end="00:32:24.300" style="s2">which to fix your eyes and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.560" end="00:32:27.660" style="s2">thing is you need that technically and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.300" end="00:32:29.520" style="s2">the reason you need that is because we</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.660" end="00:32:31.290" style="s2">know enough about psychology now to know</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.520" end="00:32:32.580" style="s2">that almost all of the positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.290" end="00:32:35.040" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to experience in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.580" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">life and positive emotion is analgesic</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.040" end="00:32:38.790" style="s2">by the way right it actually quells pain</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just positive it also gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.790" end="00:32:42.990" style="s2">rid of negative which is a big plus</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.850" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">almost all the positive emotion that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.990" end="00:32:47.430" style="s2">you&#39;re going to feel you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:49.560" style="s2">feel in relationship to a goal because</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.430" end="00:32:51.900" style="s2">you feel positive emotion as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.560" end="00:32:53.520" style="s2">approach a goal and so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.900" end="00:32:55.230" style="s2">feel positive emotion then you need a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.520" end="00:32:57.060" style="s2">goal and then you might think well if</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:32:59.310" style="s2">you want to maximize that positive</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.060" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">emotion which is enthusiasm and also</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.310" end="00:33:03.720" style="s2">what pulls you out into the world as</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">well as feeling good then you need the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.720" end="00:33:11.880" style="s2">possible goal well not because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:13.470" style="s2">gonna engage the largest segments of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.880" end="00:33:15.059" style="s2">your being like if your goal is too</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.470" end="00:33:17.280" style="s2">narrow then a bunch of you isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.059" end="00:33:19.830" style="s2">be on board for it you know if the goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.280" end="00:33:21.780" style="s2">is well-developed and multifaceted then</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.830" end="00:33:23.429" style="s2">all of you can partake in that even your</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.780" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">negative elements even your anger and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.429" end="00:33:28.409" style="s2">and your fear can get on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:30.900" style="s2">let&#39;s say so you need a goal man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.409" end="00:33:32.760" style="s2">worthy you&#39;ve got us thank you good you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.900" end="00:33:35.280" style="s2">need a goal that justifies the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.760" end="00:33:37.830" style="s2">and malevolence of life that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.280" end="00:33:39.299" style="s2">the bottom line now maybe you think well</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.830" end="00:33:44.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no goal that can do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.299" end="00:33:47.850" style="s2">like well there are still better and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.820" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">worse goals so and I&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.850" end="00:33:52.620" style="s2">that there are no goals that can do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:54.570" style="s2">I think that&#39;s an open question you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.620" end="00:33:56.730" style="s2">never know that until you pursued the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.570" end="00:33:59.400" style="s2">proper goal long enough to find out who</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:01.710" style="s2">you would be as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.400" end="00:34:03.570" style="s2">pursuing it so that&#39;s also your destiny</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.710" end="00:34:05.159" style="s2">or your existential voyage right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.570" end="00:34:07.860" style="s2">also not something that anyone else can</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.159" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">do for you someone can say get your act</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.860" end="00:34:12.899" style="s2">together for Christ&#39;s sake and get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:15.659" style="s2">get get at it that&#39;s that&#39;ll make the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.899" end="00:34:17.990" style="s2">world unfold best for you but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.659" end="00:34:22.050" style="s2">way you can know that without doing it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.990" end="00:34:24.149" style="s2">so and unless you think you&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.050" end="00:34:26.520" style="s2">particularly stellar job of that then</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.149" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">you have no reason to doubt its</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.520" end="00:34:33.750" style="s2">potential validity so plus like crickets</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:36.570" style="s2">are telling you this and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.750" end="00:34:39.060" style="s2">they&#39;re a very reliable source okay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.570" end="00:34:41.609" style="s2">you see the star the star recurs as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.060" end="00:34:43.530" style="s2">motif in Pinocchio and one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.609" end="00:34:46.020" style="s2">interesting elements of it here is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.530" end="00:34:48.510" style="s2">when Geppetto wants to transform his</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.020" end="00:34:51.599" style="s2">puppet the marionette who&#39;s being played</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.510" end="00:34:53.790" style="s2">by forces that operate behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.599" end="00:34:55.980" style="s2">which is a really good definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.790" end="00:34:58.140" style="s2">persona from a union perspective right</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.980" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">and also something indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.140" end="00:35:03.060" style="s2">something like an ideological or</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">conceptual possession Geppetto who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.060" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">good guy is positive father figure Reid</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:11.010" style="s2">lifts his even though he&#39;s a patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">figure right and a very competent one he</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:14.820" style="s2">still even lifts his eyes up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:17.369" style="s2">something that transcends his mode of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.820" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">being positive as it is and wishes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.369" end="00:35:21.600" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:23.130" style="s2">creation would undertake the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.600" end="00:35:26.070" style="s2">transformation that would make it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.130" end="00:35:28.680" style="s2">autonomous and fully functional as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.070" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">moral agent no strings right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.680" end="00:35:33.840" style="s2">very interesting I think Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:36.890" style="s2">said the salvation of mankind lies only</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.840" end="00:35:40.410" style="s2">in making everything the concern of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.890" end="00:35:43.859" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty decent star-like goal I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.410" end="00:35:46.050" style="s2">would say and so what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.859" end="00:35:48.359" style="s2">Pinocchio story is that because and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.050" end="00:35:49.890" style="s2">think this is a symbolic representative</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.359" end="00:35:51.690" style="s2">of what I just described you that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.890" end="00:35:55.290" style="s2">happens at a genetic level if you put</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.690" end="00:35:57.240" style="s2">yourself in new situations so Geppetto</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.290" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">is roughly culture in the Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.240" end="00:36:03.690" style="s2">story right he&#39;s he&#39;s a craftsman he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">he&#39;s a and and he makes Pinocchio so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.690" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s who&#39;s his son he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">socializing agent and he aims for</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:16.740" style="s2">something above mere socialization which</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:18.359" style="s2">is I think part of the mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.740" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">element of human beings you know in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.359" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">scientific models we basically have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.180" style="s2">socialization and biology but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:26.970" style="s2">always a third element in mythological</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.180" end="00:36:29.490" style="s2">stories which is whatever you might</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.970" end="00:36:31.470" style="s2">construe as the spontaneous action of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.490" end="00:36:33.540" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.470" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">freewill and you know that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.540" end="00:36:36.900" style="s2">basically being conceptualized in</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:39.090" style="s2">religious terms as something akin to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.900" end="00:36:41.790" style="s2">soul now we don&#39;t have a category for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.090" end="00:36:43.109" style="s2">that scientifically because what we try</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.790" end="00:36:45.510" style="s2">to do scientifically is to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.109" end="00:36:48.869" style="s2">everything either to socialization or to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.510" end="00:36:51.540" style="s2">biology but it isn&#39;t clear to me that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.869" end="00:36:53.460" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s perfectly reasonable from</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.540" end="00:36:55.350" style="s2">the perspective of practicality at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.460" end="00:36:57.480" style="s2">scientific level you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.350" end="00:36:59.340" style="s2">multiply explanatory principles beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.480" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">necessity but there&#39;s many things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.340" end="00:37:03.030" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t come to terms with such as</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:05.490" style="s2">the fact that we all treat each other as</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.030" end="00:37:07.170" style="s2">autonomous beings with freewill and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.490" end="00:37:08.760" style="s2">that seems to work and that if we stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.170" end="00:37:11.730" style="s2">doing that then things go to hell very</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.760" end="00:37:13.770" style="s2">very rapidly so and the mere fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.730" end="00:37:16.460" style="s2">we have been able to conceptualize what</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.770" end="00:37:18.270" style="s2">that conscious freewill might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.460" end="00:37:20.040" style="s2">metaphysically or physically doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.270" end="00:37:22.859" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t exist it just means that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.040" end="00:37:24.510" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand it I mean what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.859" end="00:37:26.340" style="s2">was only in the last 15 years that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.510" end="00:37:27.930" style="s2">discovered that 95 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.340" end="00:37:30.270" style="s2">universe was made out of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.930" end="00:37:32.330" style="s2">matter that we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.270" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">whose properties we can&#39;t even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.330" end="00:37:38.550" style="s2">except that it seems to have mass so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.260" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">anyways what happens is when Geppetto</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.550" end="00:37:45.540" style="s2">reach lifts his eyes up to the star he</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:48.030" style="s2">so it&#39;s society aligning itself with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.540" end="00:37:51.390" style="s2">proper goal with regards to individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.030" end="00:37:52.860" style="s2">development right so so the instead of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.390" end="00:37:54.780" style="s2">society being at odds with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.860" end="00:37:56.790" style="s2">individual they line up and then what</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.780" end="00:37:58.619" style="s2">happens is nature comes onboard and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.790" end="00:38:00.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the blue fairy in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.619" end="00:38:02.460" style="s2">Pinocchio story and that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.630" end="00:38:05.820" style="s2">be a symbolic representation of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.460" end="00:38:08.190" style="s2">happens biologically when when you set</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.820" end="00:38:09.600" style="s2">the goal properly get your culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.190" end="00:38:12.840" style="s2">behind you and move into the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.600" end="00:38:14.250" style="s2">that there&#39;s a biological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.840" end="00:38:15.750" style="s2">that occurs as a consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.250" end="00:38:19.470" style="s2">which means that a bunch of you that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.750" end="00:38:21.600" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been turned on turns on and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.470" end="00:38:23.100" style="s2">guess one question would be is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.600" end="00:38:24.810" style="s2">would you be like if you turned on</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.100" end="00:38:27.750" style="s2">everything inside of you that could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.810" end="00:38:33.330" style="s2">turned on well that&#39;s a good goal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.750" end="00:38:34.380" style="s2">a good thing to find out so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.330" end="00:38:37.830" style="s2">going to introduce a couple of other</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.380" end="00:38:39.869" style="s2">ideas so there&#39;s this idea in union</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.830" end="00:38:42.750" style="s2">psychology called the circumambulation</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.869" end="00:38:45.060" style="s2">and you only had this idea that you had</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.750" end="00:38:47.700" style="s2">a potential future self which would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.060" end="00:38:50.580" style="s2">in potential everything that you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.700" end="00:38:53.700" style="s2">be and that it manifests itself moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.580" end="00:38:56.100" style="s2">to moment in your present life by making</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.700" end="00:38:57.840" style="s2">you interested in things and the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.100" end="00:38:59.730" style="s2">that you&#39;re interested in are the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.840" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">that would guide you along the path that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.730" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">would lead you to maximal development</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">now it sounds of like a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:10.680" style="s2">idea or a or a mystical idea even but</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.770" end="00:39:12.780" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.680" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">profoundly biological idea the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.780" end="00:39:16.950" style="s2">something like well you&#39;re set up so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:19.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re automatically interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.950" end="00:39:22.220" style="s2">those things that was fully expand you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.560" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">as a well adapted creature well like</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.220" end="00:39:27.270" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing radical about that idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:28.770" style="s2">how else what else could possibly be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.270" end="00:39:31.470" style="s2">case unless there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.770" end="00:39:33.690" style="s2">fundamentally flawed about you that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.470" end="00:39:35.070" style="s2">what the the situation would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.690" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">kind of interesting to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.070" end="00:39:39.450" style="s2">that would be manifest moment to moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:40.980" style="s2">but the idea is something like well your</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.450" end="00:39:43.050" style="s2">interest is captured by those things</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.980" end="00:39:44.130" style="s2">that lead you down the path of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.050" end="00:39:46.200" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.130" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">well that better be the case okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.200" end="00:39:50.100" style="s2">that&#39;s fine and so there&#39;s some utility</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.570" style="s2">in pursuing those things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.100" end="00:39:54.930" style="s2">interested in that&#39;s the call to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.570" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2">adventure let&#39;s say so and the call to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.930" end="00:39:57.870" style="s2">adventure takes you all sorts of places</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.520" end="00:39:59.340" style="s2">now the problem with the call to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.870" end="00:40:01.710" style="s2">adventure is like what the hell do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.340" end="00:40:03.950" style="s2">know you might be interested in things</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.710" end="00:40:07.260" style="s2">that are kind of warped and bent and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.950" end="00:40:09.870" style="s2">often it&#39;s the case that when new parts</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.260" end="00:40:12.360" style="s2">of people manifest themselves and grip</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.870" end="00:40:15.360" style="s2">their interest say they do it very badly</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.360" end="00:40:16.590" style="s2">and shoddily and so you stumble around</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.360" end="00:40:18.510" style="s2">like an idiot when you try to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.590" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">something new that&#39;s where the fool is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.510" end="00:40:22.500" style="s2">the precursor to the savior from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.270" style="s2">from the symbolic perspectives because</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.500" end="00:40:25.770" style="s2">you have to be a fool before you can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.270" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">a master and if you&#39;re not willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.770" end="00:40:31.830" style="s2">a fool then you can&#39;t be a master so so</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:33.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna it&#39;s it&#39;s an error mmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.830" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2">error ridden process and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.960" end="00:40:36.930" style="s2">laid out in the Old Testament stories</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:39.390" style="s2">because the first thing that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:40.950" style="s2">all these patriarchal figures when God</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.390" end="00:40:44.280" style="s2">kicks them out of their father&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.950" end="00:40:46.380" style="s2">when they&#39;re like 84 is that they they</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.280" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">run into all sorts of trouble and some</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.380" end="00:40:49.350" style="s2">of its social and some of its natural</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2">and some of it&#39;s a consequence of their</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.350" end="00:40:54.750" style="s2">own moral inadequacy so they&#39;re fools</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:56.280" style="s2">and but but the thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.750" end="00:40:57.570" style="s2">interesting is that despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.280" end="00:41:00.030" style="s2">that they&#39;re fools they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.570" end="00:41:02.220" style="s2">supposed to go on the adventure and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.030" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">they&#39;re capable of learning enough as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.220" end="00:41:05.490" style="s2">consequence of moving forward on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:08.190" style="s2">adventure so that they straighten</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.490" end="00:41:09.230" style="s2">themselves out across time and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.190" end="00:41:11.160" style="s2">something like this so this</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.230" end="00:41:14.190" style="s2">circumambulation that young talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.160" end="00:41:16.710" style="s2">was this continual will return to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.190" end="00:41:19.170" style="s2">this continual circling in some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.710" end="00:41:20.580" style="s2">who you could be you might notice for</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.170" end="00:41:22.080" style="s2">example that there are themes in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.580" end="00:41:24.360" style="s2">life you know when you go back across</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.080" end="00:41:26.010" style="s2">your experiences you see you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.360" end="00:41:28.500" style="s2">have your typical experience that sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.010" end="00:41:30.930" style="s2">of repeats itself and there might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.500" end="00:41:33.720" style="s2">variation on it like a musical theme but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.930" end="00:41:35.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like you&#39;re circling yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.720" end="00:41:37.050" style="s2">and getting closer to yourself as you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.820" end="00:41:39.060" style="s2">move across time</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.050" end="00:41:40.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the circumambulation now you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.060" end="00:41:42.090" style="s2">remember that for a second as well go</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.380" end="00:41:44.370" style="s2">back to it okay so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.090" end="00:41:47.070" style="s2">something glimmers before you it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.370" end="00:41:49.020" style="s2">interest that&#39;s dawning and you decide</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.070" end="00:41:50.310" style="s2">well first of all you&#39;re paralyzed you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.020" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">think well how do I know if I should</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.310" end="00:41:54.570" style="s2">pursue that it&#39;s probably a stupid idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:56.280" style="s2">and the proper response to that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.570" end="00:41:57.839" style="s2">you&#39;re right it probably is a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.280" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">idea because almost all</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">all ideas are stupid and so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:04.829" style="s2">probability that as you move forward on</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:07.859" style="s2">your adventure that you&#39;re gonna get it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.829" end="00:42:08.759" style="s2">right the first time is zero it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.859" end="00:42:10.829" style="s2">not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.759" end="00:42:12.930" style="s2">and so then you might think well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.829" end="00:42:13.589" style="s2">I&#39;ll just wait around until I get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:15.809" style="s2">right idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.589" end="00:42:17.759" style="s2">and which people do right so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.809" end="00:42:20.099" style="s2">like 40 year old thirteen year olds</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.759" end="00:42:22.109" style="s2">which is not a good idea so they wait</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.099" end="00:42:24.660" style="s2">around until it&#39;s Waiting for Godot</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.109" end="00:42:26.069" style="s2">until they finally got it right but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.660" end="00:42:27.930" style="s2">problem is you&#39;re too stupid to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.069" end="00:42:29.219" style="s2">when you&#39;ve got it right so waiting</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.930" end="00:42:31.289" style="s2">around isn&#39;t gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.219" end="00:42:33.569" style="s2">because even if it the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.289" end="00:42:36.210" style="s2">opportunity manifested itself to you in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.569" end="00:42:37.589" style="s2">your incomplete form the probability</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.210" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">that you would recognize it as the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.589" end="00:42:42.029" style="s2">perfect opportunity is zero you might</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">even think it&#39;s the worst possible idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.029" end="00:42:47.369" style="s2">that you&#39;ve ever heard of anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:49.739" style="s2">highly likely highly likely so so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.369" end="00:42:52.170" style="s2">had there&#39;s niches nature called data</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.739" end="00:42:54.569" style="s2">will will - stupidity which I really</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.170" end="00:42:57.779" style="s2">liked so because he thought of stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.569" end="00:42:59.969" style="s2">as being it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.779" end="00:43:02.849" style="s2">to take it into account fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.969" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">and work with it and so and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.849" end="00:43:08.549" style="s2">take these tentative steps on your</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:10.529" style="s2">pathway to destiny and you can assume</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.549" end="00:43:12.479" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna do it badly and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.529" end="00:43:13.979" style="s2">really useful because you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.479" end="00:43:16.289" style="s2">beat yourself up it&#39;s pretty easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.979" end="00:43:18.029" style="s2">it badly but the thing is it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.289" end="00:43:20.940" style="s2">better to do it badly than not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.029" end="00:43:23.279" style="s2">at all and that&#39;s the continual message</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:25.469" style="s2">that echoes through these historical</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.279" end="00:43:27.900" style="s2">stories in Genesis it&#39;s like these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.469" end="00:43:29.339" style="s2">flawed people they should have got the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.900" end="00:43:32.369" style="s2">hell out of their house way before they</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.339" end="00:43:35.160" style="s2">did and they go out and they stumble</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.369" end="00:43:39.420" style="s2">around in tyranny and famine and self</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.160" end="00:43:41.160" style="s2">betrayal and and violence and but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.420" end="00:43:43.950" style="s2">hell of a lot better than just rotting</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.160" end="00:43:46.380" style="s2">away at home and that&#39;s the that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.950" end="00:43:48.450" style="s2">so that&#39;s good and so why is that well</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.380" end="00:43:49.979" style="s2">okay so you you start your path and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:52.859" style="s2">think that you&#39;re heading you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.979" end="00:43:56.819" style="s2">towards your star and so you go in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.859" end="00:43:58.499" style="s2">direction and then because you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.819" end="00:44:01.589" style="s2">the world looks a particular way but</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.499" end="00:44:03.390" style="s2">then when you move here the world looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.589" end="00:44:05.190" style="s2">different and you&#39;re different as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.390" end="00:44:07.529" style="s2">consequence of having made that voyage</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.190" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">and so what that means is that now that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.529" end="00:44:10.980" style="s2">thing that glimmers in front of you is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:13.320" style="s2">going to have shifted</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.980" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">location because you weren&#39;t very good</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.320" end="00:44:17.000" style="s2">at specifying it to begin with and now</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:20.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re a little sharper and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.000" end="00:44:22.920" style="s2">focused than you were it&#39;s it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.280" end="00:44:27.240" style="s2">reveal itself with more accuracy to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.920" end="00:44:30.359" style="s2">and so then you have to take you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.240" end="00:44:32.609" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like 180 degree reversal but</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.359" end="00:44:36.570" style="s2">it isn&#39;t because you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.609" end="00:44:40.170" style="s2">I mean you&#39;ve gone this far and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.570" end="00:44:43.170" style="s2">long ways to get that far but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.170" end="00:44:45.020" style="s2">lot farther than you would be if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.170" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">just stayed where you were waiting and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.020" end="00:44:52.700" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t matter that you overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:55.410" style="s2">continually because as you overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.700" end="00:44:56.850" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t learn what you should</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.410" end="00:44:59.660" style="s2">have done you&#39;re going to continually</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.850" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">learn what you shouldn&#39;t keep doing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.660" end="00:45:04.650" style="s2">if you learn enough about what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:06.900" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t keep doing then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.650" end="00:45:08.300" style="s2">tantamount at some point to learning at</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.900" end="00:45:14.310" style="s2">the same time what you should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.300" end="00:45:16.020" style="s2">so it&#39;s okay so it&#39;s like this now</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.310" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">what&#39;s cool about it though I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.020" end="00:45:22.020" style="s2">that as you progress the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:23.790" style="s2">overshooting starts to decline right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.020" end="00:45:25.890" style="s2">that we know that there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.790" end="00:45:27.930" style="s2">hypothetical about that as you learn a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.890" end="00:45:29.700" style="s2">new skill like even to play it play a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.930" end="00:45:31.410" style="s2">song on the piano for example you over</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.700" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">shoot madly you&#39;re making all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.410" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">mistakes to begin with and then the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:42.570" style="s2">mistakes they disappear there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:45.060" style="s2">TED talk I think it was about this guy</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.570" end="00:45:47.010" style="s2">set up a really advanced computational</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.060" end="00:45:49.350" style="s2">recording system in his home and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:52.530" style="s2">recorded every single utterance his</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.350" end="00:45:55.260" style="s2">young child made while learning to speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.530" end="00:45:59.340" style="s2">and then he put together the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.260" end="00:46:00.540" style="s2">attempts to say certain phonemes and put</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.340" end="00:46:03.570" style="s2">them in the list and you can hear the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.540" end="00:46:05.220" style="s2">child deviating madly to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.570" end="00:46:07.890" style="s2">then after hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.220" end="00:46:11.010" style="s2">repetitions just zeroing right in on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.890" end="00:46:12.690" style="s2">exact phoneme so you know I you might</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.010" end="00:46:14.130" style="s2">not know this but when kids babble</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.690" end="00:46:16.140" style="s2">because they start babbling when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.130" end="00:46:18.840" style="s2">quite young they babble every human</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.140" end="00:46:21.420" style="s2">phoneme including all sorts of phonemes</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.840" end="00:46:24.810" style="s2">that adults can&#39;t say and then they they</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:27.240" style="s2">die into their language so that after</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.810" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">they learn say English then there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.240" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">sorts of phonemes they can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:31.080" style="s2">hear or pronounce but to begin with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:32.610" style="s2">all there</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.080" end="00:46:35.430" style="s2">which is really quite interesting but so</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.610" end="00:46:37.890" style="s2">they zip as they learn a particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.430" end="00:46:40.320" style="s2">language they zero in on the proper way</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.890" end="00:46:42.120" style="s2">to pronounce that and their errors</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.320" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">minimize and every time you learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.120" end="00:46:45.000" style="s2">something that&#39;s how it is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">really useful to know too because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.000" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">means that it&#39;s okay to wander around</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:52.860" style="s2">stupidly before you fix your destination</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:54.840" style="s2">now you see that echoed in exodus right</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.860" end="00:46:57.300" style="s2">because what happens is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.840" end="00:46:59.780" style="s2">Egyptians or the Hebrews escaped a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.300" end="00:47:02.220" style="s2">tyranny which is kind of whatever you do</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.780" end="00:47:04.140" style="s2">personally and psychologically when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.220" end="00:47:07.260" style="s2">escape from your previous set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.140" end="00:47:09.660" style="s2">stupidly held and ignorant and stubborn</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.260" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">axioms it&#39;s like away from that tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.660" end="00:47:14.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like great I freed myself from that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:15.900" style="s2">well then what well you think well now</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.310" end="00:47:18.030" style="s2">I&#39;m on the way it&#39;s no you&#39;re not now</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.900" end="00:47:20.820" style="s2">you&#39;re in the desert where you wander</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.030" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">around stupidly you know and worship the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.820" end="00:47:26.100" style="s2">wrong things until you finally organize</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">yourself morally again and head in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.100" end="00:47:31.020" style="s2">proper direction so that&#39;s worth knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:33.450" style="s2">too because you think well I got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.020" end="00:47:35.130" style="s2">a lot of things baggage excess baggage</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.450" end="00:47:37.020" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t need in my life and now</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.130" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">everything&#39;s okay it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.020" end="00:47:40.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve got rid of a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:43.170" style="s2">scaffolds that were keeping you in place</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.770" end="00:47:45.510" style="s2">even though they were pathological now</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.170" end="00:47:47.690" style="s2">you have nothing and nothing actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.510" end="00:47:50.220" style="s2">turns out to be better than something</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.690" end="00:47:52.770" style="s2">pathological but you&#39;re still stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.220" end="00:47:54.540" style="s2">the problem of nothing and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.770" end="00:47:56.190" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly why exodus is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.540" end="00:47:58.440" style="s2">structured the way that it is it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.190" end="00:48:00.330" style="s2">you escape from eternity its terrain</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.440" end="00:48:02.910" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer slaves yeah well now</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.330" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">you&#39;re nihilistic and lost it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.910" end="00:48:08.610" style="s2">necessarily an improvement but it is but</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.740" style="s2">it is the pre see it&#39;s also useful to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.610" end="00:48:13.020" style="s2">know that because you can also be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.740" end="00:48:14.070" style="s2">deluded into the idea that imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.020" end="00:48:16.470" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to become enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.070" end="00:48:18.420" style="s2">which might mean to turn all those parts</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.470" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">of you on that could be turned on you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.420" end="00:48:22.020" style="s2">think well that&#39;s just a linear pathway</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:24.390" style="s2">uphill you know it&#39;s just from one</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.020" end="00:48:25.740" style="s2">success to another it&#39;s no it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.390" end="00:48:27.090" style="s2">like here you are and you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.740" end="00:48:29.310" style="s2">too badly and the first step is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.090" end="00:48:31.710" style="s2">complete bloody catastrophe it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.310" end="00:48:34.320" style="s2">and then maybe you can pull yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.710" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">together and you hit a new plateau and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.320" end="00:48:38.550" style="s2">then that crumbles and shakes and bang</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:39.690" style="s2">it&#39;s worse again and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.550" end="00:48:41.480" style="s2">because part of the reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.690" end="00:48:44.910" style="s2">don&#39;t become enlightened is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.480" end="00:48:47.220" style="s2">punctuated by intermittent deserts</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.910" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">essentially by intermittent catastrophes</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.220" end="00:48:51.090" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t know that well then</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:53.190" style="s2">you&#39;re basically screwed because you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.090" end="00:48:54.810" style="s2">ahead on your movement forward and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.190" end="00:48:57.870" style="s2">collapse and you think well that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.810" end="00:49:00.540" style="s2">work I collapsed it&#39;s like no that&#39;s par</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.870" end="00:49:02.070" style="s2">for the course it&#39;s not indication that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.540" end="00:49:04.500" style="s2">you failed it&#39;s just indication that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.070" end="00:49:06.540" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard and that when you learn</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.500" end="00:49:08.070" style="s2">something you also unlearn something and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.540" end="00:49:09.840" style="s2">the thing you unlearned is probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.070" end="00:49:10.620" style="s2">useful and unlearning it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.840" end="00:49:11.790" style="s2">painful</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.620" end="00:49:13.770" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say if you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.790" end="00:49:16.140" style="s2">out of a bad relationship it&#39;s like not</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.770" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">every not any real there isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.140" end="00:49:20.760" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:22.590" style="s2">bad and so when you jump out of it well</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.760" end="00:49:24.210" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re in better shape but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.590" end="00:49:25.590" style="s2">still lonesome and disoriented and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.210" end="00:49:26.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know what your past was and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.590" end="00:49:28.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know what your present is and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.790" end="00:49:31.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know what your future is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.290" end="00:49:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s why people stay with</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.380" end="00:49:36.350" style="s2">the devil they know instead of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.360" end="00:49:40.770" style="s2">looking for the devil they don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.350" end="00:49:43.610" style="s2">so anyways the fact that you&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.770" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2">faults doesn&#39;t mean you have to stop and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.610" end="00:49:48.330" style="s2">thank God for that that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.900" end="00:49:50.130" style="s2">useful thing and the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.330" end="00:49:52.980" style="s2">full of faults doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.130" end="00:49:55.230" style="s2">can&#39;t learn and so you can pause it an</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.980" end="00:49:56.850" style="s2">ideal and you&#39;re gonna be wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.230" end="00:49:58.680" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter because what</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.850" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">you&#39;re right about is positing the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.680" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">moving towards it if the actual ideal</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:07.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t conceptualize perfectly well first</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:10.530" style="s2">surprise surprise cuz like what are you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.650" end="00:50:12.270" style="s2">going to do that&#39;s perfect so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.530" end="00:50:13.770" style="s2">matter that it&#39;s imperfect imperfect it</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.270" end="00:50:15.930" style="s2">just matters that you do it and that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.770" end="00:50:17.670" style="s2">move forward so that&#39;s really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.930" end="00:50:19.080" style="s2">really positive news as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.670" end="00:50:21.780" style="s2">concerned because you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.080" end="00:50:25.710" style="s2">that right you can do it badly anyone</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.780" end="00:50:27.240" style="s2">can do that so that&#39;s that&#39;s useful okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.710" end="00:50:29.700" style="s2">so like if you were an efficient person</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.240" end="00:50:32.100" style="s2">you would have just done that but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.700" end="00:50:34.950" style="s2">not but who cares you know you still end</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.100" end="00:50:36.570" style="s2">up in the in the same place and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.950" end="00:50:40.500" style="s2">the trip is even more interesting who</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.570" end="00:50:42.750" style="s2">knows probably two interesting young I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.500" end="00:50:44.490" style="s2">began to understand that the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.750" end="00:50:46.110" style="s2">psychic development by which he means</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.490" end="00:50:50.850" style="s2">psychological development or spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.110" end="00:50:52.200" style="s2">development is the self there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.850" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">linear evolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.200" end="00:50:55.619" style="s2">there&#39;s only a circumambulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:58.339" style="s2">self a getting closer it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.619" end="00:51:00.180" style="s2">like you&#39;re spiraling into something</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.339" end="00:51:02.130" style="s2">something like that and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.180" end="00:51:05.690" style="s2">you&#39;re spiraling into recedes as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.130" end="00:51:08.070" style="s2">move towards it and gets more and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.690" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">sophisticated and well developed as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.070" end="00:51:11.099" style="s2">move towards it because you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:12.750" style="s2">run out of goals right no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.099" end="00:51:15.930" style="s2">much you have your act together</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.750" end="00:51:18.089" style="s2">there&#39;s probably undoubtedly 30</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.930" end="00:51:20.700" style="s2">dimensions along which you could get</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.089" end="00:51:22.349" style="s2">your act together a lot more so and some</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.700" end="00:51:25.560" style="s2">of those aren&#39;t even conceivable to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.349" end="00:51:28.589" style="s2">when you&#39;re in your initial on carved</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.560" end="00:51:30.210" style="s2">state let&#39;s say uniform development</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.589" end="00:51:32.310" style="s2">exists at most at the beginning later</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.210" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">everything points towards the center</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.310" end="00:51:41.190" style="s2">this insight gave me stability and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:41.910" style="s2">gradually my inner peace returned so</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.190" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">this is fun</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.910" end="00:51:45.660" style="s2">on the left there that&#39;s the short</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:48.329" style="s2">Cathedral that&#39;s the one that has the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.660" end="00:51:50.339" style="s2">maze in it that I told you about they</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.329" end="00:51:53.430" style="s2">actually light that up with lasers now</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.339" end="00:51:55.859" style="s2">and so that&#39;s it lit up with lasers and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.430" end="00:51:57.780" style="s2">so so they&#39;re turning it into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.859" end="00:51:59.970" style="s2">Cathedral of light which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.780" end="00:52:01.710" style="s2">really fascinating and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.970" end="00:52:03.450" style="s2">continuation of the same idea right</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.710" end="00:52:05.670" style="s2">because the stained glass windows were</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.450" end="00:52:07.500" style="s2">obviously I wouldn&#39;t call them primitive</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.670" end="00:52:09.420" style="s2">attempts to do that I mean stained glass</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.500" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">windows are pretty impressive you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.420" end="00:52:13.079" style="s2">buddy it&#39;s an elaboration of the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">thing so now you can go to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.079" end="00:52:16.950" style="s2">Cathedral they light up the whole town</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:18.630" style="s2">like that which is really something and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.950" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">so there and there&#39;s how the cathedral</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.630" end="00:52:24.089" style="s2">is built it&#39;s a cross and remember the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:25.589" style="s2">cross is an X that marks the center of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.089" end="00:52:27.270" style="s2">the world and the cross is the place</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.589" end="00:52:29.550" style="s2">where each individual is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.270" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental message of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.550" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">Christianity is the cross marks the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">place where every single individual is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:39.660" style="s2">and it&#39;s a tragic place that consists of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:41.970" style="s2">suffering and exposure to malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.660" end="00:52:44.849" style="s2">and that the only way to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.970" end="00:52:47.099" style="s2">with it is to accept it and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.849" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">to me I don&#39;t see anything metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.099" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">about that statement whatsoever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:53.430" style="s2">like well x marks the spot</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:52:55.109" style="s2">fair enough you&#39;re in a spot you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.430" end="00:52:56.730" style="s2">right in the center of your world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.109" end="00:52:58.020" style="s2">right in the center of the world as far</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.730" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">as you&#39;re concerned and the same with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.020" end="00:53:02.280" style="s2">the rest of us it&#39;s characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:04.170" style="s2">suffering and exposure to malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.280" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that what are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.170" end="00:53:08.490" style="s2">gonna do about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.490" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">bitter resentful hateful all that does</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.490" end="00:53:13.350" style="s2">is make it worse so you have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:14.820" style="s2">it now that&#39;s not an easy thing because</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.350" end="00:53:16.920" style="s2">that&#39;s actually I would say a heroic</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.820" end="00:53:18.510" style="s2">task to voluntarily accept the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.920" end="00:53:21.210" style="s2">conditions of your own existence and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.510" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">that happens out the cross so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.210" end="00:53:25.800" style="s2">fine and that&#39;s associated with light</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:26.970" style="s2">well that&#39;s good that that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.800" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">with light you wouldn&#39;t want that to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.970" end="00:53:37.530" style="s2">associated with darkness that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:43.950" style="s2">bad thing so and so there&#39;s the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.530" end="00:53:47.160" style="s2">the the labyrinth that was built in 1280</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.950" end="00:53:50.060" style="s2">and so the idea is you walk in here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.160" end="00:53:52.560" style="s2">the same idea as that star sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.060" end="00:53:56.540" style="s2">slides that I just showed you so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.560" end="00:53:59.010" style="s2">the ideas that north south west and east</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.540" end="00:54:01.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s the whole world laid out in</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.010" end="00:54:02.850" style="s2">two dimensions and so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.410" end="00:54:03.960" style="s2">how do you get to the center now we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.850" end="00:54:06.150" style="s2">already know what the center is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.960" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">center is the center of the cross that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.150" end="00:54:11.400" style="s2">the place of maximal suffering you could</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:13.080" style="s2">say maximal malevolence as well but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.400" end="00:54:15.600" style="s2">also the place where that&#39;s transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.080" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">so how do you get there well the answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.600" end="00:54:19.890" style="s2">is well you don&#39;t just stand on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:22.830" style="s2">outside looking in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.890" end="00:54:25.230" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna help so and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.830" end="00:54:30.780" style="s2">just run right to the center even if</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.230" end="00:54:33.810" style="s2">you&#39;re in California and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.780" end="00:54:37.590" style="s2">walk in here and then you see you go</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.810" end="00:54:41.580" style="s2">like this and you go to every single</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.590" end="00:54:44.100" style="s2">place every single place on that on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.580" end="00:54:46.050" style="s2">little cosmos and then once you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.100" end="00:54:47.940" style="s2">to every single place and expanded</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.050" end="00:54:50.760" style="s2">yourself as a consequence of going north</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.940" end="00:54:52.740" style="s2">and west and east and south then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.760" end="00:54:54.780" style="s2">enough of you so that you&#39;re at so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.740" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">you can tolerate being first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.780" end="00:54:57.930" style="s2">you could figure out where the center is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">but also that you can tolerate being at</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.930" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">the center and so that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:05.070" style="s2">represents that&#39;s pretty and look I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.170" style="s2">let&#39;s make no mistake about it hey</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.070" end="00:55:09.750" style="s2">people were pretty damn serious about</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.170" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">those ideas like that&#39;s a that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.750" end="00:55:12.420" style="s2">the piece of work for people in the 12th</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.420" end="00:55:16.200" style="s2">you know those some of those damn</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:17.940" style="s2">cathedrals took 300 years to build we</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.200" end="00:55:19.060" style="s2">don&#39;t build anything that takes 300</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.940" end="00:55:20.980" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.060" end="00:55:24.220" style="s2">people were putting a lot of effort into</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.980" end="00:55:25.750" style="s2">whatever these things meant you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.220" end="00:55:29.860" style="s2">if you think they meant bearded man in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.750" end="00:55:32.500" style="s2">the sky then you know it&#39;s hard to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.860" end="00:55:34.450" style="s2">hard to account for the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.500" end="00:55:37.690" style="s2">motivation that would produce these</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.450" end="00:55:40.360" style="s2">buildings with that kind of paucity of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.690" end="00:55:42.910" style="s2">conceptualization you know the towns and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.360" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">and it was certainly the case in charge</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.910" end="00:55:47.380" style="s2">is that they groaned under the tax</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:49.030" style="s2">burden that was required to produce</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.380" end="00:55:51.730" style="s2">these now you might think well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.030" end="00:55:55.570" style="s2">partly tyrannical and no doubt that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.730" end="00:55:57.880" style="s2">the case but but that&#39;s not the whole</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.920" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">that&#39;s really relevant to this story of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.330" end="00:57:18.700" style="s2">Joseph - because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:21.670" style="s2">happens to Joseph is that well a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.700" end="00:57:23.320" style="s2">bad things happen to him because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.670" end="00:57:25.720" style="s2">the favorite of his father his brothers</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.320" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">hate him and so the first they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.720" end="00:57:29.740" style="s2">throw him in a pit I think they do throw</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:32.140" style="s2">him in a pit then they sell them to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.740" end="00:57:33.519" style="s2">slave then he ends up in we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.140" end="00:57:35.289" style="s2">through the story</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.519" end="00:57:36.969" style="s2">he ends up some places where you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.289" end="00:57:41.289" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t want to go prison</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.969" end="00:57:43.089" style="s2">being one of them but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.289" end="00:57:46.419" style="s2">because even when they put him in prison</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.089" end="00:57:47.739" style="s2">he&#39;s actually not imprisoned he just</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.419" end="00:57:49.899" style="s2">figures out how to make the prison work</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.739" end="00:57:52.359" style="s2">way better and then he&#39;s in control of</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.899" end="00:57:55.719" style="s2">the prison and it really it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.359" end="00:57:58.569" style="s2">interesting I had this friend you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.719" end="00:58:01.689" style="s2">and he was very smart but very cynical</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.569" end="00:58:04.119" style="s2">and he wasn&#39;t employed very well and he</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.689" end="00:58:06.659" style="s2">got a little older and he should have</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.119" end="00:58:08.919" style="s2">given his level of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.659" end="00:58:10.269" style="s2">employability and so he had to take jobs</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.919" end="00:58:12.130" style="s2">that weren&#39;t very intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.269" end="00:58:14.289" style="s2">challenging you know and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.130" end="00:58:17.169" style="s2">things I tried to convince him of was</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.289" end="00:58:18.999" style="s2">that even if he worked he wanted to work</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.169" end="00:58:20.499" style="s2">behind the parts department in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.999" end="00:58:22.899" style="s2">automotive store because he liked cars</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.499" end="00:58:25.089" style="s2">but it was beneath him you know because</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.899" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">it was sort of a as far as he was</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.089" end="00:58:29.919" style="s2">concerned it was a he was too smart for</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:31.239" style="s2">a job like that which actually turned</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.919" end="00:58:32.589" style="s2">out not to be true he wasn&#39;t smart</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.239" end="00:58:34.449" style="s2">enough for a job like that or he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.589" end="00:58:35.759" style="s2">wise enough but you know what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.449" end="00:58:38.309" style="s2">things I tried to tell him was then</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.759" end="00:58:41.469" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the situation wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.309" end="00:58:43.749" style="s2">because even in a simple job so-called</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.469" end="00:58:45.159" style="s2">simple job like let&#39;s say dishwashing in</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.749" end="00:58:48.069" style="s2">a restaurant which I did an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.159" end="00:58:50.229" style="s2">it&#39;s not that simple you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.069" end="00:58:52.119" style="s2">a lot of other people very fast staff</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.229" end="00:58:54.519" style="s2">changeover you&#39;re feeding people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.119" end="00:58:58.059" style="s2">helping them have a celebration you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.519" end="00:59:00.549" style="s2">helping them take a break like you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.059" end="00:59:02.469" style="s2">do it really well and then the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.549" end="00:59:03.669" style="s2">can operate properly and then people can</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.469" end="00:59:06.699" style="s2">come out to the restaurant it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.669" end="00:59:07.929" style="s2">bloody catastrophe and like your even</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.699" end="00:59:10.299" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.929" end="00:59:12.369" style="s2">menial job so to speak like dishwashing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.299" end="00:59:15.009" style="s2">there are ways of doing it really badly</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.369" end="00:59:17.229" style="s2">resentfully and horribly and doing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.009" end="00:59:18.579" style="s2">really well and as soon as you do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.229" end="00:59:19.149" style="s2">really well it&#39;s not a menial job</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.579" end="00:59:22.089" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.149" end="00:59:23.709" style="s2">it immediately transforms no I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.089" end="00:59:26.289" style="s2">can be around people who won&#39;t let that</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.709" end="00:59:28.359" style="s2">happen and you should go get another job</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.289" end="00:59:30.959" style="s2">if that&#39;s the case but if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.359" end="00:59:35.529" style="s2">properly then it&#39;s not menial at all and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.959" end="00:59:37.029" style="s2">that&#39;s also a good way out of resentment</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.529" end="00:59:38.589" style="s2">you think well I&#39;ve just got this you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.029" end="00:59:40.809" style="s2">know two-bit job it&#39;s like yeah what if</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.589" end="00:59:42.759" style="s2">you did it as well as you possibly could</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.809" end="00:59:43.869" style="s2">you know what would happen well the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.759" end="00:59:46.029" style="s2">first thing that would happen is you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.869" end="00:59:47.279" style="s2">get a lot smarter that&#39;s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.029" end="00:59:52.289" style="s2">that that&#39;s hardly</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.279" end="00:59:55.469" style="s2">a negative thing okay so that&#39;s the coat</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.289" end="00:59:57.449" style="s2">of many colors so it&#39;s an intimation of</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.469" end="00:59:58.949" style="s2">what Joseph is like and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.449" end="01:00:01.890" style="s2">seeing with all of these patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.949" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2">figures is the continual realization of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.890" end="01:00:07.469" style="s2">the ideal person right you could think</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:09.809" style="s2">about it as successive approximations of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.469" end="01:00:11.239" style="s2">the ideal person and the story is</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.809" end="01:00:13.259" style="s2">exploring all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.239" end="01:00:15.419" style="s2">possibilities including ones that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.259" end="01:00:17.339" style="s2">very violent and catastrophic and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.419" end="01:00:20.299" style="s2">malevolent it&#39;s trying to cover the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.339" end="01:00:23.159" style="s2">entire territory and to focus in on</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.299" end="01:00:27.089" style="s2">what&#39;s the proper way through the maze</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.159" end="01:00:28.409" style="s2">the maze of life the labyrinth and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.089" end="01:00:31.019" style="s2">hint here is that while you should be</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.409" end="01:00:33.390" style="s2">multi-dimensional these are the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.019" end="01:00:34.949" style="s2">generations of Jacob Joseph being 17</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.390" end="01:00:36.659" style="s2">years old was feeding the flock with his</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.949" end="01:00:38.130" style="s2">brethren and the lad was with his sons</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.659" end="01:00:40.619" style="s2">of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.130" end="01:00:45.109" style="s2">his father&#39;s wives and Joseph brought</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.619" end="01:00:47.609" style="s2">unto his father their evil report well</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.109" end="01:00:49.079" style="s2">we already know that Joseph is Jacob&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.609" end="01:00:52.049" style="s2">favorite so that doesn&#39;t make him very</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.079" end="01:00:54.959" style="s2">popular among his brothers he&#39;s younger</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.049" end="01:00:58.019" style="s2">and now we also find out that he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.959" end="01:01:00.089" style="s2">set up more or less as you might say a</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.019" end="01:01:02.189" style="s2">snitch because that&#39;s what this phrase</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.089" end="01:01:03.269" style="s2">means is that he goes out and watches</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.189" end="01:01:04.890" style="s2">his older brothers and if they do</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.269" end="01:01:08.009" style="s2">something they shouldn&#39;t do then he</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.890" end="01:01:10.109" style="s2">comes trotting back to Jacob and reports</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.009" end="01:01:12.419" style="s2">well that&#39;s not gonna make you popular</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.109" end="01:01:18.029" style="s2">so and you would say well is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.419" end="01:01:19.439" style="s2">Joseph&#39;s problem or jacob&#39;s problem and</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.029" end="01:01:20.729" style="s2">I would say and this is something I</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.439" end="01:01:23.819" style="s2">learned from reading dealing to is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.729" end="01:01:26.189" style="s2">that&#39;s a conspiratorial problem right is</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.819" end="01:01:29.249" style="s2">it&#39;s the parents at fault but so is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.189" end="01:01:33.749" style="s2">child who agrees to do that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.249" end="01:01:35.099" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a little cabal going and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.749" end="01:01:37.739" style="s2">might say well it&#39;s only the parents</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.099" end="01:01:40.709" style="s2">fault but the son will be taking</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.739" end="01:01:42.929" style="s2">advantage of every advantage that offers</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.709" end="01:01:47.130" style="s2">him because he could say no to I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.929" end="01:01:49.949" style="s2">do that so anyway so Joseph is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.130" end="01:01:53.099" style="s2">favorite he&#39;s a bit of a teacher&#39;s pet</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.949" end="01:01:54.509" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like now Israel</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.099" end="01:01:55.859" style="s2">loved Joseph more than all his colors</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.509" end="01:01:57.799" style="s2">because he was the son of his old age</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.859" end="01:02:00.029" style="s2">and he made him a coat of many colors</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.799" end="01:02:01.230" style="s2">and when his brethren saw that their</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.029" end="01:02:02.550" style="s2">father loved him more than</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.230" end="01:02:04.650" style="s2">all his brethren they hated him and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.550" end="01:02:07.350" style="s2">could not speak peaceably unto him so</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.650" end="01:02:08.430" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have a child or number of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.350" end="01:02:10.369" style="s2">children and one of them is your</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.430" end="01:02:13.170" style="s2">favorite how should you treat that child</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.369" end="01:02:15.660" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t obvious that you do them</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.170" end="01:02:18.540" style="s2">any favors by overtly making them your</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.660" end="01:02:20.130" style="s2">favorite right I mean first of all maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.540" end="01:02:22.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t challenge them as much as you</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.130" end="01:02:25.109" style="s2">should and second of all you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.320" end="01:02:27.390" style="s2">set up a Cain and Abel like scenario in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.109" end="01:02:29.100" style="s2">the household and that or maybe it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.390" end="01:02:30.330" style="s2">eatable situation too because you happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.100" end="01:02:33.150" style="s2">to love your child more than you love</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.330" end="01:02:37.980" style="s2">your your spouse which is that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.150" end="01:02:40.200" style="s2">recipe for familial harmony so it seems</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.980" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2">to be a bad idea okay so now we have two</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.200" end="01:02:46.590" style="s2">reasons that Joseph is not liked by his</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.500" end="01:02:49.140" style="s2">brothers is one is well he&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.590" end="01:02:51.090" style="s2">Rat Fink and the other is that he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.140" end="01:02:52.920" style="s2">peas the favorite and he&#39;s playing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.090" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">to the hilt by the looks of things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.920" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">when his brethren saw that their father</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:58.380" style="s2">loved him more than all his brethren</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:03:02.190" style="s2">then all his brethren they hated him and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.380" end="01:03:04.530" style="s2">could not speak peaceably unto him okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.190" end="01:03:06.450" style="s2">and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.530" end="01:03:10.440" style="s2">it to his brethren and they hated him</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.450" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">the more he said unto them hear I pray</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.440" end="01:03:14.550" style="s2">you this dream which I have dreamed for</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:17.210" style="s2">behold we were binding wheat sheaves in</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.550" end="01:03:19.560" style="s2">the field and lo my sheaf arose and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.210" end="01:03:25.770" style="s2">behold your sheaves stood round about</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.560" end="01:03:27.420" style="s2">and bowed to my sheaf and his and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.770" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">remember he&#39;s yeah the young one right</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.420" end="01:03:31.109" style="s2">and and also the daughter of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:32.550" style="s2">favorite wife which is another thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.109" end="01:03:33.540" style="s2">that&#39;s or the son of the favorite wife</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.550" end="01:03:35.670" style="s2">which is another thing not really</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.540" end="01:03:38.040" style="s2">working in his favor and his brethren</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.670" end="01:03:39.570" style="s2">said to him shalt thou indeed reign over</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.040" end="01:03:42.390" style="s2">us or shalt thou indeed have dominion</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.570" end="01:03:44.520" style="s2">over us and they hated them yet the more</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.390" end="01:03:46.680" style="s2">for his dreams and for his words well</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.520" end="01:03:48.869" style="s2">there there&#39;s a shock you know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.680" end="01:03:50.940" style="s2">makes perfect sense so and it gets worse</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.869" end="01:03:54.750" style="s2">so you see here well there&#39;s the wheat</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.940" end="01:03:56.460" style="s2">sheaves bowing there and and then you</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.750" end="01:03:58.800" style="s2">see this what&#39;s going on here well</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.460" end="01:04:02.820" style="s2">that&#39;s not the end of his let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.800" end="01:04:04.109" style="s2">grandiosity and there&#39;s an idea to in in</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.820" end="01:04:05.850" style="s2">the Old Testament especially in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.109" end="01:04:08.340" style="s2">stories of Joseph that if God sends you</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.850" end="01:04:09.720" style="s2">a dream twice he really means it and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.340" end="01:04:11.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true although I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.720" end="01:04:14.530" style="s2">do know that people have repeating</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.250" end="01:04:17.080" style="s2">dreams it might be true that the a dream</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.530" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">you have twice is really trying to punch</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.080" end="01:04:21.240" style="s2">something home you know it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:23.620" style="s2">the case that recurrent nightmares are</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.240" end="01:04:26.350" style="s2">meaningful and that recurrent nightmares</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.620" end="01:04:28.510" style="s2">are associated quite tightly with</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.350" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">decreased states of mental health and</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.510" end="01:04:32.740" style="s2">that if you can treat the nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:35.800" style="s2">which is often quite easy by the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.740" end="01:04:38.230" style="s2">then the some of the mental health</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.800" end="01:04:40.540" style="s2">problems will decrease so repeated</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.230" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">dreams seem to be important anyways he</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.540" end="01:04:44.080" style="s2">dreamed yet another dream and told it to</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:47.020" style="s2">his brethren and said behold I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.080" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">another dream and be and behold the Sun</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.020" end="01:04:52.330" style="s2">and the moon and the Eleven stars bowed</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:54.100" style="s2">to me and he told it to his father and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.330" end="01:04:55.960" style="s2">to his brothers and his father rebuked</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.100" end="01:04:57.580" style="s2">him and said unto you unto Him what is</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.960" end="01:05:00.040" style="s2">this dream that thou has dreamed shall I</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.580" end="01:05:02.260" style="s2">in my and your mother and your brothers</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.040" end="01:05:05.440" style="s2">indeed come to bow down ourselves to</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.260" end="01:05:08.290" style="s2">thee to the earth and his brethren</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.440" end="01:05:11.050" style="s2">envied him but his father observed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.290" end="01:05:12.760" style="s2">saying well what the hell do you make of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.050" end="01:05:15.670" style="s2">something like that right if someone</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.760" end="01:05:17.790" style="s2">tells you that it&#39;s like are they</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.670" end="01:05:19.900" style="s2">responsible for their dreams</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.790" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t really seem we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.900" end="01:05:24.190" style="s2">hold ourselves responsible for for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:26.230" style="s2">dreams we have at night and what do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.190" end="01:05:27.700" style="s2">make of a dream is like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.230" end="01:05:28.930" style="s2">things that Jung pointed out this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.700" end="01:05:31.360" style="s2">where he differed from Freud</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.930" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">substantially as Freud tended to think</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.360" end="01:05:36.970" style="s2">that the dream hid its meaning because</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:39.430" style="s2">its contents weren&#39;t acceptable to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.970" end="01:05:41.410" style="s2">conscious mind and Jung said no no you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.430" end="01:05:43.030" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that&#39;s not what happens</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.410" end="01:05:45.640" style="s2">what happens is the dream is doing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.030" end="01:05:47.890" style="s2">best it can to express something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.640" end="01:05:49.600" style="s2">the person doesn&#39;t yet really know and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.890" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">Jung thought about the dream as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.600" end="01:05:53.110" style="s2">manifestation of nature it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:55.690" style="s2">associated with the ego at all it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.110" end="01:05:57.250" style="s2">just like you have a dream and there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.690" end="01:05:58.750" style="s2">things happening and it the same way</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.250" end="01:06:00.820" style="s2">that when you walk into a dinner party</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.750" end="01:06:03.310" style="s2">there are things happening there you</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.820" end="01:06:05.320" style="s2">know it&#39;s not the dream isn&#39;t something</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.310" end="01:06:07.030" style="s2">that&#39;s subject to your capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.320" end="01:06:09.670" style="s2">manipulation it&#39;s something that happens</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.030" end="01:06:11.800" style="s2">to you not something that you do and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.670" end="01:06:13.720" style="s2">so if someone has a dream like that well</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.800" end="01:06:16.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got three options you can just</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.720" end="01:06:18.220" style="s2">discount dreams altogether which is what</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.630" end="01:06:21.100" style="s2">people in the modern world tend to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.220" end="01:06:22.510" style="s2">which is a very bad idea because there</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.100" end="01:06:25.030" style="s2">are thoughts and you shouldn&#39;t discount</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.510" end="01:06:26.950" style="s2">them you know I mean and they&#39;re hardly</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.030" end="01:06:27.760" style="s2">random as some neuroscientists claim</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.950" end="01:06:30.609" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.760" end="01:06:33.310" style="s2">absolutely cockeyed theory that random</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.609" end="01:06:36.460" style="s2">he like television snow on a TV set if</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.310" end="01:06:38.320" style="s2">it was random so so one is while you</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.460" end="01:06:40.210" style="s2">just discount dreams the other is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.320" end="01:06:42.850" style="s2">you consider the person a liar and a</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.210" end="01:06:46.869" style="s2">braggart and a narcissist and the third</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.850" end="01:06:48.670" style="s2">is well what&#39;s the third it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.869" end="01:06:52.420" style="s2">dreamt that the Sun and the moon and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.670" end="01:06:54.940" style="s2">stars bowed down to him you might think</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.420" end="01:06:56.260" style="s2">about that two or three times so but</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.940" end="01:06:58.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.260" end="01:07:00.550" style="s2">going to make you happy and his brethren</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.900" end="01:07:02.440" style="s2">went to feed their father&#39;s flock and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.550" end="01:07:04.900" style="s2">shechem so they took off and Israel said</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.440" end="01:07:06.670" style="s2">unto Joseph do you not thy brethren feed</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.900" end="01:07:08.820" style="s2">the flock and Shechem come and I will</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.670" end="01:07:12.700" style="s2">send thee unto Him and he said him and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.820" end="01:07:15.040" style="s2">he said to him here here am I and when</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.700" end="01:07:16.690" style="s2">they saw him afar off even before he</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.040" end="01:07:20.170" style="s2">came near unto them they conspired</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.690" end="01:07:22.900" style="s2">against him to slay him rough people</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.170" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">back then right this is this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.900" end="01:07:29.350" style="s2">thing is happening quite frequently and</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:32.530" style="s2">they said to one another behold the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.350" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">dreamer cometh come now therefore let us</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.530" end="01:07:37.270" style="s2">slay him cast him into some pit and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:39.580" style="s2">will say some evil beast hath devoured</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.270" end="01:07:41.800" style="s2">him and we shall see what becomes of his</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.580" end="01:07:43.540" style="s2">dreams so there&#39;s an echo of the Cain</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.800" end="01:07:47.800" style="s2">and Abel story there obviously you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.540" end="01:07:49.270" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s not quite as clear because</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.800" end="01:07:51.790" style="s2">in the Cain and Abel story Abel is</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.270" end="01:07:54.070" style="s2">clearly just doing well and here you</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.790" end="01:07:55.510" style="s2">can&#39;t quite get a handle on Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.070" end="01:07:57.310" style="s2">character you can&#39;t tell if he is</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.510" end="01:07:59.260" style="s2">actually the elect or if he&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.310" end="01:08:02.050" style="s2">spoiled brat with delusions of grandeur</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.260" end="01:08:05.380" style="s2">you know and but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.050" end="01:08:07.750" style="s2">because his brothers are so irritated at</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.380" end="01:08:10.530" style="s2">his the fact that he&#39;s favored and</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.750" end="01:08:14.590" style="s2">perhaps even the fact that he might be</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.530" end="01:08:16.839" style="s2">someone destined for for something</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.590" end="01:08:20.140" style="s2">special that they find it perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.839" end="01:08:24.040" style="s2">reasonable to destroy that and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.140" end="01:08:26.770" style="s2">hard so interesting how often that motif</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.040" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">of pulling down an ideal manifests</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.770" end="01:08:31.029" style="s2">itself in these old stories right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:32.770" style="s2">it&#39;s the pattern is established in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.029" end="01:08:34.600" style="s2">Cain and Abel story it just repeats and</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.770" end="01:08:36.279" style="s2">repeats and repeats and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.600" end="01:08:38.650" style="s2">dead true I think it just repeats all</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.279" end="01:08:41.109" style="s2">the time so that people are annoyed</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.650" end="01:08:42.940" style="s2">about how tragic their lives are</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.109" end="01:08:44.679" style="s2">annoyed that they&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.940" end="01:08:46.630" style="s2">malevolence and they&#39;re annoyed that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.679" end="01:08:49.089" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing as well as other</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.630" end="01:08:50.949" style="s2">people are doing and that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.089" end="01:08:51.580" style="s2">that puts them exactly into this state</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.949" end="01:08:54.219" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.580" end="01:08:56.020" style="s2">now maybe with modern people if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.219" end="01:08:57.909" style="s2">gonna kill someone because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.020" end="01:08:59.409" style="s2">resentful as a modern person you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.909" end="01:09:01.540" style="s2">generally slay them and throw them into</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.409" end="01:09:03.850" style="s2">a pit you know what you do is you just</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.540" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">kill them slowly over a few decades and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.850" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious to me that that&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:12.880" style="s2">better so I&#39;ve seen plenty of married</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:16.389" style="s2">couples who were in that situation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.880" end="01:09:18.310" style="s2">like it&#39;s like yeah well there is this</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.389" end="01:09:20.109" style="s2">mitch hedberg he used to complain about</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.310" end="01:09:25.869" style="s2">turtlenecks hey so it was like being</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.109" end="01:09:27.429" style="s2">strangled by a really weak [ __ ] it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.869" end="01:09:32.529" style="s2">probably really politically incorrect</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.429" end="01:09:36.009" style="s2">jokes but it&#39;s a funny joke so and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.529" end="01:09:37.989" style="s2">you see you see relationships that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.009" end="01:09:39.580" style="s2">like that it&#39;s like each person has</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.989" end="01:09:40.690" style="s2">their hands around the neck of the other</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.580" end="01:09:43.630" style="s2">person but they don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.690" end="01:09:45.909" style="s2">courage to actually to squeeze they just</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.630" end="01:09:48.639" style="s2">put enough pressure on just cut the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.909" end="01:09:51.250" style="s2">circulation off a tiny bit so the person</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.639" end="01:09:56.230" style="s2">just gets like they die over a 30-year</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.250" end="01:09:57.639" style="s2">period something like that so yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.230" end="01:10:02.830" style="s2">you all laugh because you know it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.639" end="01:10:04.570" style="s2">that&#39;s why and we will say some evil</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.830" end="01:10:06.850" style="s2">beast half devoured him which would be</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.570" end="01:10:09.580" style="s2">true actually it would be the evil beast</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.850" end="01:10:11.290" style="s2">that&#39;s inside the brothers and we shall</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.580" end="01:10:13.780" style="s2">see what will become of his dreams</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.290" end="01:10:17.560" style="s2">haha that&#39;s a that&#39;s interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.780" end="01:10:19.449" style="s2">because so they want to spite themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.560" end="01:10:20.920" style="s2">because maybe Joseph is something</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.449" end="01:10:24.580" style="s2">special and then they want to spite</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.920" end="01:10:26.290" style="s2">their father which is probably not the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.580" end="01:10:28.119" style="s2">wisest idea because they owe him some</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.290" end="01:10:29.770" style="s2">gratitude I mean maybe he&#39;s acting like</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.119" end="01:10:31.750" style="s2">a pain in the neck there&#39;s some evidence</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.770" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">for that but this is a little bit harsh</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.750" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">but they also want to spite God just</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:39.219" style="s2">like Cain did because that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:41.830" style="s2">means we shall see what will become of</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.219" end="01:10:44.260" style="s2">his dreams right because then as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.830" end="01:10:46.989" style="s2">you&#39;re in some sense trying to fight</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.260" end="01:10:48.760" style="s2">against the intuition of someone the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.989" end="01:10:50.409" style="s2">natural intuition of someone you set</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.760" end="01:10:54.760" style="s2">yourself up against the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.409" end="01:10:56.860" style="s2">being itself and so pretty bad</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.760" end="01:10:58.269" style="s2">and Ruben heard it and he delivered them</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.860" end="01:11:00.219" style="s2">out of their hands and said no let us</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.269" end="01:11:02.500" style="s2">not kill him and Ruben said unto them</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.219" end="01:11:03.849" style="s2">shed no blood but cast him into this pit</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.500" end="01:11:05.650" style="s2">that&#39;s in the wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.849" end="01:11:09.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like Rubens the good guy in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.650" end="01:11:11.500" style="s2">story yeah and and there&#39;s no water in</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.460" end="01:11:13.900" style="s2">the pit by the way inlay no hand upon</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.500" end="01:11:16.079" style="s2">him that he might rid him out of their</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.900" end="01:11:17.380" style="s2">hands to deliver him to his father again</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.079" end="01:11:20.460" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.380" end="01:11:23.110" style="s2">so Ruben was actually trying to save him</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.460" end="01:11:24.760" style="s2">said he might rid him out of their hands</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.110" end="01:11:27.309" style="s2">to deliver him to his father again and</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.760" end="01:11:28.630" style="s2">it came to pass when Joseph came unto</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.309" end="01:11:31.059" style="s2">his brethren that they stripped him of</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.630" end="01:11:34.210" style="s2">his coat his coat of many colors that</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.059" end="01:11:35.889" style="s2">was on him and they took him and cast</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.210" end="01:11:42.219" style="s2">him into a pit and the pit was empty and</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.889" end="01:11:43.750" style="s2">there was no water in it and then they</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.219" end="01:11:45.010" style="s2">sat down to eat bread and lifted up</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.750" end="01:11:46.840" style="s2">their eyes and looked and behold a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.010" end="01:11:49.389" style="s2">company of Ishmaelites come came from</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.840" end="01:11:51.460" style="s2">Gilead with their camels bearing spices</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.389" end="01:11:53.079" style="s2">and balm and myrrh going to carry it</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.460" end="01:11:56.079" style="s2">down to Egypt and Judah said unto his</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.079" end="01:11:57.989" style="s2">brethren how does it profit us if we</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.079" end="01:12:01.000" style="s2">kill our brother and conceal his blood</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.989" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">so he&#39;s the practical guy here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.000" end="01:12:06.280" style="s2">why would we kill him when we can sell</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:08.230" style="s2">him it&#39;s like come let us sell him to</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.280" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.230" end="01:12:13.090" style="s2">upon him for he is our brother in our</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:15.159" style="s2">flesh and his brethren were content then</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.090" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">there passed by Midianites merchantman</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.159" end="01:12:18.550" style="s2">and they drew and lifted up joseph out</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:21.489" style="s2">of the pit and sold joseph to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.550" end="01:12:24.519" style="s2">Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.489" end="01:12:26.349" style="s2">a amount that echoes through into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.519" end="01:12:28.179" style="s2">future and they brought Joseph into</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.349" end="01:12:31.059" style="s2">Egypt I&#39;m never really sure how these</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.179" end="01:12:33.849" style="s2">slavery stories work it&#39;s like so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.059" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">two 2,500 3,000 years ago and I decided</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.849" end="01:12:37.329" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna sell you to the Ishmaelites</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:38.860" style="s2">and that just works out they I get the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.329" end="01:12:40.599" style="s2">money you get to be a slave and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.860" end="01:12:42.099" style="s2">take you away I don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.599" end="01:12:43.539" style="s2">how that works I can&#39;t figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.099" end="01:12:44.530" style="s2">people weren&#39;t just selling each other</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.539" end="01:12:51.030" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.530" end="01:12:51.030" style="s2">but maybe if your family you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.889" end="01:12:59.949" style="s2">so they&#39;re they sold him and Reuben</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.090" end="01:13:01.900" style="s2">returned to the pit and behold Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.949" end="01:13:03.610" style="s2">was not there and Reuben rent his</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.900" end="01:13:05.079" style="s2">clothes so Reubens very upset about this</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.610" end="01:13:07.300" style="s2">and he returned unto his brothers and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.079" end="01:13:08.130" style="s2">said the child is not and I where shall</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.300" end="01:13:10.770" style="s2">I go</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.130" end="01:13:12.990" style="s2">and they conspired they took Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.770" end="01:13:14.730" style="s2">coat and killed a kid of the goats and</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.990" end="01:13:16.020" style="s2">dipped the coat in the blood that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.730" end="01:13:18.930" style="s2">interesting too because blood is</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.020" end="01:13:21.210" style="s2">actually another color right so he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.930" end="01:13:24.030" style="s2">this coat of many colors and blood is</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.210" end="01:13:26.040" style="s2">definitely a color and so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.030" end="01:13:28.680" style="s2">addition in some sense of the color of</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.040" end="01:13:32.070" style="s2">blood to Joseph&#39;s coat and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.680" end="01:13:33.690" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a necessary color because</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.070" end="01:13:35.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re serious enough</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.690" end="01:13:38.670" style="s2">till your coat has been dipped in blood</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.490" end="01:13:40.140" style="s2">that can happen in many ways and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.670" end="01:13:43.410" style="s2">sent the coat of many colors and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.140" end="01:13:45.390" style="s2">brought it to their father and said so</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.410" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">they lied to him it&#39;s very very nasty</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.390" end="01:13:50.820" style="s2">business this they they sell his son to</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:53.580" style="s2">slavery they claim that he&#39;s dead they</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.820" end="01:13:56.070" style="s2">lied to him they they put him into an</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.580" end="01:13:58.800" style="s2">extreme state of grief there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.070" end="01:14:01.530" style="s2">hatred underneath that right tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.800" end="01:14:05.460" style="s2">amount of hatred for Joseph and also for</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.530" end="01:14:07.890" style="s2">Jacob this we have found know now</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.460" end="01:14:09.660" style="s2">whether it be thy sons coat or not and</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.890" end="01:14:13.110" style="s2">he knew it he said it&#39;s my son&#39;s coat</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.660" end="01:14:15.390" style="s2">and evil beast has devoured him Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.110" end="01:14:17.100" style="s2">is without doubt rent in pieces and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.390" end="01:14:18.990" style="s2">Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.100" end="01:14:20.580" style="s2">on his loins and mourned for many days</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.990" end="01:14:22.380" style="s2">and all his sons and daughters rose up</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.580" end="01:14:24.390" style="s2">to comfort him but he refused to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.380" end="01:14:28.320" style="s2">comforted and he said I&#39;ll go down unto</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.390" end="01:14:34.710" style="s2">my grave mourning my son does his father</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.320" end="01:14:42.030" style="s2">wept for him so that&#39;s Jacob collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.710" end="01:14:44.550" style="s2">at the news and the Midianites sold</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.850" end="01:14:51.240" style="s2">Egypt and port afar an officer of</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.890" end="01:14:53.370" style="s2">Pharaoh captain of the guard and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.240" end="01:14:54.720" style="s2">Egyptian bought him of the hands of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.370" end="01:14:59.790" style="s2">Ishmaelites which had brought him down</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.720" end="01:15:02.150" style="s2">thither so now he&#39;s a slave so now you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.790" end="01:15:04.740" style="s2">think well that would be this is a man</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.150" end="01:15:07.530" style="s2">who has a lot of reason to be irritated</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.740" end="01:15:09.660" style="s2">at the structure of reality right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.530" end="01:15:11.550" style="s2">gone from being the favorite to being</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.660" end="01:15:14.040" style="s2">betrayed by all of his brothers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.550" end="01:15:15.720" style="s2">pretty rough and then he&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.040" end="01:15:18.360" style="s2">transformed into a slave and now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.720" end="01:15:20.730" style="s2">being he&#39;s being sold to work as a slave</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.360" end="01:15:21.900" style="s2">so you&#39;d think that that would corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.730" end="01:15:23.580" style="s2">his character because</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.900" end="01:15:25.409" style="s2">you know one of the things I think this</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.580" end="01:15:27.030" style="s2">is the case anyways I think people are</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.409" end="01:15:29.159" style="s2">always looking for an excuse to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.030" end="01:15:30.810" style="s2">their character corrupted because if</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.159" end="01:15:32.370" style="s2">your character is corrupted then you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.810" end="01:15:33.900" style="s2">to lie and you get to cheat you get to</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.370" end="01:15:35.489" style="s2">steal and you get to betray and you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.900" end="01:15:38.070" style="s2">to act resentfully and you get to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.489" end="01:15:39.449" style="s2">nothing and that&#39;s all easy it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.070" end="01:15:40.739" style="s2">to lie than to tell the truth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.449" end="01:15:42.719" style="s2">easier to do nothing than to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.739" end="01:15:45.060" style="s2">something so there&#39;s always part of you</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.719" end="01:15:47.040" style="s2">thinking well I need a justification for</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.060" end="01:15:51.540" style="s2">being useless and horrible because</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.040" end="01:15:53.790" style="s2">that&#39;d be a lot less work and so then if</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.540" end="01:15:56.190" style="s2">something terrible comes along you think</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.790" end="01:15:58.830" style="s2">AHA that&#39;s just exactly the excuse that</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.190" end="01:16:02.580" style="s2">I was waiting for and then out all that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.830" end="01:16:04.880" style="s2">comes you know Solzhenitsyn when he was</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.580" end="01:16:08.130" style="s2">in the concentration camps in Russia</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:09.690" style="s2">watching how people behaved you know he</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.130" end="01:16:11.429" style="s2">said that there were people that were</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.690" end="01:16:13.469" style="s2">put in the camps who immediately became</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.429" end="01:16:15.030" style="s2">trustees or guards and they were even</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.469" end="01:16:17.040" style="s2">more vicious than the people who had</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.030" end="01:16:20.969" style="s2">been hired as guards and his idea was</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.040" end="01:16:24.120" style="s2">that they had collected all that he</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.969" end="01:16:27.390" style="s2">called it foul Ness if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.120" end="01:16:28.860" style="s2">correctly around them in normal life but</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.390" end="01:16:30.719" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.860" end="01:16:32.340" style="s2">express it but as soon as you gave them</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.719" end="01:16:37.770" style="s2">the opportunity it was like there it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.340" end="01:16:39.690" style="s2">right away and so so one of the messages</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.770" end="01:16:42.929" style="s2">that seems to echo through these old</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.690" end="01:16:44.400" style="s2">testament stories is that just because</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.929" end="01:16:47.460" style="s2">something terrible happens to you</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.400" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you get to be that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.460" end="01:16:52.469" style="s2">get to wander off the path and make</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:55.050" style="s2">things worse and maybe it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.469" end="01:16:57.900" style="s2">how terrible it is that what happens to</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.050" end="01:16:59.550" style="s2">you that&#39;s a tough call you know because</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.900" end="01:17:02.040" style="s2">you see people now and then in life who</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.550" end="01:17:03.449" style="s2">they&#39;ve really got it rough man like 50</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.040" end="01:17:05.190" style="s2">bad things are happening to them at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.449" end="01:17:06.480" style="s2">same time and you think oh it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.190" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">wonder if you were bitter and resentful</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.480" end="01:17:11.580" style="s2">and hostile be like yeah no wonder but</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:12.870" style="s2">then you meet people and Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.580" end="01:17:14.250" style="s2">again talked about this in the Gulag</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.870" end="01:17:15.900" style="s2">Archipelago he said he met lots of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.250" end="01:17:18.480" style="s2">people in the North Lodz</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.900" end="01:17:20.820" style="s2">he met enough people to impress him in</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:22.860" style="s2">the concentration camp system who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.820" end="01:17:25.949" style="s2">allow their misfortunes to corrupt them</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.860" end="01:17:27.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s something because maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.949" end="01:17:30.360" style="s2">only real misfortune is to become</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.719" end="01:17:32.750" style="s2">corrupted that&#39;s a really useful thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.360" end="01:17:35.100" style="s2">to think you know maybe the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.750" end="01:17:35.790" style="s2">maybe the rest of it is trivial in</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.100" end="01:17:37.650" style="s2">comparison</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.790" end="01:17:39.810" style="s2">I know that&#39;s a rough thing because you</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.650" end="01:17:41.670" style="s2">can be in very harsh circumstances but I</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.810" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">do think there&#39;s something to that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.670" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">the Lord was with Joseph and he was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.920" end="01:17:47.160" style="s2">prosperous man and he was in the house</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:48.780" style="s2">of his master the Egyptian and his</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.160" end="01:17:50.340" style="s2">master saw that the Lord was with him</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.780" end="01:17:52.410" style="s2">and that Lord made all that he did to</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.340" end="01:17:53.670" style="s2">prosper in his hand so that&#39;s an echo of</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.410" end="01:17:56.160" style="s2">the idea that we encountered earlier</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.670" end="01:17:58.650" style="s2">about walking with God right so Adam</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.160" end="01:18:00.150" style="s2">walked with God before he ate the fruit</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.650" end="01:18:02.910" style="s2">with Eve and then he wouldn&#39;t walk with</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.150" end="01:18:04.770" style="s2">God and then Noah walked with God and</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.910" end="01:18:06.930" style="s2">Abraham walked with God and so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.770" end="01:18:08.340" style="s2">is well that&#39;s that alignment with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.930" end="01:18:10.980" style="s2">highest ideal I think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.340" end="01:18:12.690" style="s2">like that and you know we could think</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.980" end="01:18:16.470" style="s2">about that as a metaphysical claim as</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.690" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">well but I don&#39;t think it is I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.470" end="01:18:22.650" style="s2">got thousands of letters now in the last</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:26.280" style="s2">year from people who have told me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.650" end="01:18:28.920" style="s2">they were in a pit that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.280" end="01:18:31.410" style="s2">and that they decided that they were</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.920" end="01:18:36.330" style="s2">going to try to put their lives together</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.410" end="01:18:37.530" style="s2">and that it worked and so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.330" end="01:18:39.390" style="s2">something you know when they write</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.530" end="01:18:41.340" style="s2">surprised it&#39;s like well I decided that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.390" end="01:18:43.140" style="s2">I was gonna work hard at what I was</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.340" end="01:18:44.970" style="s2">doing and I wasn&#39;t gonna lie any more</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.140" end="01:18:46.890" style="s2">than absolutely necessary I thought I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.970" end="01:18:48.960" style="s2">give it a try for a few months you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.890" end="01:18:51.510" style="s2">and all sorts of good things started to</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.960" end="01:18:53.730" style="s2">happen to me it&#39;s like maybe that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.510" end="01:18:55.410" style="s2">the world works now obviously it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.730" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">work like that all the time right</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.410" end="01:18:58.860" style="s2">because you can get sliced off at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:01.530" style="s2">knees I mean there&#39;s an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.860" end="01:19:04.940" style="s2">element to existence that that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.530" end="01:19:08.940" style="s2">wish away but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.940" end="01:19:10.350" style="s2">there are it doesn&#39;t mean that there</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.940" end="01:19:14.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t bad strategies and good</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.350" end="01:19:15.600" style="s2">strategies and so I do think that one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.520" end="01:19:18.330" style="s2">the most fundamental existential</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.600" end="01:19:20.310" style="s2">questions is like if things aren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.330" end="01:19:21.630" style="s2">well for you and your life is are you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.310" end="01:19:23.580" style="s2">absolutely certain that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.630" end="01:19:25.410" style="s2">absolutely everything you can to put</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.580" end="01:19:27.480" style="s2">things in order because if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.410" end="01:19:28.950" style="s2">then you shouldn&#39;t complain because you</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.480" end="01:19:31.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know to what degree you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.950" end="01:19:33.300" style="s2">actually contributing or even causing</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.650" end="01:19:34.830" style="s2">the circumstance now that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.300" end="01:19:36.210" style="s2">annoying thing to think and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.830" end="01:19:37.740" style="s2">trying to blame the victim</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.210" end="01:19:39.420" style="s2">you know I know that people end up with</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.740" end="01:19:41.640" style="s2">lung cancer because they were exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.420" end="01:19:43.740" style="s2">asbestos you know and I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.640" end="01:19:45.180" style="s2">although I also know too that if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.740" end="01:19:47.100" style="s2">have lung cancer because you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.180" end="01:19:49.050" style="s2">exposed to asbestos that can be a</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.100" end="01:19:49.290" style="s2">tragedy or it can be hell and to some</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.050" end="01:19:51.060" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.290" end="01:19:53.730" style="s2">that depends on how you conduct yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.060" end="01:19:57.720" style="s2">so I mean I know that&#39;s pretty gloomy</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.730" end="01:19:59.930" style="s2">possibilities right but so anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.720" end="01:20:03.570" style="s2">Joseph is a slave but it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.930" end="01:20:04.980" style="s2">he&#39;s uh he hasn&#39;t sacrificed the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.570" end="01:20:07.320" style="s2">integrity of his character and so it</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.980" end="01:20:09.900" style="s2">turns out that being it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.320" end="01:20:11.880" style="s2">he&#39;s not a slave it&#39;s just that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.900" end="01:20:16.170" style="s2">around him thinks he&#39;s a slave but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.880" end="01:20:18.090" style="s2">not so that&#39;s pretty interesting he was</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.170" end="01:20:20.730" style="s2">a goodly person and well favored well so</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.090" end="01:20:23.880" style="s2">he&#39;s a good guy and he&#39;s an impressive</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.730" end="01:20:25.530" style="s2">specimen as well this is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.880" end="01:20:27.990" style="s2">interesting given the current political</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.530" end="01:20:29.910" style="s2">climate I would say and it came to pass</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.990" end="01:20:32.130" style="s2">after these things that his master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.910" end="01:20:35.250" style="s2">wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.130" end="01:20:38.460" style="s2">said lie with me that means that</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.250" end="01:20:45.060" style="s2">actually has two meanings right but he</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.460" end="01:20:49.020" style="s2">refused and said unto his master&#39;s wife</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.060" end="01:20:50.870" style="s2">behold my master does not know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.020" end="01:20:55.140" style="s2">with me in the house and he&#39;s committed</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.870" end="01:20:58.200" style="s2">all that he has to my hand there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.140" end="01:21:00.090" style="s2">one greater in this house than I neither</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.200" end="01:21:02.970" style="s2">hath he kept back anything for me but</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.090" end="01:21:04.550" style="s2">you because you are his wife how then</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.970" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">can I do this great wickedness</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.550" end="01:21:12.180" style="s2">wickedness and sin against God and it</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:14.160" style="s2">came to pass as she spake to Joseph day</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.180" end="01:21:16.680" style="s2">by day that he hearkened not unto her to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.160" end="01:21:19.590" style="s2">lie by her or be with her it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.680" end="01:21:22.770" style="s2">sexually harassed Joseph and it came to</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.590" end="01:21:31.530" style="s2">pass well its rounds right I mean look</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.770" end="01:21:33.210" style="s2">look at the painting and it came to pass</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.530" end="01:21:34.770" style="s2">about this time that Joseph went into</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.210" end="01:21:36.150" style="s2">the house to do his business and there</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.770" end="01:21:38.640" style="s2">was none of the men of the house there</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.150" end="01:21:41.370" style="s2">with in and she caught him by his</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.640" end="01:21:43.530" style="s2">garment saying lie with me and he left</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.370" end="01:21:46.050" style="s2">his garment in her hand and fled and got</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.530" end="01:21:48.060" style="s2">him out so that&#39;s so kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.050" end="01:21:51.450" style="s2">embarrassing for poor Joseph I would say</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.060" end="01:21:53.130" style="s2">and a bit on the suspicious side and it</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.450" end="01:21:54.900" style="s2">came to pass when she saw that he had</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.130" end="01:21:57.360" style="s2">left his garment in her hand and was</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.900" end="01:21:59.700" style="s2">fled forth that she called unto the men</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.360" end="01:22:01.560" style="s2">of her house and spake unto them see see</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.700" end="01:22:02.790" style="s2">he hath brought in a Hebrew to mark us</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.560" end="01:22:04.830" style="s2">he came in unto</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.790" end="01:22:09.000" style="s2">you lie with me and I cried with a loud</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.830" end="01:22:12.050" style="s2">voice so what is it hell hath no fury</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.000" end="01:22:14.580" style="s2">like a woman scorned that&#39;s the proper</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.050" end="01:22:16.230" style="s2">commentary on that and it came to pass</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.580" end="01:22:17.910" style="s2">when he heard that I lifted up my voice</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.230" end="01:22:21.150" style="s2">and cried that he left his garment with</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.910" end="01:22:22.950" style="s2">me and fled and got himself out and it</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.150" end="01:22:24.450" style="s2">came to pass when his master heard the</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.950" end="01:22:26.820" style="s2">words of his wife so that&#39;s the farro</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.450" end="01:22:29.430" style="s2">which she spake unto him saying after</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.820" end="01:22:31.380" style="s2">this manner did thy servant to me his</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.430" end="01:22:33.420" style="s2">wrath was kindled and joseph&#39;s master</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.380" end="01:22:35.430" style="s2">took him and put him in prison a place</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.420" end="01:22:37.320" style="s2">where the Kings prisoners were was were</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.430" end="01:22:41.130" style="s2">bound and he was there in the prison</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.320" end="01:22:43.230" style="s2">well that sort of sucks it&#39;s like first</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.130" end="01:22:45.540" style="s2">his brothers betray him and throw him in</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.230" end="01:22:46.980" style="s2">a pit and then he gets made a slave</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.540" end="01:22:49.020" style="s2">which is probably better than being in</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.980" end="01:22:50.850" style="s2">the pit and then he becomes sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.020" end="01:22:52.980" style="s2">King slaves so that&#39;s working out pretty</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.850" end="01:22:54.480" style="s2">well and now someone lies about him he</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.980" end="01:22:55.890" style="s2">gets betrayed again and now it&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.480" end="01:22:57.960" style="s2">the prison with him and so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.890" end="01:23:01.290" style="s2">it&#39;s this again right it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.960" end="01:23:04.550" style="s2">thing it&#39;s Sisyphus up with the rock and</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.290" end="01:23:07.260" style="s2">then down and it&#39;s order chaos order</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.550" end="01:23:09.180" style="s2">chaos and then you have to think well</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.260" end="01:23:11.120" style="s2">are you the order or you the chaos or</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.180" end="01:23:13.490" style="s2">you the thing that&#39;s moving between them</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:15.840" style="s2">because that&#39;s the right thing to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.490" end="01:23:17.580" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re just order and</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.840" end="01:23:19.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a really bad idea or you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.580" end="01:23:21.890" style="s2">chaos and that&#39;s a really bad idea you</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.830" end="01:23:24.600" style="s2">can be the thing that&#39;s dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.890" end="01:23:27.510" style="s2">mediating between them and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.600" end="01:23:29.460" style="s2">he&#39;s doing but the Lord was with Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.510" end="01:23:31.190" style="s2">and showed him mercy and gave him favor</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.460" end="01:23:34.020" style="s2">in the sight of the keeper of the prison</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.190" end="01:23:35.520" style="s2">that&#39;s no easy thing to do I would think</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.020" end="01:23:38.430" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re thrown in</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:40.040" style="s2">prison and now the jailer likes you now</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.430" end="01:23:42.300" style="s2">how exactly are you going to manage that</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.040" end="01:23:44.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing to think about because</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.300" end="01:23:45.810" style="s2">you might think well if you were really</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.040" end="01:23:47.760" style="s2">in dire straits how is it that you</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.810" end="01:23:49.950" style="s2">should conduct yourself so that you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.760" end="01:23:52.920" style="s2">the highest probability of having things</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.950" end="01:23:55.200" style="s2">work out and it&#39;s not saying well Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.920" end="01:23:56.670" style="s2">took over the thumbscrew you know and</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.200" end="01:23:58.830" style="s2">started using that on the other</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.670" end="01:24:00.180" style="s2">prisoners that that&#39;s not the indication</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.830" end="01:24:03.540" style="s2">here at all it&#39;s that he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.180" end="01:24:06.150" style="s2">something he&#39;s acting like a person who</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.540" end="01:24:07.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t a prisoner even though he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.150" end="01:24:09.060" style="s2">prison just like he was acting like</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.620" end="01:24:12.740" style="s2">someone who wasn&#39;t a slave when he was a</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.060" end="01:24:12.740" style="s2">slave and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.340" end="01:24:20.300" style="s2">it makes you wonder who you can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.099" end="01:24:22.429" style="s2">despite the fact that other people think</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.300" end="01:24:24.800" style="s2">that you&#39;re whatever you appear to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.429" end="01:24:26.869" style="s2">and the keeper of the prison committed</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:28.519" style="s2">to Joseph&#39;s hand all the prisoners that</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.869" end="01:24:30.469" style="s2">were in the prison and whatsoever they</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.519" end="01:24:31.820" style="s2">did there he was the doer of it the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.469" end="01:24:33.499" style="s2">keeper of the prison looked not to</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.820" end="01:24:34.969" style="s2">anything that was under his hand because</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.499" end="01:24:40.010" style="s2">the Lord was with him and that which he</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.969" end="01:24:42.650" style="s2">did the Lord made it to prosper so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.010" end="01:24:45.229" style="s2">a repeat its a repeat of exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.650" end="01:24:47.570" style="s2">happened when he was the slave of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.229" end="01:24:49.429" style="s2">Pharaoh except it&#39;s one rung deeper into</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.570" end="01:24:51.619" style="s2">hell so to speak right so it&#39;s slave</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.429" end="01:24:53.900" style="s2">Pharaoh and here it&#39;s prisoner jail</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.619" end="01:24:55.639" style="s2">master but it doesn&#39;t matter the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.900" end="01:24:57.619" style="s2">thing happens so now Joseph is</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.639" end="01:25:00.079" style="s2">imprisonment the Pharaoh has a fit one</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.619" end="01:25:01.820" style="s2">day of peak and throws the chief of his</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.079" end="01:25:04.190" style="s2">Butler&#39;s into prison and the chief of</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.820" end="01:25:08.479" style="s2">his Baker&#39;s and they have a dream</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.190" end="01:25:10.760" style="s2">each of them and Joseph interprets the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.479" end="01:25:15.110" style="s2">dreams seems to be something that he can</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.760" end="01:25:18.499" style="s2">do and he tells the butler that his</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.110" end="01:25:19.760" style="s2">dream means that the Pharaoh was going</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.499" end="01:25:22.309" style="s2">to forgive him and put him back in his</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.760" end="01:25:24.409" style="s2">position and he tells the baker that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.309" end="01:25:26.449" style="s2">Pharaoh isn&#39;t going to forgive him and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.409" end="01:25:29.179" style="s2">that he&#39;s going to take off his head and</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.449" end="01:25:31.219" style="s2">hang him in a tree which was rather</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.179" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">rough dream but that is what huh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.219" end="01:25:35.960" style="s2">what happens so anyways that the Baker</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:37.699" style="s2">or the butler goes free and Joseph says</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.960" end="01:25:41.030" style="s2">look you know maybe you could just keep</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.699" end="01:25:42.650" style="s2">in mind the fact that I did you a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.030" end="01:25:45.499" style="s2">a favor here and told you something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.650" end="01:25:48.849" style="s2">was accurate but the chief didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.499" end="01:25:55.789" style="s2">remember once he once he was freed</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.849" end="01:25:58.729" style="s2">interpreting dreams in prison and so now</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.789" end="01:26:00.229" style="s2">the Pharaoh has a dream and he actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.729" end="01:26:03.110" style="s2">has two dreams so it&#39;s another one of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.229" end="01:26:04.789" style="s2">those doubled motifs so the ideas these</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.110" end="01:26:07.969" style="s2">are really important dreams because they</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.789" end="01:26:10.729" style="s2">came in a pair and behold there came out</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.969" end="01:26:14.119" style="s2">of the river seven well-favored kind and</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.729" end="01:26:14.300" style="s2">fat flesh so cattle and they fed the men</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.119" end="01:26:17.119" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.300" end="01:26:19.239" style="s2">meadow and behold seven other cattle</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.119" end="01:26:22.130" style="s2">came up after the Mount of the river</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.239" end="01:26:24.650" style="s2">ill-favored and lean fleshed starving</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.130" end="01:26:26.690" style="s2">and stood by the other cows on the brink</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.650" end="01:26:27.740" style="s2">of the river and the ill-favored and</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.690" end="01:26:30.890" style="s2">lean flesh</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.740" end="01:26:34.340" style="s2">I did eat up the seven well-favored and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.890" end="01:26:37.280" style="s2">fat so Pharaoh awoke hey fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.340" end="01:26:41.060" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty nasty dream and then he has</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.280" end="01:26:42.680" style="s2">another dream to hit it home and he</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.060" end="01:26:45.050" style="s2">slept and dreamt the second time and</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.680" end="01:26:48.020" style="s2">behold seven years of corn came up upon</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.050" end="01:26:50.390" style="s2">one stalk rankin good and behold seven</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.020" end="01:26:52.670" style="s2">thin ears and blasted with the east wind</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.390" end="01:26:54.650" style="s2">sprung up after them and the seven thin</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.670" end="01:26:57.080" style="s2">ears devoured the seven rank and full</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.650" end="01:26:59.600" style="s2">ears and Pharaoh awoke and beheld it was</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.080" end="01:27:01.940" style="s2">a dream and then it says a little later</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.600" end="01:27:03.800" style="s2">and for that the dream was doubled unto</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.940" end="01:27:05.780" style="s2">Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.800" end="01:27:07.820" style="s2">established by God and God will shortly</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.780" end="01:27:09.890" style="s2">bring it to pass it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.820" end="01:27:12.530" style="s2">know because one of the better theories</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.890" end="01:27:14.030" style="s2">about dreams is that they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.530" end="01:27:16.040" style="s2">way that the right and left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.030" end="01:27:17.390" style="s2">communicate or maybe the nonverbal part</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.040" end="01:27:19.130" style="s2">of the brain communicates with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.390" end="01:27:23.690" style="s2">verbal brand verbal part of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.130" end="01:27:26.030" style="s2">and so the nonverbal part of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.690" end="01:27:27.740" style="s2">which is less differentiated and thinks</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.030" end="01:27:30.830" style="s2">more globally is looking for patterns</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.740" end="01:27:33.410" style="s2">and anomalies in the world things that</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.830" end="01:27:35.330" style="s2">don&#39;t fit well with the current way of</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.410" end="01:27:37.550" style="s2">conceptualizing the world things that</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.330" end="01:27:39.080" style="s2">make you anxious and uncertain and those</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.550" end="01:27:40.870" style="s2">are things you haven&#39;t mastered right so</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.080" end="01:27:42.680" style="s2">they don&#39;t fit well into your</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.870" end="01:27:44.900" style="s2">conceptualization of the world by</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.680" end="01:27:45.890" style="s2">definition because if you had mastered</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.900" end="01:27:49.160" style="s2">them they wouldn&#39;t make you anxious</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.890" end="01:27:50.600" style="s2">nervous and so the the nonverbal parts</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.160" end="01:27:52.160" style="s2">of your brain are like an alarm system</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.600" end="01:27:55.310" style="s2">they&#39;re looking around for places where</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.160" end="01:27:57.620" style="s2">you&#39;re probably wrong and then they put</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.310" end="01:28:00.440" style="s2">those in images and try to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.620" end="01:28:02.180" style="s2">them so that you can update your model</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.440" end="01:28:03.650" style="s2">of reality to take them into account but</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.180" end="01:28:06.620" style="s2">that also produces a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.650" end="01:28:12.500" style="s2">negative emotion especially at night and</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.620" end="01:28:14.030" style="s2">so so we know that we know if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.500" end="01:28:16.480" style="s2">deprive people of dreams that they go</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.030" end="01:28:19.520" style="s2">insane very rapidly animals as well</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.480" end="01:28:21.140" style="s2">necessary part of mental equilibrium the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.520" end="01:28:23.210" style="s2">way you do that with rats in case you</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.140" end="01:28:24.560" style="s2">want to know is that you&#39;ve got rats</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.210" end="01:28:25.280" style="s2">that you want to drive insane this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.560" end="01:28:29.060" style="s2">how you do it</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.280" end="01:28:31.160" style="s2">so you put the rat on a like a pedestal</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.060" end="01:28:33.350" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty small and then when you</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.160" end="01:28:35.510" style="s2">fall it&#39;s surrounded by water and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.350" end="01:28:37.130" style="s2">when he falls asleep his nose hits the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.510" end="01:28:39.170" style="s2">water then he wakes up and so you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.130" end="01:28:41.599" style="s2">deprive the rat of sleep and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.170" end="01:28:44.469" style="s2">doesn&#39;t the rats don&#39;t respond to</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.599" end="01:28:47.170" style="s2">very well after some period of time so</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.469" end="01:28:49.790" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the ways that that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.170" end="01:28:52.400" style="s2">discovered but anyways the dream does</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.790" end="01:28:54.739" style="s2">seem to be an update mechanism and so if</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.400" end="01:28:56.719" style="s2">if you have a very powerful dream like a</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.739" end="01:28:58.219" style="s2">nightmare especially if it&#39;s repeating</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.719" end="01:29:01.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like something is trying to hammer</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.219" end="01:29:02.989" style="s2">on the door that needs to be let in and</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.060" end="01:29:07.340" style="s2">often you don&#39;t know how to let it in</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.989" end="01:29:09.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a problem so but then</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.340" end="01:29:12.110" style="s2">Pharaoh sent and called Joseph because</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.170" end="01:29:13.400" style="s2">he had talked to his his Butler and they</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.110" end="01:29:15.079" style="s2">brought him hastily out of the dungeon</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.400" end="01:29:18.010" style="s2">and Joseph shaved himself and changed</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.079" end="01:29:20.270" style="s2">his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh I</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.010" end="01:29:21.829" style="s2">guess he didn&#39;t want a shark Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.270" end="01:29:23.929" style="s2">with how people dressed in the prison</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.829" end="01:29:25.310" style="s2">and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.929" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">dreamed a dream and there&#39;s none that</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.310" end="01:29:28.400" style="s2">can interpret it I&#39;ve heard say of thee</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:30.909" style="s2">that you could understand a dream to</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.400" end="01:29:34.280" style="s2">interpret it and Joseph said it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.909" end="01:29:37.040" style="s2">God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.280" end="01:29:39.469" style="s2">it&#39;s so Jacob isn&#39;t taking credit for</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.040" end="01:29:40.810" style="s2">his ability to interpret dreams which</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.469" end="01:29:44.030" style="s2">also indicates quite interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.810" end="01:29:45.800" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing that despite the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.030" end="01:29:48.320" style="s2">fact that he&#39;s successful incompetent</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.800" end="01:29:50.900" style="s2">he&#39;s not narcissistic like if he happens</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.320" end="01:29:52.699" style="s2">to have this gift he regards it as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.900" end="01:29:54.889" style="s2">gift and not as something that you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.699" end="01:29:56.900" style="s2">renounced his favor it&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.889" end="01:29:58.610" style="s2">that he happens to be able to do and so</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.900" end="01:30:00.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a hallmark of someone</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.610" end="01:30:02.210" style="s2">who&#39;s got a pretty well put-together</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.440" end="01:30:06.469" style="s2">personality as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.210" end="01:30:08.060" style="s2">because you know people have gifts that</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.469" end="01:30:10.280" style="s2">they didn&#39;t really earn those would be</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.060" end="01:30:11.810" style="s2">your talents your intelligence your good</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.280" end="01:30:15.440" style="s2">looks if you happen to have good looks</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.810" end="01:30:17.119" style="s2">etc and they&#39;re not there&#39;s no sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.440" end="01:30:19.250" style="s2">being all puffed up about that because</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.119" end="01:30:22.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s great it&#39;s luck of the draw</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.250" end="01:30:23.480" style="s2">though and the proper attitude is to</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.040" end="01:30:31.489" style="s2">note that it&#39;s luck of the draw to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.480" end="01:30:37.190" style="s2">grateful for it it&#39;s quite a fine</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.489" end="01:30:38.719" style="s2">painting that one behold there come</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.190" end="01:30:40.429" style="s2">seven years of great plenty throughout</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.719" end="01:30:42.199" style="s2">the island of Egypt and then there shall</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.429" end="01:30:43.579" style="s2">arise after them seven years of famine</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.199" end="01:30:45.170" style="s2">and all the plenty shall be forgotten</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.579" end="01:30:47.510" style="s2">and the famine shall consume the land</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.170" end="01:30:49.880" style="s2">and the Plenty shall not be known in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.510" end="01:30:54.320" style="s2">land by reason of that famine following</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.880" end="01:30:55.309" style="s2">issue for it shall be very Grievous so</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.320" end="01:30:57.109" style="s2">now we</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.309" end="01:30:58.879" style="s2">to that Jacob he can interpret dreams</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.109" end="01:31:01.010" style="s2">but he&#39;s also the sort of person who can</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.879" end="01:31:03.439" style="s2">look into the future and think this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.010" end="01:31:05.629" style="s2">sort of what Adam was called on to do</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.439" end="01:31:07.399" style="s2">when he got kicked out of the garden of</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.629" end="01:31:09.289" style="s2">paradise is you&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.399" end="01:31:11.599" style="s2">conceptualize that even if things are</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.289" end="01:31:12.829" style="s2">going well now that that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.599" end="01:31:16.099" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to go well into the</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.829" end="01:31:18.109" style="s2">future and so he&#39;s the aunt and not the</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.099" end="01:31:19.609" style="s2">grasshopper right in the grasshopper and</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.109" end="01:31:22.010" style="s2">the ant story it&#39;s like everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.609" end="01:31:24.169" style="s2">good but you should wake the hell up and</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.010" end="01:31:26.239" style="s2">you should test to see how things can go</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.169" end="01:31:30.039" style="s2">wrong and you can see if your systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.239" end="01:31:32.809" style="s2">can survive them things going wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.039" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">which is something that I think we could</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.809" end="01:31:36.289" style="s2">all hearken to because I think we do a</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:37.939" style="s2">very bad job in the modern world of</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.289" end="01:31:43.760" style="s2">testing to see if our systems can go</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.939" end="01:31:45.439" style="s2">wrong okay so the Pharaoh was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.760" end="01:31:46.760" style="s2">impressed by this dream interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.439" end="01:31:48.379" style="s2">and pretty worried about it and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.760" end="01:31:50.929" style="s2">he&#39;s a reasonable person despite the</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.379" end="01:31:53.689" style="s2">fact that he put Joseph in jail I guess</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.929" end="01:31:56.149" style="s2">he didn&#39;t have much choice now therefore</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.689" end="01:31:58.129" style="s2">let Pharaoh look for a man dis discreet</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.149" end="01:32:00.229" style="s2">and wise and set him over the land of</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.129" end="01:32:01.909" style="s2">Egypt let Pharaoh do this and let him</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.229" end="01:32:03.949" style="s2">appoint officers over the land this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.909" end="01:32:06.469" style="s2">what Joseph is saying and take up the</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.949" end="01:32:11.239" style="s2">fifth part of the land of Egypt in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.469" end="01:32:12.439" style="s2">seven plenteous years and let them</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.239" end="01:32:14.119" style="s2">gather all the food of those good years</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.439" end="01:32:15.979" style="s2">that come and lay up corn under the hand</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.119" end="01:32:20.179" style="s2">of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.979" end="01:32:24.649" style="s2">cities and just like that Joseph is</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.179" end="01:32:26.269" style="s2">restored to his position so Pharaoh said</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.649" end="01:32:28.129" style="s2">unto Joseph I am Pharaoh and without</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.269" end="01:32:30.109" style="s2">thee shall no man lift up his hand or</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.129" end="01:32:34.519" style="s2">foot in all of the land of Egypt and so</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.109" end="01:32:37.280" style="s2">he comes out of the prison and he really</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.519" end="01:32:38.719" style="s2">in some sense as far as I&#39;m concerned he</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.280" end="01:32:40.280" style="s2">actually occupies a position that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.719" end="01:32:41.749" style="s2">higher than the position of the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.280" end="01:32:43.399" style="s2">depends on how you look at it because</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.749" end="01:32:46.429" style="s2">the Pharaoh has relegated himself to</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.399" end="01:32:47.780" style="s2">ceremonial status right Joseph has all</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.429" end="01:32:50.739" style="s2">the responsibilities makes all the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.780" end="01:32:53.269" style="s2">decisions so de-facto he&#39;s the pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.739" end="01:32:54.679" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t get the glory precisely</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.269" end="01:32:56.959" style="s2">although he&#39;s not doing too bad for</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.679" end="01:33:00.559" style="s2">himself not there&#39;s a lesson in that too</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.959" end="01:33:02.809" style="s2">I wrote these rules for Quora a long</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.559" end="01:33:04.399" style="s2">time ago and one of them I&#39;ve written</p>

<p begin="01:33:06.169" end="01:33:09.020" style="s2">one of the rules that I didn&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.760" end="01:33:12.140" style="s2">about was</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.020" end="01:33:14.180" style="s2">um note that responsive note that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.140" end="01:33:16.610" style="s2">opportunity lurks where responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.180" end="01:33:18.890" style="s2">has been abdicated which is really</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.610" end="01:33:20.720" style="s2">interesting I think I mean I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.890" end="01:33:22.550" style="s2">people in their jobs they say things</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.720" end="01:33:25.490" style="s2">like well my the guy I work with doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.550" end="01:33:27.800" style="s2">do any work it&#39;s like well you could do</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.490" end="01:33:30.050" style="s2">it I mean I know there&#39;s limits to that</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.800" end="01:33:32.330" style="s2">but one of the things you can do at work</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.050" end="01:33:34.850" style="s2">is make yourself indispensable I mean</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.330" end="01:33:36.980" style="s2">you might get the cane types against you</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.850" end="01:33:38.690" style="s2">if you do that but there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.980" end="01:33:41.390" style="s2">be said for being indispensable because</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.690" end="01:33:43.580" style="s2">when people start to be dispensed with</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.390" end="01:33:45.590" style="s2">you probably won&#39;t be one of them or</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.580" end="01:33:47.030" style="s2">even if you are then the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.590" end="01:33:48.350" style="s2">you&#39;re indispensable just means you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.030" end="01:33:53.120" style="s2">go somewhere else and be indispensable</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.350" end="01:33:56.510" style="s2">there and that&#39;s just as useful so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.120" end="01:33:59.000" style="s2">very very difficult to permanently put</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.510" end="01:34:01.160" style="s2">down someone who&#39;s really good at doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.000" end="01:34:03.320" style="s2">things because they can just go off and</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.160" end="01:34:05.680" style="s2">do them somewhere else and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.320" end="01:34:08.300" style="s2">ways that you get like that is to take</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.680" end="01:34:10.340" style="s2">responsibility when someone else is</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.300" end="01:34:11.900" style="s2">failing to do so and you think well I</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.340" end="01:34:13.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have to do that that&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.900" end="01:34:15.230" style="s2">of thinking about it another way of</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.370" end="01:34:19.460" style="s2">thinking about it is oh good I get to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.230" end="01:34:21.230" style="s2">that and the seven years of plenty estas</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.460" end="01:34:22.760" style="s2">that was in the land of Egypt were ended</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.230" end="01:34:26.440" style="s2">and the seven years of dearth began to</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.760" end="01:34:29.650" style="s2">come according as joseph has said and</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.440" end="01:34:33.110" style="s2">the dearth was in all the lands well</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.650" end="01:34:34.730" style="s2">that&#39;s an archetypal story right in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.110" end="01:34:37.580" style="s2">archetypal story it&#39;s the business cycle</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.730" end="01:34:39.410" style="s2">story it&#39;s a little harsher when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.580" end="01:34:42.110" style="s2">starving obviously but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.410" end="01:34:43.340" style="s2">point the point is is that sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.110" end="01:34:46.370" style="s2">things are getting good and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.340" end="01:34:48.110" style="s2">things are getting bad and that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.370" end="01:34:50.420" style="s2">can be sure that that&#39;s the case that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.110" end="01:34:53.690" style="s2">gonna happen to you and so the wise</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.420" end="01:34:55.850" style="s2">person takes stock of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.690" end="01:34:57.740" style="s2">things are going to get bad is this is</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.850" end="01:35:00.920" style="s2">the same thing that happens with Noah</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.740" end="01:35:03.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like assume the flood cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.920" end="01:35:04.550" style="s2">gonna happen and you think well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.080" end="01:35:08.270" style="s2">hell of a world that has floods it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.550" end="01:35:09.830" style="s2">like not if you have a boat right it it</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.270" end="01:35:11.450" style="s2">helps a lot if you if there&#39;s a flood</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.830" end="01:35:13.430" style="s2">and you have a boat it&#39;s like you can</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.450" end="01:35:18.470" style="s2">float on the flood and then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.430" end="01:35:21.470" style="s2">such a problem and so if you refuse to</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.470" end="01:35:23.519" style="s2">look not the fact that things are going</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.470" end="01:35:25.530" style="s2">to be going downhill bad</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.519" end="01:35:27.869" style="s2">and that you&#39;re going to be in a pit at</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.530" end="01:35:31.559" style="s2">some point you and your family perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.869" end="01:35:34.460" style="s2">then when it happens it will be as bad</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.559" end="01:35:38.150" style="s2">as it possibly can be but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.460" end="01:35:44.670" style="s2">awake and alert to that possibility then</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.150" end="01:35:45.960" style="s2">you can mitigate it and the dearth was</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.670" end="01:35:49.079" style="s2">in all the lands but in the land of</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.960" end="01:35:50.699" style="s2">Egypt there was bread and when the land</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.079" end="01:35:52.409" style="s2">of Egypt was famished the people cried</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.699" end="01:35:54.960" style="s2">to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.409" end="01:35:57.780" style="s2">unto the Egyptians go to Joseph what he</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.960" end="01:35:59.130" style="s2">says to you to do you do that and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.780" end="01:36:00.989" style="s2">famine was all over the face of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.130" end="01:36:02.849" style="s2">earth and Joe Joseph opened up the</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.989" end="01:36:05.429" style="s2">storehouses and sold to the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.849" end="01:36:06.989" style="s2">and the famine waxed sore in the land of</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.429" end="01:36:10.679" style="s2">Egypt and all the countries came into</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.989" end="01:36:12.929" style="s2">Egypt to buy to Joseph to buy corn</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.679" end="01:36:16.590" style="s2">because the famine was sore in all the</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.929" end="01:36:19.280" style="s2">lands now when Jacob saw that there was</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.590" end="01:36:21.749" style="s2">corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.280" end="01:36:22.320" style="s2">why are you standing around looking at</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.749" end="01:36:24.239" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.320" end="01:36:28.199" style="s2">he said I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s corn in</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.239" end="01:36:30.510" style="s2">Egypt get down there and buy from by for</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.199" end="01:36:33.320" style="s2">us so that we may live and not die it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.510" end="01:36:35.820" style="s2">a pretty straightforward advice that and</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.320" end="01:36:38.849" style="s2">Joseph&#39;s ten brothers went down to buy</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.820" end="01:36:40.679" style="s2">corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.849" end="01:36:42.869" style="s2">brother so that&#39;s the youngest one right</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.679" end="01:36:44.489" style="s2">the only one left it&#39;s the one that was</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.869" end="01:36:47.849" style="s2">younger than Joseph the only youngest</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.489" end="01:36:49.829" style="s2">one and also rachel&#39;s other son but Jeb</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.849" end="01:36:52.789" style="s2">Benjamin Joseph&#39;s brother Jacob didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.829" end="01:36:55.019" style="s2">send because he was worried that</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.789" end="01:36:57.659" style="s2">something bad would happen to him which</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.019" end="01:36:59.309" style="s2">kind of indicates to me that maybe Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.659" end="01:37:01.739" style="s2">was a bit suspicious about what had</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.309" end="01:37:05.789" style="s2">happened to Joseph the last time he sent</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.739" end="01:37:07.409" style="s2">all the brothers on a adventure and</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.789" end="01:37:10.110" style="s2">Joseph was the governor over all the</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.409" end="01:37:11.519" style="s2">land and and he it was that sold to all</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.110" end="01:37:13.230" style="s2">the people of the land and Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.519" end="01:37:15.030" style="s2">brothers came and bowed down themselves</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.230" end="01:37:19.199" style="s2">before him with their faces to the earth</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.030" end="01:37:23.340" style="s2">well there&#39;s the dream now the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.199" end="01:37:24.960" style="s2">too is that one question you have in</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.340" end="01:37:28.139" style="s2">your life is who should you bow down to</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.960" end="01:37:29.699" style="s2">and you might say no one that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.139" end="01:37:31.110" style="s2">exactly the right answer because that</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.699" end="01:37:32.670" style="s2">means that you don&#39;t have an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.110" end="01:37:34.590" style="s2">because you bow down to your ideal</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.670" end="01:37:35.909" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes it an ideal and if you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.590" end="01:37:36.220" style="s2">don&#39;t have an ideal then what the hell</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.909" end="01:37:38.350" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.220" end="01:37:40.950" style="s2">do so you have to bow down to something</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.350" end="01:37:43.360" style="s2">and so what happens here is well</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.950" end="01:37:45.220" style="s2">the brothers are bowing down to the</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.360" end="01:37:46.750" style="s2">person who&#39;s so bloody resilient and</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.220" end="01:37:48.490" style="s2">competent that they can take themselves</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.750" end="01:37:50.500" style="s2">out of a prison and become the ruler of</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.490" end="01:37:52.630" style="s2">the land that happened to vaclav havel</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.500" end="01:37:56.710" style="s2">right in czechoslovakia it also happened</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.630" end="01:37:58.780" style="s2">to Mandela in South Africa like these</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.710" end="01:37:59.740" style="s2">things actually happen it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.780" end="01:38:01.330" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.740" end="01:38:08.020" style="s2">so you god only knows what you might</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.330" end="01:38:10.990" style="s2">learn in prison so so they bow down to</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.020" end="01:38:13.330" style="s2">Joseph and properly so you know he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.990" end="01:38:15.760" style="s2">is even without his coat he&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.330" end="01:38:17.590" style="s2">person with the coat of many colors and</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.760" end="01:38:19.450" style="s2">Joseph saw his brothers and he knew them</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.590" end="01:38:21.340" style="s2">but he made them so strange unto them</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.450" end="01:38:22.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a number of years have passed and</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.340" end="01:38:24.580" style="s2">he spoke roughly unto them and he said</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.870" end="01:38:27.010" style="s2">unto them where do you come from and</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.580" end="01:38:29.680" style="s2">they said from the land of Canaan to buy</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.010" end="01:38:34.600" style="s2">food and Joseph knew whose brothers were</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.680" end="01:38:36.970" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t know who he was and they</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.600" end="01:38:39.340" style="s2">came back to Jacob their father and told</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.970" end="01:38:40.960" style="s2">him all that befell him and said the man</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.340" end="01:38:42.520" style="s2">whose Lord of the country spoke roughly</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.960" end="01:38:46.200" style="s2">to us and took us for spies</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.520" end="01:38:48.790" style="s2">and we said to him where were true men</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.200" end="01:38:51.250" style="s2">honest men we&#39;re not spies we be twelve</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.790" end="01:38:53.950" style="s2">brothers sons of our fathers one is not</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.250" end="01:38:57.090" style="s2">and the youngest is this day with our</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.950" end="01:38:59.950" style="s2">Father in the land of Canaan and the man</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.090" end="01:39:01.570" style="s2">said here&#39;s how I&#39;ll know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.950" end="01:39:04.030" style="s2">honest men leave one of the brothers</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.570" end="01:39:05.560" style="s2">here with me and take some food for the</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.030" end="01:39:07.540" style="s2">famine of your households and be gone</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.560" end="01:39:10.540" style="s2">and then bring your youngest brother to</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.540" end="01:39:12.160" style="s2">me then I&#39;ll know that you&#39;re not spies</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.540" end="01:39:14.590" style="s2">but that you&#39;re honest men and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.160" end="01:39:17.080" style="s2">deliver the other brother and he shall</p>

<p begin="01:39:17.080" end="01:39:20.650" style="s2">starve to death and it came to pass as</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.090" end="01:39:23.020" style="s2">they emptied their sacks that behold</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.650" end="01:39:25.030" style="s2">every man&#39;s bundle of money was in his</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.020" end="01:39:26.350" style="s2">sock and when both they and their father</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.030" end="01:39:27.160" style="s2">saw the bundles of money they were</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.350" end="01:39:30.160" style="s2">afraid so</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.160" end="01:39:31.330" style="s2">they had bought food from Joseph and he</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.160" end="01:39:34.270" style="s2">gave them the food and then he put all</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.330" end="01:39:35.710" style="s2">their money back and their socks which I</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.270" end="01:39:39.160" style="s2">could imagine would worry them to some</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.710" end="01:39:41.080" style="s2">degree and Jacob said me you have</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.160" end="01:39:42.970" style="s2">already believed of my children Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.080" end="01:39:45.460" style="s2">is not as Simeon is not now you&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.970" end="01:39:48.160" style="s2">Benjamin Benjamin away all these things</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.460" end="01:39:50.080" style="s2">are against me and Reuben spake unto his</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.160" end="01:39:51.970" style="s2">father saying slay my two sons if</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.080" end="01:39:53.260" style="s2">bring him not to thee deliver him into</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.970" end="01:39:57.610" style="s2">my hand and I will bring him to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.260" end="01:39:59.170" style="s2">again and he and he said no my son shall</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.610" end="01:40:00.910" style="s2">not go down with you for his brother is</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.170" end="01:40:03.790" style="s2">dead and he&#39;s left alone if mischief</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.910" end="01:40:05.350" style="s2">befall him by the way in the which you</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.790" end="01:40:07.030" style="s2">shall go then you shall bring down my</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.350" end="01:40:10.510" style="s2">great gray hairs with sorrow to the</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.030" end="01:40:12.220" style="s2">grave now there&#39;s a hint see what</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.510" end="01:40:14.410" style="s2">happens in the last part of the Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.220" end="01:40:17.290" style="s2">storage the Joseph&#39;s story is and this</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.410" end="01:40:18.790" style="s2">is associated with the idea of putting</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.290" end="01:40:20.020" style="s2">your house in order your individual</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.790" end="01:40:21.490" style="s2">house in order and then putting your</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.020" end="01:40:23.440" style="s2">family&#39;s house in order let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.490" end="01:40:25.540" style="s2">reversed a little bit in this story</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.440" end="01:40:28.960" style="s2">because Joseph puts himself together and</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.540" end="01:40:30.070" style="s2">then he puts the state of Egypt in order</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.960" end="01:40:32.320" style="s2">which is really quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.070" end="01:40:34.930" style="s2">because Egypt is the canonical tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.320" end="01:40:37.150" style="s2">right in the Old Testament and so the</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.930" end="01:40:39.310" style="s2">idea is very very clear here that the</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.150" end="01:40:42.310" style="s2">person who wears the coat of many colors</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.310" end="01:40:44.080" style="s2">can put the tyranny right and then the</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.310" end="01:40:46.030" style="s2">next extension is well he has to put his</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.080" end="01:40:47.470" style="s2">family right now you know generally the</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.030" end="01:40:49.240" style="s2">progression would be put yourself right</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.470" end="01:40:50.800" style="s2">then put your family right then put the</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.240" end="01:40:52.420" style="s2">state right something like that it</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.800" end="01:40:53.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really hit if you can do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.420" end="01:40:57.580" style="s2">different order that&#39;s probably ok too</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.950" end="01:41:01.600" style="s2">but so so that&#39;s what happens at the end</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.580" end="01:41:03.250" style="s2">of the story is that you know Joseph is</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.600" end="01:41:05.320" style="s2">doing pretty damn well and so is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.250" end="01:41:07.810" style="s2">state that he serves but that isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.320" end="01:41:10.740" style="s2">enough for him he wants his family to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.810" end="01:41:13.630" style="s2">functional and put together properly</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.740" end="01:41:16.450" style="s2">even though they did terrible things to</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.630" end="01:41:18.970" style="s2">him and that&#39;s very interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.450" end="01:41:21.460" style="s2">once someone does terrible things to you</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.970" end="01:41:23.410" style="s2">then the logical thing or a logical</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.460" end="01:41:25.780" style="s2">thing to think is well go to hell in a</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.410" end="01:41:32.320" style="s2">handbasket you know like you deserve</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.780" end="01:41:34.570" style="s2">exactly what you get but it&#39;s not a very</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.320" end="01:41:36.390" style="s2">productive attitude especially if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.570" end="01:41:40.440" style="s2">around people that you have to be around</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.390" end="01:41:42.940" style="s2">you know so like if it&#39;s your family and</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.440" end="01:41:44.140" style="s2">you go have a family dinner and one of</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.940" end="01:41:45.640" style="s2">you punches the other and then the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.140" end="01:41:47.170" style="s2">punches you back and then that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.640" end="01:41:49.240" style="s2">the family dinner for the next thirty</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.170" end="01:41:50.770" style="s2">years it doesn&#39;t seem to be very</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.240" end="01:41:53.020" style="s2">productive even if you&#39;re the person who</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.770" end="01:41:54.820" style="s2">happened to get in the last blow because</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.020" end="01:41:57.670" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to put up with them at</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.820" end="01:42:00.540" style="s2">minimum it might be nice to just let</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.670" end="01:42:03.160" style="s2">what you can go go and work to make</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.540" end="01:42:04.990" style="s2">towards making things better</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.160" end="01:42:06.760" style="s2">have to get rid of the idea of revenge</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.990" end="01:42:13.300" style="s2">and resentment and all those things that</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.760" end="01:42:14.800" style="s2">you carry along but but it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.300" end="01:42:16.660" style="s2">better to think about how your family</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.800" end="01:42:19.330" style="s2">could be if it was really functioning</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.660" end="01:42:22.570" style="s2">well and then just a money Ringley at</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.330" end="01:42:26.020" style="s2">that no no that&#39;s not easy I mean people</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.570" end="01:42:28.990" style="s2">are very screw in there&#39;s no end to the</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.020" end="01:42:31.600" style="s2">depths of Pathology within families but</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.990" end="01:42:34.360" style="s2">of course this story states that very</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.600" end="01:42:37.090" style="s2">clearly I mean they tried to kill him</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.360" end="01:42:39.010" style="s2">they&#39;ve sold him into slavery it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.090" end="01:42:43.600" style="s2">a pathological family let&#39;s put it that</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.010" end="01:42:46.240" style="s2">way and but Joseph&#39;s attitude is well we</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.600" end="01:42:47.980" style="s2">got to set this right not least because</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.240" end="01:42:49.690" style="s2">of his father but it isn&#39;t only because</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.980" end="01:42:51.880" style="s2">of his father as you see and as the</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.690" end="01:42:53.980" style="s2">story unfolds and the famine was sore in</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.880" end="01:42:55.360" style="s2">the land and it came to pass when they</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.980" end="01:42:56.770" style="s2">had eaten up the corn which they had</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.360" end="01:42:59.020" style="s2">brought out of Egypt their father said</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.770" end="01:43:03.340" style="s2">unto them go again and buy us a little</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.020" end="01:43:05.500" style="s2">food and Judah spake unto him saying the</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.340" end="01:43:07.300" style="s2">man did solemnly protest unto us you not</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.500" end="01:43:08.680" style="s2">see you will not see my face except your</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.300" end="01:43:12.130" style="s2">brother be with you they can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.680" end="01:43:15.070" style="s2">to Egypt without Benjamin and they said</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.130" end="01:43:16.660" style="s2">the man asked us straightly of our state</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.070" end="01:43:18.490" style="s2">and of her kindred saying is your father</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.660" end="01:43:20.350" style="s2">yet alive have you another brother and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.490" end="01:43:23.200" style="s2">we told him according to the tenor of</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.350" end="01:43:25.240" style="s2">those words could we know that he would</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.200" end="01:43:27.820" style="s2">say bring your brother down and Judah</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.240" end="01:43:29.680" style="s2">said unto Israel his father send the</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.820" end="01:43:31.870" style="s2">loud with me and will arise and go that</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.680" end="01:43:33.730" style="s2">we may live and not die both we and vow</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.870" end="01:43:36.940" style="s2">and also our little ones I will be</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.730" end="01:43:38.830" style="s2">surety for him my hand shall they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.940" end="01:43:40.870" style="s2">require him if I bring him not unto thee</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.830" end="01:43:45.670" style="s2">and set them before thee then let me</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.870" end="01:43:47.710" style="s2">bear the blame forever well so Judah who</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.670" end="01:43:51.190" style="s2">played a pretty dismal role in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.710" end="01:43:53.500" style="s2">original selling Joseph into slavery</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.190" end="01:43:55.210" style="s2">seems to obviously have learned</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.500" end="01:43:57.820" style="s2">something by this point since he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.210" end="01:43:59.350" style="s2">willing to put himself on the line you</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.820" end="01:44:01.030" style="s2">know to take responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.350" end="01:44:03.760" style="s2">situation and to put himself on the line</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.030" end="01:44:06.190" style="s2">and to stand in for Benjamin so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.760" end="01:44:12.630" style="s2">making himself into a sacrificial object</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.190" end="01:44:13.830" style="s2">of sorts and so the game that</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.630" end="01:44:15.840" style="s2">Joseph&#39;s playing cuz he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.830" end="01:44:17.460" style="s2">teasing his brothers but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.840" end="01:44:19.980" style="s2">testing them the game that he&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.460" end="01:44:21.420" style="s2">is tuefel is one is have you bloody well</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.980" end="01:44:22.949" style="s2">learned anything or are you just as</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.420" end="01:44:24.989" style="s2">corrupt and useless as you were before</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.949" end="01:44:27.630" style="s2">that&#39;s game number one in game number</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.989" end="01:44:29.639" style="s2">two is maybe if I poke and prod you and</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.630" end="01:44:31.889" style="s2">put you into a relatively difficult and</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.639" end="01:44:34.020" style="s2">mysterious situation I can get you to</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.889" end="01:44:35.610" style="s2">clue the hell in and the Dorp some</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.020" end="01:44:38.010" style="s2">responsibilities and we can move this</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.610" end="01:44:40.889" style="s2">whole mess forward and so that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.010" end="01:44:42.570" style="s2">be happening so Judah is taking</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.889" end="01:44:44.070" style="s2">responsibility and Reuben did that as</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.570" end="01:44:45.480" style="s2">well and the men took presence and they</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.070" end="01:44:47.159" style="s2">took double money in their hand and</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.480" end="01:44:50.070" style="s2">Benjamin and rose up and went down to</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.159" end="01:44:52.050" style="s2">Egypt and stood before Joseph and when</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.070" end="01:44:53.670" style="s2">Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.050" end="01:44:57.060" style="s2">the ruler of his house bring these men</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.670" end="01:44:58.650" style="s2">home and slay and make ready food for</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.060" end="01:45:00.929" style="s2">these men shall dine with me at noon and</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.650" end="01:45:03.170" style="s2">the men man did as Joseph bade and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.929" end="01:45:05.400" style="s2">man brought the men into Joseph&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.170" end="01:45:06.840" style="s2">and when Joseph came home they brought</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.400" end="01:45:10.530" style="s2">him the presents which was in their hand</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.840" end="01:45:13.080" style="s2">and bowed themselves again to him to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.530" end="01:45:14.790" style="s2">earth and he asked them of their welfare</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.080" end="01:45:17.370" style="s2">and said is your father well the old man</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.790" end="01:45:19.650" style="s2">of whom you spake is whom you spake is</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.370" end="01:45:21.480" style="s2">he yet alive and they answered thy</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.650" end="01:45:23.670" style="s2">servant our Father is in good health</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.480" end="01:45:29.580" style="s2">he&#39;s yet alive and they bowed down their</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.670" end="01:45:31.290" style="s2">heads and made obeisance and he lifted</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.580" end="01:45:34.350" style="s2">up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.290" end="01:45:36.000" style="s2">his mother&#39;s son and said is this your</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.350" end="01:45:38.670" style="s2">younger brother of whom you spake unto</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.000" end="01:45:42.000" style="s2">me and he said God be gracious unto thee</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.670" end="01:45:44.670" style="s2">my son and Joseph made haste for his</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.000" end="01:45:47.429" style="s2">bowels did yearn upon his brother and he</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.670" end="01:45:48.929" style="s2">saw it where to weep and he entered into</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.429" end="01:45:50.370" style="s2">his chamber and wept there and he washed</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.929" end="01:45:52.880" style="s2">his face and went out and refrained</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.370" end="01:45:55.409" style="s2">himself and said set on the bread and</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.880" end="01:45:57.239" style="s2">they sat before them now he plays</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.409" end="01:45:58.679" style="s2">another trick on his brother so he has</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.239" end="01:46:01.739" style="s2">them all sit at the table but he lines</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.679" end="01:46:05.610" style="s2">them up according to age and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.739" end="01:46:08.699" style="s2">trying to what is he trying to do start</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.610" end="01:46:10.350" style="s2">to freak them out fundamentally and so</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.699" end="01:46:11.940" style="s2">it and he manages that because they have</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.350" end="01:46:13.500" style="s2">no idea how in the world they could</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.940" end="01:46:14.820" style="s2">possibly he could possibly pull</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.500" end="01:46:17.280" style="s2">something like that off they think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.820" end="01:46:20.070" style="s2">magic and the men marvelled at one</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.280" end="01:46:22.380" style="s2">another and he took and sent messes unto</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.070" end="01:46:24.239" style="s2">them from before him but Benjamin&#39;s mess</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.380" end="01:46:26.310" style="s2">was five times as much as any of theirs</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.239" end="01:46:28.800" style="s2">so what&#39;s he doing</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.310" end="01:46:32.400" style="s2">well he&#39;s testing his brothers again the</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.800" end="01:46:35.610" style="s2">fact that when he was the child Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.400" end="01:46:37.440" style="s2">that he got more meant that his brothers</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.610" end="01:46:39.090" style="s2">got terribly jealous and then murderous</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.440" end="01:46:40.860" style="s2">right and so now he&#39;s doing the same</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.090" end="01:46:43.410" style="s2">thing with Benjamin he&#39;s thinking okay</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.860" end="01:46:48.330" style="s2">well I&#39;ll give this kid more mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.410" end="01:46:50.640" style="s2">then he is share you know what how these</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.330" end="01:46:54.450" style="s2">reprobates behave and see if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.640" end="01:46:56.070" style="s2">learned anything and so and he commanded</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.450" end="01:46:57.690" style="s2">the steward of his house saying fill the</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.070" end="01:46:59.850" style="s2">men&#39;s sock with food as much as they can</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.690" end="01:47:02.280" style="s2">carry and put every money man&#39;s money in</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.850" end="01:47:03.930" style="s2">the sock as well and put my cup the</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.280" end="01:47:07.260" style="s2">silver cup in the sacks mouth of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.930" end="01:47:08.580" style="s2">youngest and his corn money and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.260" end="01:47:10.200" style="s2">steward did according to the word that</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.580" end="01:47:12.360" style="s2">Joseph had spoken as soon as the morning</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.200" end="01:47:19.290" style="s2">was light the men were sent away along</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.360" end="01:47:20.910" style="s2">with their transportation the cup is</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.290" end="01:47:27.210" style="s2">found in Benjamin&#39;s sack well so</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.910" end="01:47:29.670" style="s2">Benjamin is kind of young and Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.210" end="01:47:30.780" style="s2">sends out people to find out where the</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.670" end="01:47:33.780" style="s2">cup has gone and they find it in</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.780" end="01:47:37.620" style="s2">Benjamin&#39;s in Benjamin&#39;s sock and</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.780" end="01:47:39.360" style="s2">they&#39;re very upset about this they said</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.620" end="01:47:42.210" style="s2">that a harsh punishment would befall</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.360" end="01:47:43.800" style="s2">whoever had the cup in his sock they</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.210" end="01:47:45.480" style="s2">rent their clothes and laid it every man</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.800" end="01:47:47.760" style="s2">his house and returned to this city and</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.480" end="01:47:49.230" style="s2">Judah and his brethren came to Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.760" end="01:47:50.670" style="s2">house for he was they yet there and they</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.230" end="01:47:53.820" style="s2">fell before him on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.670" end="01:47:55.740" style="s2">very unhappy and apologetic and Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.820" end="01:47:58.350" style="s2">said unto them what deed is this that</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.740" end="01:48:01.380" style="s2">you have done ha ha ha don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.350" end="01:48:04.170" style="s2">that a man like I can certainly divine I</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.380" end="01:48:06.330" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on and Judah said what</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.170" end="01:48:08.280" style="s2">shall we say what shall we speak or how</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.330" end="01:48:10.530" style="s2">can we possibly clear ourselves God</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.280" end="01:48:12.960" style="s2">found out the iniquity of thy servants</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.530" end="01:48:16.950" style="s2">behold we are your servants both we and</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.960" end="01:48:19.920" style="s2">also he with whom the cup is found and</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.950" end="01:48:23.700" style="s2">he said God forbid that I should do so</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.920" end="01:48:25.200" style="s2">but the man in whose cup and whose hand</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.700" end="01:48:27.810" style="s2">the cup has found he shall be my servant</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.200" end="01:48:32.340" style="s2">and as for you get you up in peace to</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.810" end="01:48:34.550" style="s2">your father it&#39;s the discovery of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.340" end="01:48:34.550" style="s2">cup</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.830" end="01:48:43.370" style="s2">Judis says now therefore when I come to</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.390" end="01:48:45.140" style="s2">this servant thy father my father and</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.370" end="01:48:47.480" style="s2">the loud be not with us and seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.140" end="01:48:49.310" style="s2">his life is bound up in the lads life it</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.480" end="01:48:52.330" style="s2">shall come to pass when he sees that the</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.310" end="01:48:54.590" style="s2">lad is not with us that he will die and</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.330" end="01:48:56.180" style="s2">the servants shall bring down the gray</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.590" end="01:48:58.100" style="s2">hairs of thy servant or father with</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.180" end="01:49:00.710" style="s2">sorrow to the grave for thy servant</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.100" end="01:49:03.020" style="s2">became surety for the lad unto my father</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.710" end="01:49:04.760" style="s2">saying if I bring him not unto thee then</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.020" end="01:49:08.360" style="s2">I shall bear the blame to my father</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.760" end="01:49:11.930" style="s2">forever now therefore I pray thee let me</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.360" end="01:49:13.760" style="s2">stay instead of the lad and let the lad</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.930" end="01:49:15.980" style="s2">go with his brothers for how shall I go</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.760" end="01:49:16.900" style="s2">up to my brother and the loud be not</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.980" end="01:49:19.490" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.900" end="01:49:22.130" style="s2">lest peradventure I shall see the evil</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.490" end="01:49:23.830" style="s2">that will come on my father ok so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.130" end="01:49:28.070" style="s2">happened well they learned a lesson</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.830" end="01:49:30.440" style="s2">so now Judah again is willing to stand</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.070" end="01:49:34.280" style="s2">in the place of Benjamin and become a</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.440" end="01:49:37.180" style="s2">slave himself and so now Joseph has</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.280" end="01:49:39.350" style="s2">determined that his brothers have</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.180" end="01:49:42.370" style="s2">developed their character to the point</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.350" end="01:49:45.520" style="s2">where reconciliation might be possible</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.370" end="01:49:46.820" style="s2">you know it says you should forgive and</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.520" end="01:49:49.900" style="s2">forget</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.820" end="01:49:53.810" style="s2">but the conditions for that are quite</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.900" end="01:49:55.610" style="s2">are quite specific you know if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.810" end="01:49:57.170" style="s2">you have a dispute with someone and</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.610" end="01:50:00.380" style="s2">they&#39;ve wronged you in some sense and</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.170" end="01:50:03.080" style="s2">they apologize the question is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.380" end="01:50:06.050" style="s2">the apology well it&#39;s a it&#39;s layout of a</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.080" end="01:50:07.820" style="s2">rationale it&#39;s something like as far as</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.050" end="01:50:10.430" style="s2">I can tell here&#39;s the reasons I did this</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.820" end="01:50:11.270" style="s2">horrible thing and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.430" end="01:50:13.430" style="s2">learned from it</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.270" end="01:50:15.560" style="s2">and here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do to try not</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.430" end="01:50:18.140" style="s2">to do it again and would you give me</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.560" end="01:50:20.210" style="s2">another crack at it that&#39;s the proper</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.140" end="01:50:22.730" style="s2">repentance right and then you forgive</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.210" end="01:50:24.320" style="s2">because you&#39;re an idiot too and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.730" end="01:50:25.910" style="s2">probably do something stupid and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.320" end="01:50:28.400" style="s2">you&#39;d like the same kind of break at</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.910" end="01:50:30.740" style="s2">some point and and besides if we all</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.400" end="01:50:32.750" style="s2">held each other completely to account at</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.740" end="01:50:34.820" style="s2">all possible times for everything then</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.750" end="01:50:35.890" style="s2">it&#39;d just be hopeless because there</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.820" end="01:50:40.070" style="s2">would be no room for error</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.890" end="01:50:42.260" style="s2">so the forgiveness which Joseph is</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.070" end="01:50:44.750" style="s2">showing is wise forgiveness he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.260" end="01:50:46.070" style="s2">gonna put himself out on the line for</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.750" end="01:50:47.780" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t learned so that the</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.070" end="01:50:49.280" style="s2">same stupid thing can happen again so</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.780" end="01:50:50.150" style="s2">that they can continue to spread misery</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.280" end="01:50:51.770" style="s2">wherever they go</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.150" end="01:50:54.290" style="s2">oh he&#39;s gonna find out if they&#39;ve clued</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.770" end="01:50:56.179" style="s2">in a little bit and then if so then they</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.290" end="01:50:59.120" style="s2">can move on with putting a family</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.179" end="01:51:01.550" style="s2">together and so that breaks him up he</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.120" end="01:51:03.380" style="s2">says Joseph could not refrain himself</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.550" end="01:51:07.610" style="s2">before all of them that stood by him and</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.380" end="01:51:12.110" style="s2">he cried and then he said get every man</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.610" end="01:51:14.060" style="s2">away from me so all the people except</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.110" end="01:51:15.679" style="s2">for Joseph&#39;s brother left and there</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.060" end="01:51:19.010" style="s2">stood no man with him well Joseph made</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.679" end="01:51:21.590" style="s2">himself known unto his brothers and</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.010" end="01:51:24.440" style="s2">Joseph said I&#39;m Joseph is my father</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.590" end="01:51:25.790" style="s2">still alive and his brothers could not</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.440" end="01:51:33.560" style="s2">answer for they were troubled at his</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.790" end="01:51:35.480" style="s2">presence it&#39;s like yeah understatement</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.560" end="01:51:37.790" style="s2">of the decade there mmm</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.480" end="01:51:39.500" style="s2">when Joseph said unto his brothers come</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.790" end="01:51:41.030" style="s2">nearer to me I pray you and they came</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.500" end="01:51:43.699" style="s2">nearer and he said I am Joseph your</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.030" end="01:51:45.469" style="s2">brother who you sold into Egypt but</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.699" end="01:51:47.810" style="s2">don&#39;t be grieved or angry with yourself</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.469" end="01:51:51.830" style="s2">that you sold me hither for God did send</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.810" end="01:51:53.449" style="s2">me before you to preserve life so now it</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.830" end="01:51:55.790" style="s2">was not you that sent me here but God</p>

<p begin="01:54:23.780" end="01:54:28.580" style="s2">because of course Joseph isn&#39;t even he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:54:38.360" end="01:54:43.730" style="s2">really something to think about and they</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.840" end="01:54:44.840" style="s2">took their cattle because that story</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.730" end="01:54:46.490" style="s2">there is that there isn&#39;t anything</p>

<p begin="01:58:22.290" end="01:58:26.250" style="s2">his father laid his right hand on the</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.000" end="01:58:27.960" style="s2">head of Ephraim it displeased him and he</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.250" end="01:58:30.440" style="s2">held up his father&#39;s hand to remove it</p>

<p begin="01:58:30.440" end="01:58:35.550" style="s2">and joseph said unto his father not not</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.660" end="01:58:37.980" style="s2">so my father for this is the firstborn</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.550" end="01:58:39.900" style="s2">put the right hand upon his head head</p>

<p begin="01:58:52.680" end="01:58:57.420" style="s2">continually it says when when God wants</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.200" end="01:58:59.220" style="s2">to intervene in human affairs what he</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.420" end="01:59:02.010" style="s2">does is invert tradition it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.220" end="01:59:04.050" style="s2">like that and so that&#39;s a sign that that</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.010" end="01:59:05.580" style="s2">there&#39;s something new and special going</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.050" end="01:59:07.110" style="s2">on and that gives precedence to the</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.580" end="01:59:09.300" style="s2">younger child rather than the older</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.110" end="01:59:11.070" style="s2">child precedents to what is new rather</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.300" end="01:59:12.590" style="s2">than what&#39;s traditional of course</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.070" end="01:59:15.420" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s necessary because</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.590" end="01:59:17.190" style="s2">tradition is insufficient and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.420" end="01:59:19.620" style="s2">something new has to come into being in</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.190" end="01:59:21.390" style="s2">order to update it and Jacob called</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.620" end="01:59:23.460" style="s2">together his sons and said gather</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.390" end="01:59:25.820" style="s2">together so that I can tell you that</p>

<p begin="01:59:43.920" end="01:59:48.300" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.940" end="01:59:50.790" style="s2">interesting here because Jacob blesses</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.300" end="01:59:55.050" style="s2">Joseph&#39;s sons before he blesses his own</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.790" end="01:59:57.960" style="s2">sons and so what he&#39;s doing is placing</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.050" end="02:00:00.540" style="s2">the rights of the firstborn into the</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.960" end="02:00:02.250" style="s2">sons of his favorite son and then he</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.540" end="02:00:05.520" style="s2">goes to his sons and so that has</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.250" end="02:00:06.949" style="s2">implications for the way the biblical</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.520" end="02:00:11.880" style="s2">stories lay themselves out from</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.949" end="02:00:13.620" style="s2">thenceforward the excellency of dignity</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.880" end="02:00:15.870" style="s2">and the excellency of power unstable as</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.620" end="02:00:17.820" style="s2">water thou shalt not excel because thou</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.870" end="02:00:20.190" style="s2">wentest up to thy father&#39;s bed then</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.820" end="02:00:22.020" style="s2">defiled it he went up to my couch you</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.190" end="02:00:27.060" style="s2">may remember that Reuben slept with his</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.020" end="02:00:29.310" style="s2">father&#39;s cucum concubine Simeon and Levi</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.060" end="02:00:33.350" style="s2">are brethren instruments of cruelty are</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.310" end="02:00:35.940" style="s2">in their habitations stop painting there</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.350" end="02:00:41.910" style="s2">what happened with Simeon and Levi was</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.940" end="02:00:44.699" style="s2">that somebody lay with their sister</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.910" end="02:00:48.000" style="s2">Dinah and then offered to marry her and</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.699" end="02:00:49.260" style="s2">then head and then became circumcised</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.000" end="02:00:50.969" style="s2">because that was part of the deal and</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.260" end="02:00:52.860" style="s2">then held her older men circumcised and</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.969" end="02:00:55.050" style="s2">then Simeon and Levi went in when they</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.860" end="02:00:58.440" style="s2">were recovering and killed them all and</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.050" end="02:01:00.810" style="s2">then Jacob and all his people had to</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.440" end="02:01:07.199" style="s2">leave because all that irritated their</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.810" end="02:01:09.030" style="s2">relatives so see me Simeon and Levi are</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.199" end="02:01:11.730" style="s2">brethren instruments of Cruelty are in</p>

<p begin="02:04:16.210" end="02:04:22.090" style="s2">deal with the chaos and mardik says yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.810" end="02:04:25.300" style="s2">ok no problem but here&#39;s the deal you</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.090" end="02:04:27.910" style="s2">elect me talk God and now I determine</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.300" end="02:04:30.250" style="s2">the destiny of the world and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.910" end="02:04:31.870" style="s2">desperate because like timeout is coming</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.250" end="02:04:33.610" style="s2">to get them that&#39;s chaos with the worst</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.870" end="02:04:34.900" style="s2">of all possible monsters they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:07:37.350" end="02:07:43.120" style="s2">Joseph will now hate us and will</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.390" end="02:07:45.820" style="s2">certainly pay back to us all the evil</p>

<p begin="02:07:45.820" end="02:07:51.100" style="s2">messenger saying my father did command</p>

<p begin="02:07:55.150" end="02:07:59.800" style="s2">pretty snively really for they did unto</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.940" end="02:08:01.660" style="s2">the evil and now we pray they forgive</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.800" end="02:08:04.510" style="s2">the trespass of the servants of the God</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.660" end="02:08:06.820" style="s2">of thy father and Joseph wept when they</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.510" end="02:08:08.620" style="s2">spake unto him and his brethren also</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.820" end="02:08:11.500" style="s2">went and fell down before his face and</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.620" end="02:08:15.730" style="s2">they said Behold we be thy servants and</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.500" end="02:08:18.040" style="s2">Joseph said unto them fear not for am I</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.730" end="02:08:20.440" style="s2">in the place of God but as for you you</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.040" end="02:08:23.140" style="s2">thought evil against me but God meant it</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.440" end="02:08:29.110" style="s2">unto good to bring to pass as it is this</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.140" end="02:08:30.700" style="s2">day to save much people alive now</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.110" end="02:08:32.380" style="s2">therefore fear ye not I will nourish you</p>

<p begin="02:08:39.929" end="02:08:50.530" style="s2">so the the idea there is that there is</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.980" end="02:08:55.780" style="s2">no evil so evil that good cannot triumph</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.530" end="02:08:57.940" style="s2">over it and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.780" end="02:09:00.130" style="s2">his father&#39;s house and Joseph lived 110</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.940" end="02:09:01.840" style="s2">years and Joseph saw ephram&#39;s children</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.130" end="02:09:04.330" style="s2">of the third generation the children</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.840" end="02:09:07.480" style="s2">also of marker the son of menace&#39; were</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.330" end="02:09:10.150" style="s2">brought up upon Joseph&#39;s knees and</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.480" end="02:09:12.580" style="s2">Joseph said unto his brethren I die and</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.150" end="02:09:14.320" style="s2">God will surely visit you and bring you</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.580" end="02:09:16.830" style="s2">out of this land unto the land where he</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.320" end="02:09:19.090" style="s2">swear to Abraham to Isaac and Jacob and</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.830" end="02:09:20.770" style="s2">Joseph took an oath of the children of</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.090" end="02:09:22.869" style="s2">Israel saying God will surely visit you</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.770" end="02:09:23.530" style="s2">and show and you shall carry my bones</p>

<p begin="02:09:23.530" end="02:09:29.380" style="s2">so Joseph died being a hundred and ten</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.929" end="02:09:32.739" style="s2">years old and they embalmed him and he</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.380" end="02:09:39.449" style="s2">was put into a coffin in Egypt and</p>

<p begin="02:12:01.550" end="02:12:06.119" style="s2">Hebrew because if you look at the Torah</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.949" end="02:12:08.159" style="s2">scrolls that you find in a synagogue</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.119" end="02:12:11.729" style="s2">there are no vowels there are no</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.159" end="02:12:13.650" style="s2">sentences there it is it is chaos chaos</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.729" end="02:12:15.209" style="s2">and order is trying to be bought into it</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.650" end="02:12:16.769" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering how knowledge of you</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.209" end="02:12:20.039" style="s2">knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.769" end="02:12:23.880" style="s2">which has many layers of I&#39;m staggering</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.039" end="02:12:26.219" style="s2">the ignorant of it so you know I read a</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.880" end="02:12:29.189" style="s2">lot of commentaries right I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.219" end="02:12:31.110" style="s2">zero in on the like with each of the</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.189" end="02:12:32.579" style="s2">phrases that we went through today I</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.110" end="02:12:35.999" style="s2">probably looked at ten different</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.579" end="02:12:38.760" style="s2">commentaries and so and then I have this</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.999" end="02:12:42.360" style="s2">underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.760" end="02:12:44.249" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like if you have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.360" end="02:12:46.619" style="s2">different templates to look at things</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.249" end="02:12:48.510" style="s2">through and then something shines</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.619" end="02:12:50.939" style="s2">through all those templates at the same</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.510" end="02:12:55.559" style="s2">time that&#39;s very unlikely and so then</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.939" end="02:12:57.479" style="s2">you can you know a coincidence is one</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.559" end="02:12:59.070" style="s2">thing but five coincidences that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.479" end="02:13:01.559" style="s2">longer a coincidence that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.070" end="02:13:03.449" style="s2">else and so I think I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.559" end="02:13:05.909" style="s2">despite the fact that there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.449" end="02:13:07.769" style="s2">things that I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.909" end="02:13:09.239" style="s2">enough things that I do know to kind of</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.769" end="02:13:13.289" style="s2">weave my way through this with some</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.239" end="02:13:14.939" style="s2">degree of utility if not certainty yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.289" end="02:13:16.320" style="s2">cuz I just which is the second part</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.939" end="02:13:18.479" style="s2">which I guess maybe you don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.320" end="02:13:19.620" style="s2">the the majestic the Jewish oral stories</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.479" end="02:13:21.480" style="s2">that date back almost</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.620" end="02:13:25.080" style="s2">as long as these stories which fill in a</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.480" end="02:13:26.370" style="s2">lot of mind-blowing ly crazy random so</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.080" end="02:13:27.180" style="s2">many details about these stories and I</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.370" end="02:13:28.710" style="s2">was just wondering if you had</p>
<p begin="02:13:27.180" end="02:13:30.540" style="s2">encountered any of them before I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.710" end="02:13:33.360" style="s2">encountered some of them but again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.540" end="02:13:36.810" style="s2">it&#39;s well as you know it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.360" end="02:13:38.250" style="s2">rich tradition and so I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.810" end="02:13:40.170" style="s2">encountered enough of it</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.250" end="02:13:42.210" style="s2">were you thinking of anything in</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.170" end="02:13:44.430" style="s2">specific specifically in relationship to</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.210" end="02:13:46.350" style="s2">this story not in particular I actually</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.430" end="02:13:49.290" style="s2">forgot it I was I was intending to bring</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.350" end="02:13:55.970" style="s2">you a book of majestic story that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.290" end="02:13:58.680" style="s2">hell of a thing to say now to say that</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.970" end="02:13:59.790" style="s2">but yeah maybe for the exodus version</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.680" end="02:14:03.350" style="s2">I&#39;ll bring you this all right all right</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.790" end="02:14:03.350" style="s2">that would be good yeah okay</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.410" end="02:14:09.840" style="s2">hi dr. Peterson I would just like to ask</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.320" end="02:14:11.970" style="s2">you to please talk about what you called</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.840" end="02:14:15.000" style="s2">a psychic death also known as an ego</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.970" end="02:14:17.160" style="s2">death okay sorry say that again would</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.000" end="02:14:19.980" style="s2">you please talk about what you refer to</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.160" end="02:14:23.820" style="s2">as a psychic death also called an ego</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.980" end="02:14:27.240" style="s2">death that&#39;s what happens when someone</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.820" end="02:14:30.450" style="s2">who loves you betrays you right so</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.240" end="02:14:32.820" style="s2">imagine that like the world is</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.450" end="02:14:34.560" style="s2">complicated beyond comprehension</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.820" end="02:14:36.870" style="s2">right and you only see a very little bit</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.560" end="02:14:38.490" style="s2">of it and the way you structure your</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.870" end="02:14:40.530" style="s2">understanding is you make assumptions</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.490" end="02:14:43.190" style="s2">about things and they&#39;re simplifying</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.530" end="02:14:46.620" style="s2">assumptions so if you trust someone you</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.190" end="02:14:48.920" style="s2">reduce their complexity massively right</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.620" end="02:14:51.420" style="s2">because like let&#39;s say we were married</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.920" end="02:14:52.980" style="s2">then there&#39;s a whole bunch of ways that</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.420" end="02:14:56.250" style="s2">you&#39;re going to act that are going to be</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.980" end="02:14:58.260" style="s2">simpler okay so then I can tolerate</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.250" end="02:15:02.210" style="s2">being around you in some sense because</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.260" end="02:15:02.210" style="s2">you&#39;re not everything at once</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.390" end="02:15:09.750" style="s2">now those simplifying structures are</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.830" end="02:15:11.450" style="s2">hierarchically assembled and some of</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.750" end="02:15:13.860" style="s2">them are far more important than others</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.450" end="02:15:15.480" style="s2">Trust is one of them especially trust in</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.860" end="02:15:17.160" style="s2">loved ones family members which is why</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.480" end="02:15:19.770" style="s2">betrayal by a family member is really</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.160" end="02:15:21.990" style="s2">catastrophic because it you know it</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.770" end="02:15:23.460" style="s2">destabilizes your past right all the</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.990" end="02:15:25.440" style="s2">memories you have it destabilizes your</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.460" end="02:15:27.360" style="s2">present it destabilizes your future it</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.440" end="02:15:29.910" style="s2">shakes your faith in human beings</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.360" end="02:15:32.599" style="s2">including yourself and everything</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.910" end="02:15:36.469" style="s2">collapses and that&#39;s an ego death</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.599" end="02:15:38.300" style="s2">and so now underneath the ego as far as</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.469" end="02:15:40.820" style="s2">Jung was concerned was another structure</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.300" end="02:15:42.739" style="s2">that he called the self and the self is</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.820" end="02:15:48.649" style="s2">the thing that remains constant across</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.739" end="02:15:49.489" style="s2">ego deaths but it&#39;s it&#39;s deeper and less</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.649" end="02:15:52.909" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.489" end="02:15:54.590" style="s2">it&#39;s archetypal and it&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.909" end="02:15:56.689" style="s2">the Eagle collapses into when it</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.590" end="02:15:59.749" style="s2">collapses and then that rebuilds the ego</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.689" end="02:16:02.359" style="s2">something like that across time but</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.749" end="02:16:04.070" style="s2">that&#39;s when an ego death is now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.359" end="02:16:07.429" style="s2">variants of that because you can have a</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.070" end="02:16:09.320" style="s2">voluntary or involuntary ego death and a</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.429" end="02:16:11.899" style="s2">voluntary ego death is when you learn a</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.320" end="02:16:14.030" style="s2">bunch and you&#39;re willing to let go so</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.899" end="02:16:15.590" style="s2">that would be your own emulation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.030" end="02:16:17.169" style="s2">like you&#39;re lighting you&#39;re a Phoenix</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.590" end="02:16:19.820" style="s2">and your lighting yourself on fire</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.169" end="02:16:22.309" style="s2">that&#39;s a much better idea even though it</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.820" end="02:16:24.349" style="s2">can still be really harsh the</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.309" end="02:16:25.820" style="s2">involuntary ego deaths they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.349" end="02:16:27.949" style="s2">hard on people people will do almost</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.820" end="02:16:30.229" style="s2">anything to stop that from happening</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.949" end="02:16:35.179" style="s2">which is partly why they fight to</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.229" end="02:16:37.179" style="s2">maintain their group fostered axiomatic</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.179" end="02:16:40.819" style="s2">simplifications it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.179" end="02:16:42.349" style="s2">because it&#39;s very you&#39;d lose your like</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.819" end="02:16:44.420" style="s2">that ego death is a journey into the</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.349" end="02:16:46.159" style="s2">underworld or it&#39;s a collapse into chaos</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.420" end="02:16:48.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s not so bad if you do it</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.159" end="02:16:50.239" style="s2">purposefully but in the Pinocchio story</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.800" end="02:16:52.010" style="s2">for example that&#39;s exemplified by</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.239" end="02:16:53.840" style="s2">Pinocchio going down to the depths to</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.010" end="02:16:55.550" style="s2">rescue his father from the whale now he</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.840" end="02:16:57.590" style="s2">does that voluntarily but a damn near</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.550" end="02:17:00.469" style="s2">kills it right I mean first of all he</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.590" end="02:17:02.929" style="s2">hardly gets out of the whale second he</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.469" end="02:17:04.849" style="s2">actually drowns and dies but he comes</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.929" end="02:17:09.019" style="s2">back to life so even if you do it</p>
<p begin="02:17:04.849" end="02:17:10.580" style="s2">voluntarily it&#39;s still life it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.019" end="02:17:12.469" style="s2">better than doing it involuntarily</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.580" end="02:17:22.929" style="s2">which is the other alternative so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.469" end="02:17:26.420" style="s2">what it is you bet hello Doctor Buddhism</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.929" end="02:17:27.979" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been listening to back to all of</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.420" end="02:17:30.349" style="s2">these biblical lectures for the second</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.979" end="02:17:32.210" style="s2">time now and I wanted to show you an</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.349" end="02:17:33.469" style="s2">observation I came upon because I was</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.210" end="02:17:35.029" style="s2">trying to find a question that you</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.469" end="02:17:37.519" style="s2">haven&#39;t been asked before which is</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.029" end="02:17:39.330" style="s2">harder than doing my ryerson exams</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.519" end="02:17:42.450" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.330" end="02:17:46.500" style="s2">so so I&#39;ve noticed I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.450" end="02:17:48.330" style="s2">getting funnier oh yes oh no I think</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.500" end="02:17:50.069" style="s2">Michael Coren said that this week I</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.330" end="02:17:53.790" style="s2">think but the word he used was bizarre I</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.069" end="02:17:55.620" style="s2">think actually I&#39;m feeling better so</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.790" end="02:17:58.229" style="s2">that&#39;s I actually have a sense of humor</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.620" end="02:17:59.819" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to believe that but so it</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.229" end="02:18:01.969" style="s2">sort of comes back when I&#39;m not feeling</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.819" end="02:18:05.219" style="s2">like I&#39;m going to die at any moment so</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.969" end="02:18:06.960" style="s2">yeah I basically noticed one you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.219" end="02:18:16.439" style="s2">making more attempts at jokes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.960" end="02:18:18.500" style="s2">great thank you thank you too those</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.439" end="02:18:20.790" style="s2">jokes are landing more often all right</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.500" end="02:18:23.969" style="s2">but then there&#39;s this third element</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.790" end="02:18:25.950" style="s2">which I think was what Steve Martin quit</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.969" end="02:18:27.960" style="s2">because of which is that I think the</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.950" end="02:18:29.880" style="s2">audience is anticipating jokes more and</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.960" end="02:18:31.410" style="s2">they&#39;re actually you know I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.880" end="02:18:33.359" style="s2">people laughing more at things that</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.410" end="02:18:35.149" style="s2">aren&#39;t intending to be jokes so I was</p>
<p begin="02:18:33.359" end="02:18:37.740" style="s2">just wondering what you make of that and</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.149" end="02:18:39.540" style="s2">they&#39;re intended I&#39;m hoping they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.740" end="02:18:41.219" style="s2">intended just because I keep a straight</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.540" end="02:18:44.490" style="s2">face doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not intended</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.219" end="02:18:46.859" style="s2">to be jokes so yeah no it&#39;s good look</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.490" end="02:18:49.290" style="s2">one of the things is like it&#39;s and I try</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.859" end="02:18:51.120" style="s2">to keep this and the wild goal probably</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.290" end="02:18:52.139" style="s2">about five years ago that even when</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.120" end="02:18:54.719" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with really serious</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.139" end="02:18:56.550" style="s2">matters that if you&#39;re not handling it</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.719" end="02:18:58.319" style="s2">with a light touch you&#39;re not an expert</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.550" end="02:18:59.700" style="s2">at it you know what a master out it and</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.319" end="02:19:01.679" style="s2">you think well there are some things</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.700" end="02:19:04.559" style="s2">that are so deep and dark that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.679" end="02:19:07.319" style="s2">handle it with a light touch and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.559" end="02:19:09.120" style="s2">actually not true you can that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.319" end="02:19:10.530" style="s2">mean you make light of them it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.120" end="02:19:14.399" style="s2">mean anything like that it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.530" end="02:19:15.990" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s minimal necessary force it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.399" end="02:19:18.240" style="s2">something like that you don&#39;t hit it any</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.990" end="02:19:20.340" style="s2">harder than you have to and it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.240" end="02:19:23.519" style="s2">an art when you&#39;re discussing serious</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.340" end="02:19:26.010" style="s2">matters and so well one of the up shots</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.519" end="02:19:27.899" style="s2">of that is that because we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.010" end="02:19:29.340" style="s2">serious Madison because serious matters</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.899" end="02:19:30.689" style="s2">are being discussed in the ultra large</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.340" end="02:19:32.099" style="s2">right now it would be really good if</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.689" end="02:19:34.620" style="s2">everybody could keep their sense of</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.099" end="02:19:36.450" style="s2">humor you know and I see positive signs</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.620" end="02:19:38.910" style="s2">of that like there&#39;s a lot of satirical</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.450" end="02:19:41.160" style="s2">activity on the net you know and that</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.910" end="02:19:44.519" style="s2">could easily catalyze into horror mob</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.160" end="02:19:45.960" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t it is it is you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.519" end="02:19:48.569" style="s2">happening to some degree but a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.960" end="02:19:50.310" style="s2">its satire in comedy and as long as we</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.569" end="02:19:53.010" style="s2">can keep a sense of humor about this</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.310" end="02:19:55.140" style="s2">then I think well</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.010" end="02:19:57.630" style="s2">we&#39;re not as close to disaster as we</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.140" end="02:19:59.399" style="s2">might be and so what one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.630" end="02:20:01.439" style="s2">that I have found rather ominous is that</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.399" end="02:20:04.069" style="s2">there are comedians first of all being</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.439" end="02:20:06.449" style="s2">persecuted for under free speech</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.069" end="02:20:08.430" style="s2">restriction legislation which i think is</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.449" end="02:20:10.499" style="s2">absolutely appalling but also that there</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.430" end="02:20:14.479" style="s2">are comedians now who won&#39;t perform on</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.499" end="02:20:14.479" style="s2">university campuses John Cleese won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.989" end="02:20:18.479" style="s2">Seinfeld that&#39;s like well you know how</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.800" end="02:20:21.270" style="s2">offensive he is it&#39;s no wonder that I</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.479" end="02:20:23.159" style="s2">mean he&#39;s like the straightest nicest</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.270" end="02:20:25.199" style="s2">comedian you could possibly imagine he</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.159" end="02:20:26.999" style="s2">won&#39;t perform on college campuses I</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.199" end="02:20:32.249" style="s2">think louis c.k won&#39;t perform on or</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.999" end="02:20:35.039" style="s2">anywhere else but it&#39;s a bad sign but no</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.249" end="02:20:37.170" style="s2">humor humor is good and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.039" end="02:20:40.020" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been kind of watching how</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.170" end="02:20:42.210" style="s2">I&#39;m represented on the web weirdly</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.020" end="02:20:44.220" style="s2">enough and there&#39;s all these memes that</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.210" end="02:20:47.520" style="s2">have emerged I don&#39;t know thousands of</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.220" end="02:20:50.369" style="s2">the bloody things and most of them are</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.520" end="02:20:54.149" style="s2">comical and that&#39;s good like people are</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.369" end="02:20:55.409" style="s2">are there hat there whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.149" end="02:20:57.060" style="s2">they&#39;re doing I don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.409" end="02:20:59.039" style="s2">it is but it&#39;s being done with a</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.060" end="02:20:59.999" style="s2">relatively light touch and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.039" end="02:21:01.890" style="s2">really good</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.999" end="02:21:03.810" style="s2">that&#39;s how it should be you got to have</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.890" end="02:21:06.149" style="s2">a sense of humor I mean it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.810" end="02:21:09.600" style="s2">things that makes life bearable so or</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.149" end="02:21:11.810" style="s2">maybe even better than bearable so you</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.600" end="02:21:11.810" style="s2">bet</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.840" end="02:21:23.770" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson just want to say what</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.800" end="02:21:26.470" style="s2">a great lecture series and this is</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.770" end="02:21:30.240" style="s2">lesson this year so merry Christmas to</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.470" end="02:21:30.240" style="s2">you and your family thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.020" end="02:21:37.899" style="s2">don&#39;t get too enthusiastic about that I</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.520" end="02:21:40.930" style="s2">wrote you an essay of a question and</p>
<p begin="02:21:37.899" end="02:21:42.670" style="s2">then I used the lecture of the essay</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.930" end="02:21:45.850" style="s2">writing guide on it&#39;s like 2:30 to</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.670" end="02:21:48.460" style="s2">narrow it down to just a few pages a few</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.850" end="02:21:50.770" style="s2">lines and then during this at this</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.460" end="02:21:52.780" style="s2">particular lecture like the zig zag</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.770" end="02:21:56.380" style="s2">slide manifest again and I thought I</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.780" end="02:22:00.460" style="s2">basically just had all my questions</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.380" end="02:22:07.420" style="s2">answered so basically I just I want to</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.460" end="02:22:10.600" style="s2">ask the idea of your you&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.420" end="02:22:13.330" style="s2">lecture that was on YouTube many years</p>
<p begin="02:22:10.600" end="02:22:16.479" style="s2">ago and you keep referring to Cain and</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.330" end="02:22:19.000" style="s2">Abel and the the death of Abel by Cain</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.479" end="02:22:21.580" style="s2">and the curse in it and I think well</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.000" end="02:22:25.300" style="s2">that that was the that was a single</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.580" end="02:22:28.060" style="s2">brother two brothers conflict but but</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.300" end="02:22:31.780" style="s2">here we have in the sense of Jacob the</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.060" end="02:22:34.060" style="s2">twelve there was one who was one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.780" end="02:22:36.370" style="s2">good one who was an able archetype and</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.060" end="02:22:40.060" style="s2">there were twelve eleven that came after</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.370" end="02:22:44.170" style="s2">him so that I don&#39;t know maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.060" end="02:22:45.729" style="s2">something about the division or no</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.170" end="02:22:46.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a good observation I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.729" end="02:22:49.180" style="s2">thought about that</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.600" end="02:22:51.310" style="s2">yeah well I mean there&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="02:22:49.180" end="02:22:52.930" style="s2">variability because Reuben and Reuben</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.310" end="02:22:54.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t quite as bad as the rest but yeah</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.930" end="02:22:57.880" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s probably easier for the</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.910" end="02:23:00.880" style="s2">Cain side to multiply luckily it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.880" end="02:23:06.220" style="s2">as powerful because it doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.880" end="02:23:08.680" style="s2">anything like it yes yes and you know</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.220" end="02:23:13.120" style="s2">you know there&#39;s young was often</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.680" end="02:23:14.530" style="s2">included accused of manichaean isn&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.120" end="02:23:16.359" style="s2">not pronouncing that properly but there</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.530" end="02:23:18.460" style="s2">was a there was a variant of Christian</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.359" end="02:23:20.710" style="s2">dogma that held that good and evil were</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.460" end="02:23:23.290" style="s2">separate metaphysical realities and that</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.710" end="02:23:25.660" style="s2">they were battling for the for</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.290" end="02:23:27.500" style="s2">governance of the cosmos something like</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.660" end="02:23:30.470" style="s2">that but they both had an independent</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.500" end="02:23:32.810" style="s2">and the classical Christian idea which</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.470" end="02:23:34.790" style="s2">one out over that was that no that good</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.810" end="02:23:36.830" style="s2">was real but evil was the absence of</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.790" end="02:23:38.690" style="s2">good now that produced all sorts of the</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.830" end="02:23:40.910" style="s2">absence of good produces all sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.690" end="02:23:43.130" style="s2">consequences and it is interesting to</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.910" end="02:23:45.680" style="s2">read young because he does get kind of</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.130" end="02:23:46.700" style="s2">Manichean in his discussions and I think</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.680" end="02:23:48.680" style="s2">it was partly because he was so</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.700" end="02:23:50.750" style="s2">concerned about what happened in Nazi</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.680" end="02:23:52.340" style="s2">Germany and then with cold war</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.750" end="02:23:56.210" style="s2">afterwards you know because evil seemed</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.340" end="02:23:59.630" style="s2">to be a palpable force but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.210" end="02:24:01.250" style="s2">that it&#39;s as powerful as good but I do</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.630" end="02:24:04.850" style="s2">think it&#39;s easier for it to multiply</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.250" end="02:24:07.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s what&#39;s easier path it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.850" end="02:24:09.950" style="s2">easy to be resentful and hostile and</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.040" end="02:24:12.170" style="s2">bitter and and do nothing that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.950" end="02:24:13.430" style="s2">it&#39;s horrible and it&#39;s hard on people</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.170" end="02:24:16.100" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t require a tremendous</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.430" end="02:24:18.170" style="s2">amount of faith or effort so maybe that</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.100" end="02:24:20.900" style="s2">is why it&#39;s multiplied in the final</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.170" end="02:24:23.450" style="s2">story in Genesis yeah and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.900" end="02:24:26.750" style="s2">reading ahead and for my own based on</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.450" end="02:24:29.600" style="s2">the interest of the president presented</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.750" end="02:24:31.790" style="s2">stories and I I keyed in on a few other</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.600" end="02:24:33.860" style="s2">books and chapters in the Bible like</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.790" end="02:24:37.190" style="s2">first Corinthians 13 which is the love</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.860" end="02:24:39.520" style="s2">chapter and that cycles through the idea</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.190" end="02:24:44.410" style="s2">of I can have all things in life</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.520" end="02:24:44.410" style="s2">knowledge power but it&#39;s all passing and</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.890" end="02:24:50.420" style="s2">now and forever our hope faith hope and</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.510" end="02:24:52.970" style="s2">love and and of course love triumphs</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.420" end="02:24:54.590" style="s2">over all yeah well the love issue see</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.970" end="02:24:56.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve been saying I thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.590" end="02:24:58.520" style="s2">the relationship between love and truth</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.300" end="02:25:00.710" style="s2">because I&#39;ve thought and talked a lot</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.520" end="02:25:02.120" style="s2">more about truth and I think partly</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.710" end="02:25:04.930" style="s2">that&#39;s because love is a word that you</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.120" end="02:25:07.400" style="s2">can hardly even say because it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.930" end="02:25:09.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s being dragged behind a</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.400" end="02:25:11.630" style="s2">car through mud puddles it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.140" end="02:25:13.730" style="s2">like that but so sorry let me just</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.630" end="02:25:16.610" style="s2">finish it lab rating this idea but I</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.730" end="02:25:19.490" style="s2">think that the the love idea is</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.610" end="02:25:20.870" style="s2">associated with for me at least with</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.490" end="02:25:23.330" style="s2">what I discussed at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.870" end="02:25:25.220" style="s2">this lecture with regards to faith I</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.330" end="02:25:28.040" style="s2">think you have to make a decision about</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.220" end="02:25:31.070" style="s2">what your attitude towards being is</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.040" end="02:25:33.680" style="s2">going to be and the proper attitude in</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.070" end="02:25:36.230" style="s2">my estimation is that you&#39;re working for</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.680" end="02:25:38.510" style="s2">its betterment you know and so maybe</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.230" end="02:25:39.660" style="s2">maybe you have the same attitude towards</p>
<p begin="02:25:38.510" end="02:25:42.000" style="s2">being as you do</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.660" end="02:25:44.040" style="s2">towards someone that you love like a son</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.000" end="02:25:47.070" style="s2">or a daughter or wife that you want</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.040" end="02:25:50.010" style="s2">things to be better and that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.070" end="02:25:54.420" style="s2">your aim so the aim is basically the aim</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.010" end="02:25:55.950" style="s2">is motivated by love you want things to</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.420" end="02:25:57.930" style="s2">be better because I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.950" end="02:25:59.910" style="s2">definition of love like if you really</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.930" end="02:26:02.010" style="s2">care for someone you can tell because</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.910" end="02:26:04.290" style="s2">you want things to be better for them</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.010" end="02:26:06.271" style="s2">and then I think truth is nested inside</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.290" end="02:26:08.340" style="s2">that because I think that truth is the</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.271" end="02:26:16.771" style="s2">best servant of love it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.340" end="02:26:18.510" style="s2">that so I&#39;ve been struggling with an</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.771" end="02:26:19.650" style="s2">idea recently that I was thinking maybe</p>
<p begin="02:26:18.510" end="02:26:22.590" style="s2">you&#39;d be able to help me out with</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.650" end="02:26:24.990" style="s2">basically in a recent interview you</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.590" end="02:26:27.410" style="s2">talked about how myth is meant to</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.990" end="02:26:31.891" style="s2">reconcile inherent contradictions in</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.410" end="02:26:34.610" style="s2">reality right but but I&#39;m sort of stuck</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.891" end="02:26:36.570" style="s2">between two mythological or</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.610" end="02:26:39.000" style="s2">psychoanalytic ideas that I think are</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.570" end="02:26:40.800" style="s2">both really important but they seem to</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.000" end="02:26:42.061" style="s2">have a inherent contradiction within</p>
<p begin="02:26:40.800" end="02:26:44.190" style="s2">them that I&#39;ve been trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.061" end="02:26:46.200" style="s2">so on one hand you have this idea that</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.190" end="02:26:47.851" style="s2">there&#39;s times in your life where you</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.200" end="02:26:50.160" style="s2">have to identify things in yourself that</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.851" end="02:26:53.370" style="s2">are insufficient or there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.160" end="02:26:55.771" style="s2">somehow that you have to kind of have a</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.370" end="02:26:58.170" style="s2">controlled burn or like a Phoenix like</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.771" end="02:27:00.630" style="s2">transformation where you discard part of</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.170" end="02:27:03.150" style="s2">yourself that doesn&#39;t fit or is not</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.630" end="02:27:05.521" style="s2">working but then on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.150" end="02:27:08.700" style="s2">have talked about this this Union idea</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.521" end="02:27:12.061" style="s2">where as you become really when you get</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.700" end="02:27:14.130" style="s2">older you mature by reincorporating</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.061" end="02:27:16.590" style="s2">things about yourself that you lost when</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.130" end="02:27:18.271" style="s2">you were younger or that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:16.590" end="02:27:19.440" style="s2">trying to integrate your shadow or</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.271" end="02:27:22.021" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to find parts of your</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.440" end="02:27:23.700" style="s2">personality that that maybe you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:27:22.021" end="02:27:25.440" style="s2">rejecting and trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.700" end="02:27:27.480" style="s2">to bring them into into the folder in</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.440" end="02:27:30.300" style="s2">the hole so he&#39;s got this quote that I</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.480" end="02:27:33.330" style="s2">really like which is I&#39;d rather behold</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.300" end="02:27:35.790" style="s2">and good right right so so on one hand</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.330" end="02:27:37.440" style="s2">you may identify something as a problem</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.790" end="02:27:40.021" style="s2">and you want to get rid of it or burn it</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.440" end="02:27:44.790" style="s2">off but then on the other hand it seems</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.021" end="02:27:46.891" style="s2">like the the path to being stronger is</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.790" end="02:27:49.950" style="s2">to figure out how to put everything</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.891" end="02:27:51.360" style="s2">together so there&#39;s that there&#39;s a one</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.950" end="02:27:53.399" style="s2">of the things Jung wrote about in his</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.360" end="02:27:56.100" style="s2">works on alchemy was</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.399" end="02:27:59.280" style="s2">an explanation of the prime alchemical</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.100" end="02:28:03.390" style="s2">dictum which was solve a coagula which</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.280" end="02:28:06.330" style="s2">meant dissolve and integrate right so so</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.390" end="02:28:10.530" style="s2">imagine this imagine that imagine you</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.330" end="02:28:13.070" style="s2">had a fairly hostile father who was not</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.530" end="02:28:15.630" style="s2">very well controlled in his aggression</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.070" end="02:28:18.180" style="s2">decent person other than that but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.630" end="02:28:20.760" style="s2">say that and so your reaction is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.180" end="02:28:22.939" style="s2">never going to be aggressive and so</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.760" end="02:28:26.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve built a like a moral structure</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.939" end="02:28:29.100" style="s2">that&#39;s part of your personality and</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.540" end="02:28:31.530" style="s2">there&#39;s possibility floating around</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.100" end="02:28:36.840" style="s2">outside of that did you you&#39;ve denied an</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.530" end="02:28:39.180" style="s2">ethical you&#39;ve denied any ethical what</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.840" end="02:28:41.010" style="s2">would you say you&#39;ve stripped the idea</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.180" end="02:28:43.710" style="s2">of aggression of any ethical utility</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.010" end="02:28:46.290" style="s2">whatsoever okay so what happens this</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.710" end="02:28:48.140" style="s2">burns off and then that comes back up</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.290" end="02:28:50.729" style="s2">now you still have to integrate it so</p>
<p begin="02:28:48.140" end="02:28:53.790" style="s2">it&#39;s associated in some sense with</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.729" end="02:28:56.370" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s ideas morality as cowardice</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.790" end="02:29:00.240" style="s2">because one of nature&#39;s most trenchant</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.370" end="02:29:03.120" style="s2">critiques of traditional morality let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.240" end="02:29:05.070" style="s2">say is that most of what passes for</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.120" end="02:29:07.350" style="s2">morality isn&#39;t morality it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.070" end="02:29:09.450" style="s2">cowardice it&#39;s not that I&#39;m a good</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.350" end="02:29:11.250" style="s2">person and I don&#39;t hurt you it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.450" end="02:29:12.840" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid to hurt you and because I</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.250" end="02:29:14.790" style="s2">don&#39;t want to admit that I&#39;m afraid to</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.840" end="02:29:17.640" style="s2">hurt you and then I say I&#39;m moral</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.790" end="02:29:19.189" style="s2">because then I can mask my essential</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.640" end="02:29:22.350" style="s2">fear and cowardice in a guise of</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.189" end="02:29:24.570" style="s2">morality and that happens far more often</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.350" end="02:29:26.550" style="s2">than you would think because harmless</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.570" end="02:29:29.880" style="s2">and moral are by no means the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.550" end="02:29:31.830" style="s2">so some of what you&#39;re burning off you</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.880" end="02:29:33.359" style="s2">can sit and this is where Freud was such</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.830" end="02:29:35.399" style="s2">a genius I think is because he</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.359" end="02:29:37.770" style="s2">concentrated on aggression and sexuality</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.399" end="02:29:39.990" style="s2">which are perhaps the two most difficult</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.770" end="02:29:48.730" style="s2">parts of a personality to integrate said</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.990" end="02:29:52.240" style="s2">that the the hyper simp</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.730" end="02:29:55.061" style="s2">fied morality stops you from tapping</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.240" end="02:29:57.221" style="s2">into deeper recesses of your psyche and</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.061" end="02:29:59.681" style="s2">it&#39;s partly because there are primal</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.221" end="02:30:01.150" style="s2">forces it&#39;s not surprising that you</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.681" end="02:30:03.341" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have anything to do with</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.150" end="02:30:04.450" style="s2">them that you stay away from situations</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.341" end="02:30:06.370" style="s2">where they might make themselves</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.450" end="02:30:08.080" style="s2">manifest but the problem is by denying</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.370" end="02:30:10.780" style="s2">the worst in yourself in that manner</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.080" end="02:30:13.421" style="s2">suppressing it you preclude the</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.780" end="02:30:14.860" style="s2">possibility of the best because no one</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.421" end="02:30:17.440" style="s2">can be a good person without integrating</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.860" end="02:30:19.391" style="s2">their capacity for aggression because</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.440" end="02:30:23.591" style="s2">without that capacity of a progression</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.391" end="02:30:25.570" style="s2">you cannot say no because no means if</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.591" end="02:30:28.240" style="s2">you really say it no means there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.570" end="02:30:31.150" style="s2">anything that you can do to me that will</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.240" end="02:30:33.280" style="s2">make me change my mind or or conversely</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.150" end="02:30:37.360" style="s2">it means I will play for higher stakes</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.280" end="02:30:39.490" style="s2">than you will and unless you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.360" end="02:30:41.561" style="s2">aggression integrated there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.490" end="02:30:43.780" style="s2">chance you can say that and if you did</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.561" end="02:30:47.290" style="s2">no one would take you seriously because</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.780" end="02:30:49.421" style="s2">they&#39;d know it was just a show so one of</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.290" end="02:30:51.311" style="s2">the most useful things that Jung did I</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.421" end="02:30:52.931" style="s2">think was to work on this idea of the</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.311" end="02:30:54.461" style="s2">integration of the shadow because he was</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.931" end="02:30:56.950" style="s2">really interested in the idea of evil</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.461" end="02:30:59.620" style="s2">right especially working with trying to</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.950" end="02:31:01.061" style="s2">parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.620" end="02:31:02.620" style="s2">and during the Second World War</p>
<p begin="02:31:01.061" end="02:31:04.391" style="s2">what do you do with the part of you</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.620" end="02:31:06.400" style="s2">that&#39;s aggressive and and potentially</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.391" end="02:31:08.290" style="s2">malevolent do you just crush it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.400" end="02:31:10.211" style="s2">the super-ego response in some sense do</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.290" end="02:31:13.570" style="s2">you just put it behind you so to speak</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.211" end="02:31:15.671" style="s2">is that a possibility or do you admit to</p>
<p begin="02:31:13.570" end="02:31:20.381" style="s2">its existence and bring it into the game</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.671" end="02:31:22.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s see for Freud in some sense</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.381" end="02:31:25.091" style="s2">morality was super-ego clamping down on</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.900" end="02:31:27.761" style="s2">the it&#39;d and they were fundamentally</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.091" end="02:31:29.080" style="s2">opposed both young and Piaget had a</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.761" end="02:31:31.721" style="s2">different idea and I think they were</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.080" end="02:31:35.410" style="s2">right it&#39;s like no no you invite the bad</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.721" end="02:31:38.500" style="s2">guys out to play and so you&#39;re an</p>

<p begin="02:31:38.500" end="02:31:43.240" style="s2">disciplined aggression that makes you</p>

<p begin="02:32:19.880" end="02:32:24.710" style="s2">of that integration so when you say</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.939" end="02:32:26.630" style="s2">dissolve and integrate it&#39;d be a good</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.710" end="02:32:28.850" style="s2">way to sort of bring the two ideas</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.630" end="02:32:31.790" style="s2">together that the burning off and the</p>
<p begin="02:32:28.850" end="02:32:34.430" style="s2">difficult process is necessary because</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.790" end="02:32:36.739" style="s2">the elements of yourself are structured</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.430" end="02:32:38.989" style="s2">together in a rigid way that is not</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.739" end="02:32:40.479" style="s2">working properly and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.989" end="02:32:43.760" style="s2">to Geppetto in the belly of the whale</p>
<p begin="02:32:40.479" end="02:32:45.949" style="s2">he&#39;s so caught in his presuppositions</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.760" end="02:32:47.810" style="s2">that he can&#39;t escape right and so</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.949" end="02:32:49.520" style="s2">Pinocchio represents the new force so</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.810" end="02:32:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting so when you watch</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.520" end="02:32:53.630" style="s2">Pinocchio try to rescue him the first</p>
<p begin="02:32:51.680" end="02:32:55.220" style="s2">thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.630" end="02:32:57.050" style="s2">with a fish because he wants something</p>
<p begin="02:32:55.220" end="02:32:58.399" style="s2">to eat but Pinocchio is better than</p>
<p begin="02:32:57.050" end="02:33:00.680" style="s2">something to eat because he could rescue</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.399" end="02:33:02.060" style="s2">him so he doesn&#39;t need to eat and then</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.680" end="02:33:04.399" style="s2">Pinocchio wants to make a fire in</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.060" end="02:33:06.680" style="s2">Geppetto objects because he&#39;s gonna burn</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.399" end="02:33:08.090" style="s2">up all the furniture it&#39;s like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.680" end="02:33:10.430" style="s2">need the damn furniture if we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.090" end="02:33:12.620" style="s2">out of the whale you know and so so</p>
<p begin="02:33:10.430" end="02:33:14.659" style="s2">Geppetto and and he&#39;s old so that that</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.620" end="02:33:16.489" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s the rigid structure</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.659" end="02:33:18.859" style="s2">that&#39;s the old year that has to die off</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.489" end="02:33:20.659" style="s2">before the new year can be born it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.859" end="02:33:22.760" style="s2">forest fire that allows for new growth</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.659" end="02:33:24.830" style="s2">and and that&#39;s how those things are put</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.760" end="02:33:26.540" style="s2">together and to see and it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.830" end="02:33:28.040" style="s2">know too because if you burn something</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.540" end="02:33:30.649" style="s2">off you might think well there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="02:33:28.040" end="02:33:32.300" style="s2">left it&#39;s like that&#39;s not true if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.649" end="02:33:34.489" style="s2">dead wood then you have room for new</p>
<p begin="02:33:32.300" end="02:33:37.760" style="s2">growth and you want to be doing that on</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.489" end="02:33:40.399" style="s2">a fairly regular basis that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:33:37.760" end="02:33:42.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the snake that sheds its skin and</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.399" end="02:33:45.020" style="s2">transforms itself right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:33:45.020" end="02:33:48.560" style="s2">psychological perspective it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.729" end="02:33:50.390" style="s2">the same idea now we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.560" end="02:33:51.560" style="s2">upper limit to that right because we</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.390" end="02:33:53.779" style="s2">don&#39;t know what a person would be like</p>
<p begin="02:33:51.560" end="02:33:58.390" style="s2">if they let everything that they could</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.779" end="02:34:02.120" style="s2">let go let go and only let in what was</p>
<p begin="02:33:58.390" end="02:34:03.920" style="s2">seemly let&#39;s say but you can see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.120" end="02:34:07.250" style="s2">funny we don&#39;t know that to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:34:03.920" end="02:34:10.340" style="s2">you can see people vary from you can see</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.250" end="02:34:13.250" style="s2">people start to do that without that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.340" end="02:34:16.640" style="s2">not an rare experience</p>
<p begin="02:34:13.250" end="02:34:18.260" style="s2">and people improve very rapidly they can</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.640" end="02:34:20.030" style="s2">improve their lives very rapidly a lot</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.260" end="02:34:22.400" style="s2">of its low-hanging fruit like if you</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.030" end="02:34:24.290" style="s2">just stop doing really stupid things</p>
<p begin="02:34:22.400" end="02:34:28.580" style="s2">that you know are stupid your life</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.290" end="02:34:30.410" style="s2">improves a lot so and it frees you up it</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.580" end="02:34:32.800" style="s2">also means there&#39;s a there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.410" end="02:34:35.480" style="s2">there that&#39;s also associated with pride</p>
<p begin="02:34:32.800" end="02:34:37.100" style="s2">because people tend to take pride in who</p>
<p begin="02:34:35.480" end="02:34:40.400" style="s2">they are and that&#39;s a bad idea because</p>
<p begin="02:34:37.100" end="02:34:42.080" style="s2">that stops you from becoming who you</p>
<p begin="02:34:40.400" end="02:34:42.560" style="s2">could be because if you&#39;re proud of who</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.080" end="02:34:44.420" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.560" end="02:34:46.430" style="s2">you won&#39;t let that go when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:34:44.420" end="02:34:48.260" style="s2">necessary you won&#39;t step away from it</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.430" end="02:34:51.140" style="s2">you know and then you end up being your</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.260" end="02:34:53.150" style="s2">own parody something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.140" end="02:34:55.190" style="s2">also a very bad idea you want to be</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.150" end="02:34:58.430" style="s2">continually stepping away from your</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.190" end="02:35:00.500" style="s2">previous self and so big and I guess</p>
<p begin="02:34:58.430" end="02:35:03.560" style="s2">part of that too is that you you have to</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.500" end="02:35:05.300" style="s2">decide you know are you are you order or</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.560" end="02:35:07.010" style="s2">you chaos or you the process that</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.300" end="02:35:08.930" style="s2">mediates between them and if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.010" end="02:35:11.560" style="s2">process that mediates between them you</p>
<p begin="02:35:08.930" end="02:35:13.880" style="s2">you are the thing that transforms and</p>
<p begin="02:35:11.560" end="02:35:16.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the right attitude for human</p>
<p begin="02:35:13.880" end="02:35:18.290" style="s2">being because that&#39;s what we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:35:16.250" end="02:35:21.320" style="s2">the thing that voluntarily confronts</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.290" end="02:35:24.320" style="s2">chaos and transforms that&#39;s what we are</p>
<p begin="02:35:21.320" end="02:35:27.620" style="s2">and so for better or worse you know</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.320" end="02:35:29.930" style="s2">that&#39;s our deepest biological essence</p>
<p begin="02:35:27.620" end="02:35:31.460" style="s2">you might say and so you can let things</p>
<p begin="02:35:29.930" end="02:35:35.230" style="s2">go if you know that there&#39;s more growth</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.460" end="02:35:35.230" style="s2">to come so</p>
<p begin="02:35:41.960" end="02:35:47.729" style="s2">one more thank you for your time and</p>
<p begin="02:35:45.449" end="02:35:51.989" style="s2">thank you for spending time with us hey</p>
<p begin="02:35:47.729" end="02:35:53.790" style="s2">my pleasure so if I could since we are</p>
<p begin="02:35:51.989" end="02:35:55.649" style="s2">at the end of Genesis I like the</p>
<p begin="02:35:53.790" end="02:35:57.260" style="s2">opportunity to challenge or at least</p>
<p begin="02:35:55.649" end="02:36:00.330" style="s2">have you take another look at your</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.260" end="02:36:02.399" style="s2">position you&#39;ve held with regards to</p>
<p begin="02:36:00.330" end="02:36:05.100" style="s2">Cain&#39;s reflection on the murder of evil</p>
<p begin="02:36:02.399" end="02:36:06.390" style="s2">I bring this up because it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.100" end="02:36:09.359" style="s2">part of Genesis that has bothered me for</p>
<p begin="02:36:06.390" end="02:36:11.250" style="s2">a while and it&#39;s not like because not as</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.359" end="02:36:13.590" style="s2">straightforward as its presented usually</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.250" end="02:36:16.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s really I&#39;ve been wrestling with</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.590" end="02:36:18.029" style="s2">it so in this series as well as in a</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.020" end="02:36:20.160" style="s2">couple of your maps of meaning lectures</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.029" end="02:36:22.260" style="s2">you summarized that something to the</p>
<p begin="02:36:20.160" end="02:36:24.510" style="s2">effect of Cain coming to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="02:36:22.260" end="02:36:26.040" style="s2">that what he did leads to a punishment</p>
<p begin="02:36:24.510" end="02:36:28.890" style="s2">which is more than he believes he can</p>
<p begin="02:36:26.040" end="02:36:30.630" style="s2">face which I believe to be born out of a</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.890" end="02:36:33.000" style="s2">natural reading of a specific</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.630" end="02:36:36.029" style="s2">translation choices incorrectly made or</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.000" end="02:36:39.420" style="s2">enter a innocently made by editors just</p>
<p begin="02:36:36.029" end="02:36:42.120" style="s2">for readability sake so in Genesis 4:13</p>
<p begin="02:36:39.420" end="02:36:45.020" style="s2">Cain does not say my punishment is</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.120" end="02:36:49.260" style="s2">greater than I can bear he actually says</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.020" end="02:36:52.199" style="s2">he meets my sin is greater than I can</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.260" end="02:36:55.649" style="s2">bear which is this a.m. which is to say</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.199" end="02:36:57.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not his past actions we just say</p>
<p begin="02:36:55.649" end="02:37:00.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not his past sections its futures</p>
<p begin="02:36:57.390" end="02:37:01.710" style="s2">consequences which it&#39;s just past action</p>
<p begin="02:37:00.330" end="02:37:03.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not his future consequences which</p>
<p begin="02:37:01.710" end="02:37:06.720" style="s2">he regrets for him to say our own</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.810" end="02:37:08.399" style="s2">iniquity or sin that is too much for him</p>
<p begin="02:37:06.720" end="02:37:10.109" style="s2">to bear as a reflection on the reality</p>
<p begin="02:37:08.399" end="02:37:12.569" style="s2">of his corruption and not a plea of</p>
<p begin="02:37:10.109" end="02:37:14.569" style="s2">Mercy to the deity to spare him mmm okay</p>
<p begin="02:37:12.569" end="02:37:17.640" style="s2">well that&#39;s that seems to be a deeper</p>
<p begin="02:37:14.569" end="02:37:19.830" style="s2">interpretation I would say and I think</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.640" end="02:37:22.109" style="s2">it&#39;s more that&#39;s the same line of</p>
<p begin="02:37:19.830" end="02:37:24.600" style="s2">reasoning that Dostoevsky pursued in</p>
<p begin="02:37:22.109" end="02:37:26.520" style="s2">crime and punishment right because in</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.600" end="02:37:28.560" style="s2">crime and punishment Raskolnikov gets</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.520" end="02:37:30.810" style="s2">away with murder and then he cannot</p>
<p begin="02:37:28.560" end="02:37:31.979" style="s2">stand it he cannot stand that he did it</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.810" end="02:37:34.470" style="s2">because he&#39;s no longer the same person</p>
<p begin="02:37:31.979" end="02:37:35.310" style="s2">but even more he cannot stand that he</p>
<p begin="02:37:34.470" end="02:37:38.160" style="s2">got away with it</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.310" end="02:37:41.100" style="s2">so that&#39;s more in keeping with with that</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.160" end="02:37:43.109" style="s2">interpretation so this also is reflected</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.100" end="02:37:45.569" style="s2">in the falling verse and 4:14 where he</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.109" end="02:37:47.699" style="s2">states the consequences of his actions</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.569" end="02:37:49.229" style="s2">mainly that God&#39;s presence will hot be</p>
<p begin="02:37:47.699" end="02:37:51.630" style="s2">hidden from him and that he will be</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.229" end="02:37:53.850" style="s2">killed the verse opens was the word hane</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.630" end="02:37:56.010" style="s2">which means indeed more or less</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.850" end="02:37:58.499" style="s2">and to note the sense of acceptance and</p>
<p begin="02:37:56.010" end="02:38:01.050" style="s2">not a complaint it is the difference</p>
<p begin="02:37:58.499" end="02:38:02.520" style="s2">between saying oh no well God now hide</p>
<p begin="02:38:01.050" end="02:38:04.529" style="s2">his face from me and will I be hunted</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.520" end="02:38:06.680" style="s2">versus of course God will hide his face</p>
<p begin="02:38:04.529" end="02:38:09.779" style="s2">for me and I will be hunted and killed</p>
<p begin="02:38:06.680" end="02:38:11.819" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been wrestling with and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:38:09.779" end="02:38:15.119" style="s2">taken a way to possibly mean that there</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.819" end="02:38:17.850" style="s2">are sins that we can do that will just</p>
<p begin="02:38:15.119" end="02:38:21.359" style="s2">push us too far well okay there there</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.850" end="02:38:23.789" style="s2">there are well okay so one of the well</p>
<p begin="02:38:21.359" end="02:38:25.649" style="s2">one of the things that you see in</p>
<p begin="02:38:23.789" end="02:38:27.810" style="s2">post-traumatic post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="02:38:25.649" end="02:38:30.239" style="s2">disorder situations for example is that</p>
<p begin="02:38:27.810" end="02:38:33.390" style="s2">people view themselves doing something</p>
<p begin="02:38:30.239" end="02:38:35.939" style="s2">so terrible they don&#39;t know how to put</p>
<p begin="02:38:33.390" end="02:38:37.560" style="s2">it right so that and so you could say</p>
<p begin="02:38:35.939" end="02:38:39.300" style="s2">under those circumstances the face of</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.560" end="02:38:43.260" style="s2">God is hidden from them because they</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.300" end="02:38:45.479" style="s2">cannot they cannot atone for it they</p>
<p begin="02:38:43.260" end="02:38:47.789" style="s2">can&#39;t reconcile themselves to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:38:45.479" end="02:38:49.409" style="s2">there all the time and they can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:38:47.789" end="02:38:52.649" style="s2">anything good beyond it it&#39;s hell</p>
<p begin="02:38:49.409" end="02:38:53.729" style="s2">essentially and so I mean sometimes when</p>
<p begin="02:38:52.649" end="02:38:55.560" style="s2">you&#39;re working with people with</p>
<p begin="02:38:53.729" end="02:38:58.829" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder you know</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.560" end="02:39:00.720" style="s2">you you kind of in initiate them into a</p>
<p begin="02:38:58.829" end="02:39:03.899" style="s2">philosophy of good and evil so that they</p>
<p begin="02:39:00.720" end="02:39:05.550" style="s2">can see when Joseph talks to his</p>
<p begin="02:39:03.899" end="02:39:07.709" style="s2">brothers and they&#39;ve got all this guilt</p>
<p begin="02:39:05.550" end="02:39:09.899" style="s2">right and and he doesn&#39;t want them to</p>
<p begin="02:39:07.709" end="02:39:12.180" style="s2">have more guilt than necessary to fix</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.899" end="02:39:14.640" style="s2">themselves because it just burdens them</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.180" end="02:39:16.350" style="s2">otherwise he says look don&#39;t forget yeah</p>
<p begin="02:39:14.640" end="02:39:19.619" style="s2">yeah it was you but it&#39;s also God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.350" end="02:39:21.979" style="s2">doing and I had a client once who who</p>
<p begin="02:39:19.619" end="02:39:24.779" style="s2">had obsessive-compulsive disorder and</p>
<p begin="02:39:21.979" end="02:39:26.970" style="s2">he&#39;s a very smart guy he also happened</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.779" end="02:39:28.499" style="s2">to work in a radioactive lab that had a</p>
<p begin="02:39:26.970" end="02:39:30.029" style="s2">lot of radioactive materials which</p>
<p begin="02:39:28.499" end="02:39:33.869" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the best place for someone with</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.029" end="02:39:35.999" style="s2">OCD and he was worried that he would</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.869" end="02:39:37.829" style="s2">make some mistake this is very common</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.999" end="02:39:40.470" style="s2">with OCD that would result in someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:37.829" end="02:39:43.199" style="s2">suffering which you will you&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.470" end="02:39:45.510" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t until I could get him to</p>
<p begin="02:39:43.199" end="02:39:49.499" style="s2">conceptualize himself and his life in</p>
<p begin="02:39:45.510" end="02:39:51.479" style="s2">part as a force of nature that he was</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.499" end="02:39:53.279" style="s2">able to reconcile himself to the</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.479" end="02:39:56.819" style="s2">possibility that an error on his part</p>
<p begin="02:39:53.279" end="02:39:59.129" style="s2">would produce catastrophic consequences</p>
<p begin="02:39:56.819" end="02:40:01.079" style="s2">but people often find themselves in</p>
<p begin="02:39:59.129" end="02:40:02.520" style="s2">situations where they just they cannot</p>
<p begin="02:40:01.079" end="02:40:04.169" style="s2">reconcile themselves to what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.520" end="02:40:06.419" style="s2">done and that it makes sense to me that</p>
<p begin="02:40:04.169" end="02:40:07.351" style="s2">that the interpretation that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.419" end="02:40:10.561" style="s2">describing that</p>
<p begin="02:40:07.351" end="02:40:12.030" style="s2">that makes them that makes plenty of</p>
<p begin="02:40:10.561" end="02:40:15.870" style="s2">sense from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="02:40:12.030" end="02:40:17.461" style="s2">there are sins that will push us like</p>
<p begin="02:40:15.870" end="02:40:21.001" style="s2">just beyond our limit that are too far</p>
<p begin="02:40:17.461" end="02:40:22.801" style="s2">but there are also no consequences to</p>
<p begin="02:40:21.001" end="02:40:25.200" style="s2">our actions that are devoid of a truth</p>
<p begin="02:40:22.801" end="02:40:27.480" style="s2">we can accept and learn from and this is</p>
<p begin="02:40:25.200" end="02:40:29.160" style="s2">what I&#39;ve kind of dealt out of this bit</p>
<p begin="02:40:27.480" end="02:40:31.230" style="s2">with Cain and Abel so if this is the</p>
<p begin="02:40:29.160" end="02:40:33.931" style="s2">case why then does it take us so long</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.230" end="02:40:36.030" style="s2">and with so much self - now before we</p>
<p begin="02:40:33.931" end="02:40:37.921" style="s2">accept personal responsibility when</p>
<p begin="02:40:36.030" end="02:40:44.671" style="s2">faced with tragedy especially when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:40:37.921" end="02:40:47.641" style="s2">self inflicted well I I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="02:40:44.671" end="02:40:51.051" style="s2">want to underestimate the contribution</p>
<p begin="02:40:47.641" end="02:40:56.851" style="s2">of just sheer difficulty like you know</p>
<p begin="02:40:51.051" end="02:40:59.761" style="s2">let&#39;s say you you you you&#39;re grieving</p>
<p begin="02:40:56.851" end="02:41:01.081" style="s2">because someone close to you died it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:40:59.761" end="02:41:02.791" style="s2">like well it isn&#39;t just that you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="02:41:01.081" end="02:41:05.700" style="s2">them although that&#39;s a big part of it</p>
<p begin="02:41:02.791" end="02:41:08.700" style="s2">it&#39;s that you have to rebuild yourself</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.700" end="02:41:10.851" style="s2">and it&#39;s really hard to do that so and</p>
<p begin="02:41:08.700" end="02:41:13.200" style="s2">it is sort of proportional to the</p>
<p begin="02:41:10.851" end="02:41:14.820" style="s2">significance of your error so if you</p>
<p begin="02:41:13.200" end="02:41:16.980" style="s2">commit an error and then you recognize</p>
<p begin="02:41:14.820" end="02:41:18.721" style="s2">that it&#39;s an error if it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="02:41:16.980" end="02:41:21.391" style="s2">surface error it&#39;s like well you can</p>
<p begin="02:41:18.721" end="02:41:24.211" style="s2">just touch up the paint but sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:41:21.391" end="02:41:29.631" style="s2">the whole under structure is just rotten</p>
<p begin="02:41:24.211" end="02:41:32.190" style="s2">and then you don&#39;t know what to do and</p>
<p begin="02:41:29.631" end="02:41:33.931" style="s2">then so that&#39;s one problems just sheer</p>
<p begin="02:41:32.190" end="02:41:35.551" style="s2">bloody difficulty and I see this with</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.931" end="02:41:37.860" style="s2">people very often it&#39;s like they&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="02:41:35.551" end="02:41:40.351" style="s2">point in their divorce let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="02:41:37.860" end="02:41:42.530" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what to do they cannot</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.351" end="02:41:44.910" style="s2">solve the problem it&#39;s too complicated</p>
<p begin="02:41:42.530" end="02:41:46.230" style="s2">they just don&#39;t have the resources and</p>
<p begin="02:41:44.910" end="02:41:47.851" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ve squandered some of their</p>
<p begin="02:41:46.230" end="02:41:49.530" style="s2">resources as well but sometimes they</p>
<p begin="02:41:47.851" end="02:41:51.931" style="s2">just don&#39;t have the resources and then</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.530" end="02:41:53.610" style="s2">if you add to that error and sin and</p>
<p begin="02:41:51.931" end="02:41:55.980" style="s2">malevolence and blindness and all those</p>
<p begin="02:41:53.610" end="02:41:57.660" style="s2">other things people there&#39;s a guy named</p>
<p begin="02:41:55.980" end="02:41:59.761" style="s2">Thomas SAS who wrote this really</p>
<p begin="02:41:57.660" end="02:42:01.381" style="s2">interesting article in the 1960s a book</p>
<p begin="02:41:59.761" end="02:42:06.150" style="s2">actually called the myth of mental</p>
<p begin="02:42:01.381" end="02:42:07.501" style="s2">illness and it was classic reading for</p>
<p begin="02:42:06.150" end="02:42:09.900" style="s2">clinical psychologists when I was</p>
<p begin="02:42:07.501" end="02:42:12.211" style="s2">training and the reason for that was is</p>
<p begin="02:42:09.900" end="02:42:14.730" style="s2">that SAS pointed out and this is true is</p>
<p begin="02:42:12.211" end="02:42:16.471" style="s2">that mmm-hmm lots of times if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="02:42:14.730" end="02:42:18.480" style="s2">psychotherapist people don&#39;t come to you</p>
<p begin="02:42:16.471" end="02:42:19.971" style="s2">because they have mental illnesses they</p>
<p begin="02:42:18.480" end="02:42:21.240" style="s2">had come to you because they have</p>
<p begin="02:42:19.971" end="02:42:23.221" style="s2">insoluble</p>
<p begin="02:42:21.240" end="02:42:25.710" style="s2">problems in their life you know like</p>
<p begin="02:42:23.221" end="02:42:31.380" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ve had a two-year affair at</p>
<p begin="02:42:25.710" end="02:42:33.360" style="s2">work their wife is alcoholic and they</p>
<p begin="02:42:31.380" end="02:42:35.700" style="s2">have a very and their father has</p>
<p begin="02:42:33.360" end="02:42:38.610" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s disease it&#39;s like they just</p>
<p begin="02:42:35.700" end="02:42:39.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do it&#39;s too much now</p>
<p begin="02:42:38.610" end="02:42:41.521" style="s2">you know they shouldn&#39;t have had the</p>
<p begin="02:42:39.870" end="02:42:43.440" style="s2">affair so there&#39;s a moral issue and</p>
<p begin="02:42:41.521" end="02:42:45.780" style="s2">maybe they should have intervened in the</p>
<p begin="02:42:43.440" end="02:42:47.550" style="s2">alcoholism in the family maybe they used</p>
<p begin="02:42:45.780" end="02:42:49.021" style="s2">their wives alcoholism as an excuse to</p>
<p begin="02:42:47.550" end="02:42:51.181" style="s2">have the affair you know like these</p>
<p begin="02:42:49.021" end="02:42:53.160" style="s2">things get very tangled it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:42:51.181" end="02:42:56.760" style="s2">so bloody complicated that people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:42:53.160" end="02:42:58.230" style="s2">untangle it so and I would say that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="02:42:56.760" end="02:43:00.750" style="s2">keeping with the interpretation that you</p>
<p begin="02:42:58.230" end="02:43:02.910" style="s2">laid forth with regards to cain is it</p>
<p begin="02:43:00.750" end="02:43:04.290" style="s2">sounds like that&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="02:43:02.910" end="02:43:07.620" style="s2">why it&#39;s so useful to read multiple</p>
<p begin="02:43:04.290" end="02:43:10.800" style="s2">translations right because nuances</p>
<p begin="02:43:07.620" end="02:43:12.990" style="s2">matter it sounds to me from that</p>
<p begin="02:43:10.800" end="02:43:15.150" style="s2">description that he actually woke up at</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.990" end="02:43:18.000" style="s2">least briefly and noticed what he did</p>
<p begin="02:43:15.150" end="02:43:20.580" style="s2">and said there&#39;s no coming back from</p>
<p begin="02:43:18.000" end="02:43:23.370" style="s2">this and and it is you can easily get</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.580" end="02:43:24.990" style="s2">places that you do not know how to come</p>
<p begin="02:43:23.370" end="02:43:26.580" style="s2">back from now you know they say well all</p>
<p begin="02:43:24.990" end="02:43:28.650" style="s2">things are possible with God and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:43:26.580" end="02:43:31.500" style="s2">always the possibility of redemption no</p>
<p begin="02:43:28.650" end="02:43:33.570" style="s2">matter how serious the sin but I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="02:43:31.500" end="02:43:38.521" style="s2">you sometimes people have no idea how to</p>
<p begin="02:43:33.570" end="02:43:40.110" style="s2">get back from where they went well and</p>
<p begin="02:43:38.521" end="02:43:43.351" style="s2">you can understand often why people</p>
<p begin="02:43:40.110" end="02:43:44.610" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that right yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:43:43.351" end="02:43:46.471" style="s2">a funny thing because one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:43:44.610" end="02:43:48.750" style="s2">Carl Rogers said too about psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.471" end="02:43:50.070" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t do psychotherapy with</p>
<p begin="02:43:48.750" end="02:43:52.980" style="s2">someone who hasn&#39;t recognized that they</p>
<p begin="02:43:50.070" end="02:43:54.391" style="s2">have a problem so that it&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="02:43:52.980" end="02:43:55.950" style="s2">thing to recognize that you have a</p>
<p begin="02:43:54.391" end="02:43:59.760" style="s2">problem and it does open the door</p>
<p begin="02:43:55.950" end="02:44:01.200" style="s2">perhaps to recovery but it also means</p>
