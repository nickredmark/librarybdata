<p begin="00:00:02.520" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">the hole fill the whole window I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">know a different section but no okay no</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">because I have to be able to allow</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">people to go up and down since I oppose</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">me dad it&#39;s one of the drawbacks that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">isn&#39;t that unzoom you kind of have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">one person talking and you gotta see oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.949" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">this one&#39;s missing list for recording</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">and having people come on without</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">needing to download anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">so the done part number who started it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">was Hyatt Kylie did you start this but</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">it was me yeah how did you envision this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">going what is the process I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">the thing I&#39;m interested in first didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:58.309" style="s2">like leave work from into Landry&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">on ethics that I think didn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.309" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">original game game be so yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I was it a reading or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">video um it was I think it was linked to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">it&#39;s more of an audio so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">podcast rather than that rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">video it was really long it was like in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">three hours</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">I mean listen to it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">how many conversation I might not be</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">participated in as I could read your</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">post if you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">Kylene Oh before it goes right yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">over the past few days since I joined</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:44.220" style="s2">this group and listen to Forrest</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">laundry&#39;s first public podcast on ethics</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.220" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s number as pointing not only to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">our capacity for meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:55.549" style="s2">relationships but rather to a more core</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:59.869" style="s2">capacity of human cognitive function</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.549" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">which is the net number of 7 + -2</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.869" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">indicates the capacity of our short-term</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">memory function which I&#39;d love for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">to elaborate it elaborate on we scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">the utility of our short-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">function by chunking information on our</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.890" style="s2">long-term memory and manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">those chunks instead of raw data the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:19.790" style="s2">idea I&#39;m playing with us that we use the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">same scaling technique in dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.790" end="00:02:26.360" style="s2">complexity ie V chunk as aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">complexity included including but not</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.360" end="00:02:31.340" style="s2">restricted to human relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:33.410" style="s2">expectation models that we can retrieve</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.340" end="00:02:36.739" style="s2">and use for in the moment since making</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.410" end="00:02:40.910" style="s2">and choice making and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.739" end="00:02:42.670" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much it that so yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.910" end="00:02:48.100" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.670" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">well so one short-term memory number</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.100" end="00:02:53.239" style="s2">this is one that I learned like years</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">and years ago and I think it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.239" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2">pretty accurate which is they found it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.480" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like most people can manage between</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.970" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">five and nine pieces of information and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">hold them in short-term memory and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:10.880" style="s2">manipulate them so like we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">seven digit phone numbers here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.880" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">Australia and it&#39;s like everyone could</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:17.209" style="s2">remember each other&#39;s phone numbers so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:20.150" style="s2">this was before um before Mobile&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.209" end="00:03:22.850" style="s2">before they&#39;re in wide use and and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.150" end="00:03:24.829" style="s2">they added an extra digit and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.850" end="00:03:28.459" style="s2">sudden people couldn&#39;t remember phone</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.829" end="00:03:31.100" style="s2">numbers anymore so this was the example</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.459" end="00:03:34.850" style="s2">that was used in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.100" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">lecture that I was in and what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.850" end="00:03:38.390" style="s2">struck me about it was that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:39.950" style="s2">just the phone numbers but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.390" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">chunks of information so we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.950" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">remember like seven years for instance</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.569" style="s2">you know I with the four digits because</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve chunk it into a into a year in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.569" end="00:03:53.329" style="s2">minds or lumbers or words or phrases or</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:54.980" style="s2">you know whatever the case may be so</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.329" end="00:03:57.049" style="s2">long as we&#39;d actually learned whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.980" end="00:04:00.530" style="s2">that was we could manipulate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.049" end="00:04:02.299" style="s2">information you know as well as long as</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.530" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">it was store would be in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.299" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">memory so but it was still you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:07.639" style="s2">seven plus or minus two chunks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">people have different ranges of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.639" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">they can actually deal with so when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">was listening to forest talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.150" end="00:04:20.660" style="s2">how we have these two different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">deciding whether something is right or</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.660" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">wrong making making sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:26.900" style="s2">if you like which was the asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.460" end="00:04:30.050" style="s2">which is kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">same thing in different contexts so same</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">content different contexts an example if</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">that is like the golden rule or the you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">know the the even the non Ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">Commandments or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:43.910" style="s2">where it&#39;s like you go okay this is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">is the rule that we&#39;re going to apply</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.910" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">now this behavior fit that rule or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:51.860" style="s2">like so fairly straightforward so same</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:54.139" style="s2">content different contexts and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.860" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">other one was this continuity tracking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.139" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">which is the kind of thing that we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:05:02.419" style="s2">when we&#39;re in really watch them change</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:07.160" style="s2">sort of at a steady kind of continuous</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.419" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">rate over time so most of our laws and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.160" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">so on seem to be set up on this symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">principle of saying you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:20.330" style="s2">this is what you shall do this is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:23.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t do and check instead of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.330" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">applying like more of a principle kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.150" end="00:05:27.320" style="s2">of way of looking at things something</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:29.509" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of more suitable to as I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.320" end="00:05:31.130" style="s2">it to complexity so in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.509" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">you know everything is changing all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.130" end="00:05:35.389" style="s2">time but we kind of develop we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">develop over time like an expectation</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.389" end="00:05:40.520" style="s2">according to the patterns of rates of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:43.669" style="s2">changing one thing compared to rates of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.520" end="00:05:46.099" style="s2">change another thing so as I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.669" end="00:05:49.159" style="s2">listening to this you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.099" end="00:05:54.139" style="s2">certainly seen that we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.159" end="00:05:56.659" style="s2">problems with law where you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.139" end="00:05:58.820" style="s2">situation changes slightly and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.659" end="00:06:01.400" style="s2">still trying to apply the same hard rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.820" end="00:06:10.010" style="s2">to it you know you end up with all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.400" end="00:06:12.229" style="s2">of perverse effects no way and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.010" end="00:06:14.060" style="s2">trying to apply the principle to the to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.229" end="00:06:17.539" style="s2">the new situation so it&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.060" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2">continuity sort of thing anyway it says</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.539" end="00:06:22.849" style="s2">struck me that by the time we put these</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:25.250" style="s2">two things together so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.849" end="00:06:28.430" style="s2">continuity and symmetry ways of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.250" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">processing on the one hand and Dunbar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.430" end="00:06:32.539" style="s2">number which is about managing</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:34.729" style="s2">relationships on the other hand the wall</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.539" end="00:06:36.979" style="s2">relationships are pretty complex so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.729" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">we&#39;re probably using continuity tracking</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.979" end="00:06:40.820" style="s2">to to manage relationships in much the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:45.490" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.820" end="00:06:45.490" style="s2">way as we do that sort of long-term</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.940" end="00:06:51.170" style="s2">doping one clam in our memory to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.310" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">manipulate for that short-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.170" end="00:06:55.820" style="s2">thing so I thought well you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:58.460" style="s2">say that we&#39;ve got an overall capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.820" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">the same as we do for short-term to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.460" end="00:07:13.040" style="s2">long-term memory well I&#39;ve got a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:14.120" style="s2">complex well and what happens if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.040" end="00:07:15.850" style="s2">know like in the course of dealing with</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.120" end="00:08:02.660" style="s2">well I think that she&#39;s onto something</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.940" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been questioning like I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">ethics and morals and kind of comparing</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:35.390" style="s2">question of you know this coming into</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">space of liminality</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.390" end="00:08:41.570" style="s2">I think has a lot to do with where our</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:44.410" style="s2">stances on morals and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.570" end="00:08:47.980" style="s2">principles we&#39;ve developed for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.410" end="00:08:52.610" style="s2">to guide our actions with other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.980" end="00:08:54.400" style="s2">in that sense so the more a space there</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.610" end="00:08:57.970" style="s2">is for the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.400" end="00:09:02.580" style="s2">the less right and wrongs there are and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:02.580" style="s2">so the more we can come into coherence</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:10.690" style="s2">your back yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.300" end="00:09:12.220" style="s2">internet from your router maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.690" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">a possibility I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re far</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.220" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">from your router then that could be a</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:56.440" style="s2">I do like yeah I know that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.740" end="00:09:58.960" style="s2">complexity like the more complex the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.440" end="00:10:03.340" style="s2">world is we have other slots to hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.960" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">information and yeah it affects our</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.340" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">Dunbar number how many people we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">have actual connection with when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">dealing with the complexity of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">and the world is just gonna get more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">more complex and complicated at the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:21.220" style="s2">time and so how do we deal with both of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:23.020" style="s2">those things there was something when</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">Kiley well she&#39;s getting situated said</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.020" end="00:10:26.890" style="s2">about the phone numbers right that seven</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:28.990" style="s2">digits is most people can remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.890" end="00:10:30.520" style="s2">between five and nine right and so seven</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.990" end="00:10:32.740" style="s2">digits won&#39;t be added one won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.520" end="00:10:34.090" style="s2">everything blow up partly because there</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.740" end="00:10:36.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a threshold of people that could</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.090" end="00:10:37.900" style="s2">remember them but seven never worked for</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.610" end="00:10:39.970" style="s2">the people who could only remember five</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.900" end="00:10:41.080" style="s2">and the new eight digits definitely</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.970" end="00:10:43.990" style="s2">worked for people who remember nine</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.080" end="00:10:45.430" style="s2">right if it became a law instead where</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:46.690" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to be part of society</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.430" end="00:10:49.030" style="s2">unless you can remember at least six</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.690" end="00:10:51.460" style="s2">digits right like that is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.030" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s like well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.460" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">be able to react to anger in this way if</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be part of civil society</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:10:58.150" style="s2">and the outliers are you know maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:10:59.140" style="s2">not we don&#39;t give you any tools to deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.150" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">with that we&#39;re just like you&#39;re broken</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.140" end="00:11:03.430" style="s2">you can&#39;t remember that many that many</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">digits and as our world gets more and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.430" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">more complex I find that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:10.420" style="s2">things happen right like you might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:11.380" style="s2">really good at numbers but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.420" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.380" end="00:11:16.120" style="s2">you know the interpersonal skills so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know and so the more we have a bar</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:20.710" style="s2">that everybody has to get perfect right</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:23.530" style="s2">everyone has to be good enough at math</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.710" end="00:11:26.170" style="s2">and science and this and that the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.530" end="00:11:28.090" style="s2">complicated we&#39;re making it instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.170" end="00:11:30.340" style="s2">like wait what are you good at and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.090" end="00:11:32.050" style="s2">do we fit you into the whole so that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.340" end="00:11:34.180" style="s2">can feel like you&#39;re contributing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.050" end="00:11:36.940" style="s2">the whole gets your contribution without</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.180" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">requiring anyone do what they can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.940" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">right making it a law that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">remember seven numbers isn&#39;t gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:45.940" style="s2">people who can&#39;t remember seven numbers</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">and that same like I feel like that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.940" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with complexity is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:51.550" style="s2">so many people are having breakdowns</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:53.710" style="s2">because our world&#39;s gotten so complex so</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.550" end="00:11:54.820" style="s2">like I can&#39;t hold all that information</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.710" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.820" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">and the more smart you are the more you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.940" style="s2">know that but also the more you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:02.920" style="s2">hold information and so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.940" end="00:12:06.280" style="s2">like there&#39;s something tied to like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.920" end="00:12:08.230" style="s2">disability inability movement and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.280" end="00:12:09.910" style="s2">Dunbar number with complexity of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.230" end="00:12:11.800" style="s2">right I already know I can&#39;t handle the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.910" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">basic crap that society throws at us so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.800" end="00:12:14.770" style="s2">I&#39;m good like I know I can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">keep my house clean get food on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.770" end="00:12:18.970" style="s2">table and so I already know I have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:21.610" style="s2">let go of a lot of the complexity and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.970" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">but in doing so taught me that like okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.610" end="00:12:26.290" style="s2">I have something new to give it&#39;s the in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:27.940" style="s2">that space that um I&#39;m still figuring</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.290" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">out how to give because it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.940" end="00:12:32.140" style="s2">done in a way that society likes which</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:34.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to go together was that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.140" end="00:12:37.270" style="s2">raising your hand or Landis yes I have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.840" end="00:12:39.280" style="s2">response to what you just shared yes it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.270" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">seems like maybe you&#39;ve like adjourned</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.280" end="00:12:45.970" style="s2">to concepts that I think it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:47.740" style="s2">to even separate them to you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.970" end="00:12:51.490" style="s2">the examples you gave is like a demand</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.740" end="00:12:54.640" style="s2">to kind of to meet a certain standard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.490" end="00:12:57.100" style="s2">kind of hop as high as like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.640" end="00:12:59.710" style="s2">else right like a you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.100" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">required and then if not and you will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.710" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">excluded or even maybe punished you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:09.330" style="s2">put into jail for not being good enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">but then this so this is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.330" end="00:13:14.200" style="s2">addressing maybe the the negative rights</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">like or negative freedoms you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.200" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not even free to be yourself even</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.810" end="00:13:21.380" style="s2">if you&#39;re not harming anybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.470" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another part where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.380" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">might not be coerced to be better you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:29.080" style="s2">know to force to to address certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:31.460" style="s2">requirements but you&#39;re still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.080" end="00:13:33.230" style="s2">neglected and that&#39;s what you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.460" end="00:13:35.090" style="s2">with those other examples where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.230" end="00:13:38.390" style="s2">just not cared for if you&#39;re not meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.090" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">those standards is like yeah you may</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.390" end="00:13:43.400" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not correct to call it like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.460" end="00:13:45.740" style="s2">you have a right for education or or or</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.400" end="00:13:47.750" style="s2">health or whatever because it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.740" end="00:13:50.750" style="s2">then as if it&#39;s not like somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.750" end="00:13:54.230" style="s2">that&#39;s forced to give those things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.750" end="00:13:57.910" style="s2">you but more like you need health you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.230" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">need education you need caretaking and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.910" end="00:14:03.350" style="s2">all those are like called positive</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:06.500" style="s2">rights or positive freedoms and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.350" end="00:14:09.080" style="s2">distinction is is is important because</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.500" end="00:14:11.330" style="s2">in some ideological positions they say</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.080" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">I&#39;m coming from a libertarian position</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.330" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">mostly so in that sense there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:19.190" style="s2">you know don&#39;t infringe on me don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:22.460" style="s2">don&#39;t force me to do certain things but</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.190" end="00:14:24.650" style="s2">and and a lot of ideas about how the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.460" end="00:14:26.750" style="s2">economics should run so that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.650" end="00:14:29.030" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a coercion that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.750" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">interaction in the free market but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.030" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">the ideas from the well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:34.550" style="s2">libertarian right but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:36.710" style="s2">libertarian left we&#39;re saying that well</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.550" end="00:14:37.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not enough we also have many</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.710" end="00:14:40.460" style="s2">people who cannot take care of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:44.030" style="s2">themselves and and then we need this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.460" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2">kind of a more involved more collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.030" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">solution maybe and so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:50.930" style="s2">distinction is a lot about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:52.700" style="s2">having that of all those political</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.930" end="00:14:55.610" style="s2">debates where it&#39;s more like those</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.700" end="00:14:58.490" style="s2">negative freedoms like don&#39;t infringe on</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.610" end="00:15:01.130" style="s2">me I am free to choose what I do and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.490" end="00:15:03.080" style="s2">then how do we care about about</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:07.010" style="s2">everybody else so this actually comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.080" end="00:15:09.290" style="s2">back to the game the issue that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.010" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">that some people they don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.290" end="00:15:12.380" style="s2">much responsibility to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">others but they are okay with not</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.380" end="00:15:16.670" style="s2">enforcing others and others are well</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.650" style="s2">okay we still want to care for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.670" end="00:15:20.450" style="s2">not everyone is collaborating well we</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.650" end="00:15:22.730" style="s2">have to force a little bit or find</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.450" end="00:15:25.130" style="s2">somehow like to restrict those people</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.730" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">like not allow money to be used or</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.130" end="00:15:29.769" style="s2">whatever so this is actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:32.739" style="s2">essential point I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.769" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">and and it just is reiterated in various</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.739" end="00:15:41.309" style="s2">cases so maybe that&#39;s just a bottom to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">chat here yeah it&#39;s very complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.309" end="00:15:46.989" style="s2">I like forests</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:51.779" style="s2">I think the podcast started off with</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.989" end="00:15:51.779" style="s2">love is that which enables choice and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.319" end="00:15:58.149" style="s2">building our own set of principles also</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.509" end="00:16:01.049" style="s2">enables choice so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.149" end="00:16:04.290" style="s2">sovereignty is the idea of self-love</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.049" end="00:16:06.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like allowing ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.290" end="00:16:10.209" style="s2">make the decisions the best decisions</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.850" end="00:16:11.309" style="s2">for ourselves that keep us in in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.209" end="00:16:13.869" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.309" end="00:16:16.689" style="s2">so integrity and that enable the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.869" end="00:16:18.819" style="s2">choice for the self and the other so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.689" end="00:16:24.279" style="s2">keep on coming back to this idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.819" end="00:16:25.989" style="s2">we are if we are continuously you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.279" end="00:16:28.299" style="s2">in forming this space within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.989" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">and developing this process for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.299" end="00:16:33.670" style="s2">ourselves then we are always open to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.459" style="s2">making the best choices for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.670" end="00:16:38.350" style="s2">and the people around us and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.459" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">being able to stay in that space long</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.350" end="00:16:45.819" style="s2">enough for a synthesis to occur whereas</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:47.740" style="s2">right now I think because of the morals</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.819" end="00:16:49.660" style="s2">and the values and the rigid ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.740" end="00:16:51.579" style="s2">ideologies we don&#39;t stay in that space</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.660" end="00:16:54.730" style="s2">long enough and then that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.579" end="00:16:58.179" style="s2">conflict just doesn&#39;t budge and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.730" end="00:17:00.790" style="s2">no movement forward so you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.179" end="00:17:04.209" style="s2">really you know but obviously people</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.790" end="00:17:06.699" style="s2">have to they have to agree to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.209" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">process of you know building sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.699" end="00:17:11.559" style="s2">for themselves and creating their own</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:13.510" style="s2">principles and then updating them</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.559" end="00:17:15.669" style="s2">regularly and staying in that space</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.510" end="00:17:17.589" style="s2">because if the other person isn&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.669" end="00:17:18.939" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of hard to work with them</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.589" end="00:17:21.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s where I think the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.939" end="00:17:24.159" style="s2">challenge is coming into coherence with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.970" end="00:17:25.270" style="s2">other people if they&#39;re working from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.159" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">completely different model and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.270" end="00:17:28.870" style="s2">don&#39;t want to work on themselves they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.169" style="s2">not interested in meeting their own</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.870" end="00:17:35.830" style="s2">basic needs on the hierarchy of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.169" end="00:17:38.020" style="s2">muscle therapy of needs then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.830" end="00:17:40.809" style="s2">difficult to make the decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.020" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">support the self and that nourish</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.809" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">yourself enough to be able to include</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:47.950" style="s2">the other eye I just want a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">clarification are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.950" end="00:17:52.870" style="s2">essentially about responsibility taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:54.610" style="s2">responsibility for yourself for your</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.870" end="00:17:56.170" style="s2">games yeah it&#39;s part of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.610" end="00:17:57.790" style="s2">definitely I think a really important</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.170" end="00:18:00.670" style="s2">part like for the base because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.790" end="00:18:02.590" style="s2">not taking care of your needs then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.670" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">very difficult to take care of someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.590" end="00:18:07.660" style="s2">else&#39;s needs or to even be in a space</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">where you&#39;re open to being able to hear</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.660" end="00:18:16.330" style="s2">the needs of the other person um I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">actually known as well it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.330" end="00:18:20.230" style="s2">being in touch I think with your own</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:23.890" style="s2">needs and continually meeting them</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.230" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a complex endeavor all by itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.890" end="00:18:32.770" style="s2">I think so I&#39;m not sure where I got cut</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:35.620" style="s2">off before I just wanted to know it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.770" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">to wrap up the last little bit of it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.620" end="00:18:39.669" style="s2">the sense that so I&#39;m not sure if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">know the difference between complicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.669" end="00:18:44.470" style="s2">and complex system as some days Snowden</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:46.360" style="s2">talks about it so when we&#39;ve got all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.470" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">these laws set up like the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.360" end="00:18:50.530" style="s2">some you know we&#39;re just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.070" end="00:18:53.380" style="s2">there then what you end up with is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.530" end="00:18:55.660" style="s2">very complicated and brittle kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.380" end="00:18:57.880" style="s2">system right as opposed to complex but</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.660" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">as it breaks down everything is complex</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.880" end="00:19:02.410" style="s2">like trying to find all the workarounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">and trying to deal with the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.410" end="00:19:06.540" style="s2">break and so on and then on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:08.380" style="s2">basis you know we you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.540" end="00:19:09.669" style="s2">bureaucracy or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.380" end="00:19:11.169" style="s2">try to fill out the administration</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.669" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">paperwork and it doesn&#39;t quite fit so</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.169" end="00:19:15.309" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got all the complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">comes up with it not having worked in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.309" end="00:19:20.950" style="s2">that place so you end up using I think a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:23.559" style="s2">lot of you know if we do actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.950" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">limited amount of ability to to deal</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:28.120" style="s2">with complexity and to use that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:30.280" style="s2">continuity tracking then I think we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.120" end="00:19:32.770" style="s2">might use it all up during the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.280" end="00:19:34.210" style="s2">dealing with with that kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.770" end="00:19:37.030" style="s2">then not end up with a huge amount left</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.210" end="00:19:39.570" style="s2">for our relationships so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.030" end="00:19:44.590" style="s2">our relationships then we often end up</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.570" end="00:19:46.330" style="s2">using roles so you know that we relate</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.590" end="00:19:48.669" style="s2">to each other in terms of like a job</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.330" end="00:19:50.580" style="s2">title or something like that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.669" end="00:19:53.140" style="s2">as the complex people that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.580" end="00:19:55.549" style="s2">because we just don&#39;t have anything left</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.140" end="00:19:58.429" style="s2">to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.549" end="00:20:01.190" style="s2">you know the deep conversations and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.429" end="00:20:04.730" style="s2">deep relationships with each other that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.190" end="00:20:07.309" style="s2">that we might otherwise have so the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.730" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">thesis that I had with the with Dunbar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.309" end="00:20:11.869" style="s2">number was kind of going well you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:13.730" style="s2">he started as as far as I know from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.869" end="00:20:16.340" style="s2">assumption that this was about just</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.730" end="00:20:18.830" style="s2">human relationships I&#39;m thinking if it</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.340" end="00:20:20.499" style="s2">was about complexity in general our</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.830" end="00:20:22.610" style="s2">ability to actually deal with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.499" end="00:20:24.860" style="s2">then maybe what that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.610" end="00:20:28.119" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s number represents is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.860" end="00:20:30.289" style="s2">left to us to deal with relationships</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.119" end="00:20:33.109" style="s2">after we&#39;ve already dealt with all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.289" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">other complexity in the world so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.109" end="00:20:38.570" style="s2">more the more systems are breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:40.609" style="s2">and the more complexity is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.570" end="00:20:42.859" style="s2">popping up as a result of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.609" end="00:20:48.190" style="s2">breaking down the less we have available</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.859" end="00:20:54.379" style="s2">for for relationships so anyway that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.190" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">spot-on yeah I just want to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.379" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">introduce Jordan Peterson here into that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:01.999" style="s2">because it kind of relates to the order</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:05.869" style="s2">and chaos thing I am developing a model</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.999" end="00:21:08.149" style="s2">of my own and a part of that is is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.869" end="00:21:11.029" style="s2">kind of this balance between boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.149" end="00:21:13.639" style="s2">and channels or open open spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.029" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">we we kind of have to balance out which</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.639" end="00:21:19.549" style="s2">things we&#39;re trying to protect and which</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:21.320" style="s2">we are staying open to and connecting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.549" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">people obviously involves channels</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.320" end="00:21:26.869" style="s2">otherwise we cannot maintain those</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:28.700" style="s2">relations but with open channels we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.869" end="00:21:30.889" style="s2">new information and the more information</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.700" end="00:21:32.659" style="s2">we get the more that represents change</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.889" end="00:21:37.299" style="s2">and when we have a lot of changes like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.659" end="00:21:40.279" style="s2">tornado so it becomes chaotic right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.299" end="00:21:42.470" style="s2">if we have chaos in other areas of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.279" end="00:21:44.419" style="s2">lives obviously we will have to manage</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.470" end="00:21:46.279" style="s2">we will have to create more order and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.419" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">that can be just a regular change I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.279" end="00:21:50.029" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">just Facebook notifications lots of new</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.029" end="00:21:55.609" style="s2">things coming in it&#39;s not even important</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:59.149" style="s2">but we notice that we get triggered to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.609" end="00:22:02.710" style="s2">pay attention and constant rate of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.149" end="00:22:05.210" style="s2">change that in terms of continuity then</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.710" end="00:22:07.190" style="s2">maybe those changes are small but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.210" end="00:22:08.140" style="s2">they&#39;re rather fast and we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.190" end="00:22:09.580" style="s2">to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.140" end="00:22:14.260" style="s2">well it&#39;s creating a different</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.580" end="00:22:16.450" style="s2">environment so it taxes us and then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.260" end="00:22:19.630" style="s2">want to try to shut off some of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.450" end="00:22:23.950" style="s2">channels and then disengage from some</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.630" end="00:22:25.720" style="s2">people or some media in order to still</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.950" end="00:22:29.170" style="s2">cope with that information that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.720" end="00:22:33.190" style="s2">already accumulated so the the chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.170" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">order kind of gets represented in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.190" end="00:22:42.520" style="s2">as well watching um future thinkers did</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:45.820" style="s2">a YouTube a new video they&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.520" end="00:22:47.680" style="s2">series this one was called what we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.820" end="00:22:50.940" style="s2">why we get defensive and what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.680" end="00:22:54.770" style="s2">about it and Mike talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.940" end="00:22:55.980" style="s2">basically that hundred they like I am</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.660" end="00:23:32.370" style="s2">individual centric and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:34.540" style="s2">I&#39;m like I have identities that I do</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.920" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">or just this one and the reason this of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.120" style="s2">like affects the Dunbar summer is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:06.310" style="s2">the complexity of like not having that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.120" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">circle like not identifying with the</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:16.750" style="s2">like how you find your tribe and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:19.770" style="s2">piece of the vulnerability that exists</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.750" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">when a tribe has a monopoly on your life</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:27.130" style="s2">was a tribe right it was 150 people that</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:29.680" style="s2">think meet all of your needs right</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.600" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">you&#39;re working with them you&#39;re playing</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:36.070" style="s2">they&#39;re like a community a tribe whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:38.170" style="s2">because of the complexity my version of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.070" end="00:24:40.060" style="s2">Dunbar number now is this Venn diagram</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.170" end="00:24:42.010" style="s2">right I am autistic that&#39;s part of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.060" end="00:24:43.390" style="s2">like so maybe I have 30 people that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.010" end="00:24:44.770" style="s2">connect with in that community and 30</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.390" end="00:24:49.410" style="s2">people I connect with in the disability</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.770" end="00:24:51.190" style="s2">community and and my Dunbar number is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.410" end="00:24:52.900" style="s2">combination of all these communities so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.190" end="00:24:56.070" style="s2">I&#39;m a piece of all them and on the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.900" end="00:24:58.540" style="s2">they know that ties them together yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:25:01.930" style="s2">because of the complexity in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.540" end="00:25:03.430" style="s2">our numbers shrinking and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.930" end="00:25:05.560" style="s2">just like I&#39;m still playing it out my</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.430" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">hub but like the idea that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.560" end="00:25:08.500" style="s2">identify with the group&#39;s were part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:10.900" style="s2">but identifying with them because</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.500" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">they&#39;re how we find our tribe making a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.900" end="00:25:15.160" style="s2">system that allows anyone to leave their</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:17.800" style="s2">tribe and find a new ones they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.160" end="00:25:19.540" style="s2">have that rigidity within one or one</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.800" end="00:25:22.150" style="s2">becomes a monopoly on your life I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.540" end="00:25:24.820" style="s2">for me that&#39;s a lot of the energy that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.150" end="00:25:28.180" style="s2">exists around the game bSpace is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.820" end="00:25:29.620" style="s2">idea of show like I don&#39;t think I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.180" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">ever get kicked out of it I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.620" end="00:25:34.270" style="s2">there is a space here but like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:35.980" style="s2">that worry there&#39;s that underlining fear</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.270" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">of like but then what like where do I</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.980" end="00:25:39.940" style="s2">find other game changers did have</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.870" end="00:25:42.190" style="s2">conversations with right if that did</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.940" end="00:25:45.040" style="s2">happen and so I show up a little less</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.190" end="00:25:47.740" style="s2">myself than I would if that wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.040" end="00:25:49.240" style="s2">case right and so having that be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.740" end="00:25:50.830" style="s2">case when you&#39;re an Asha white</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.240" end="00:25:53.770" style="s2">nationalist right think about leaving</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.830" end="00:25:55.300" style="s2">that movement and you have to leave all</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.300" end="00:26:01.090" style="s2">and all you can see is an abyss of empty</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:03.160" style="s2">emptiness if it was easy to find a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.090" end="00:26:04.120" style="s2">tribe if the tools existed where you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.160" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">could come on and have a conversation</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.820" end="00:26:11.650" style="s2">not I don&#39;t like the monopolies that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.400" end="00:26:15.570" style="s2">tribes have on your life is the amount</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.800" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">that single group lessens the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.140" style="s2">right I actually kind of want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.820" end="00:26:24.580" style="s2">a tribe where I eat play and do</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.140" end="00:26:25.930" style="s2">everything together Swiper so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.580" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">need to know thirty people here are 30</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.930" end="00:26:29.830" style="s2">people here everyone knows everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:31.660" style="s2">great that&#39;s a lot less complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.830" end="00:26:34.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a complex like there&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.660" end="00:26:36.010" style="s2">that&#39;s added with the complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.450" end="00:26:37.960" style="s2">like I said like</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.010" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">a part of all these groups and so on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.960" end="00:26:41.350" style="s2">connecting node that brings down the</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.350" end="00:26:47.170" style="s2">node and I&#39;m not expected to be the</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.170" end="00:26:50.680" style="s2">of my groups including the autistic one</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.790" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">the epitome of a queer person in all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.680" end="00:26:54.310" style="s2">my groups you know I mean like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:56.620" style="s2">the essence of the thing what makes me</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.310" end="00:26:59.710" style="s2">queer what makes me autistic once I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.620" end="00:27:01.630" style="s2">that I get to choose which things I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.710" end="00:27:04.360" style="s2">if I can choose them right like Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.630" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just all of it playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.360" end="00:27:12.490" style="s2">together yeah that was kind of linking</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.090" style="s2">back to me to what Sandra Landis was</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.490" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">saying but the the order and chaos as</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.090" end="00:27:20.020" style="s2">well so I think probably the more that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:22.180" style="s2">you have in common with the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.020" end="00:27:25.300" style="s2">around me the more ordered it feels and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.180" end="00:27:27.670" style="s2">the idea of lately of being kicked out</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.300" end="00:27:30.160" style="s2">of that tribe as you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.670" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">fleetingly referred to there yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.160" end="00:27:35.470" style="s2">there any bigger form of chaos for most</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:38.470" style="s2">of us then than that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.470" end="00:27:40.450" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s I mean the the order chaos</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.470" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">when it&#39;s an interesting sort of binary</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.450" end="00:27:51.880" style="s2">that you know I think you know maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:55.800" style="s2">line between the two of them and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.880" end="00:27:58.600" style="s2">trying to sort of keep you know enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.800" end="00:28:00.550" style="s2">relationship with the people in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.600" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">groups you know like you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.550" end="00:28:06.070" style="s2">about legibly but without getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:07.480" style="s2">completely drawn into it to the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.070" end="00:28:09.580" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got like really strong</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.480" end="00:28:12.090" style="s2">barriers that go up around it and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:16.360" style="s2">becomes too watered and it becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.090" end="00:28:19.810" style="s2">constrictive go for anyway it was really</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.360" end="00:28:22.690" style="s2">interesting thank you and actually that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.810" end="00:28:25.630" style="s2">relates to this concept of symmetry that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.690" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">was referred to as if we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.630" end="00:28:29.740" style="s2">tribe yeah we&#39;re continuing there we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">wanting things to be the same and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.740" end="00:28:34.570" style="s2">there&#39;s this huge shift when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:37.210" style="s2">kicked out and it&#39;s unilaterally I want</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.570" end="00:28:40.030" style="s2">to also introduce that term because this</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.210" end="00:28:43.240" style="s2">revolves around consent like if both</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.030" end="00:28:47.350" style="s2">parties are consenting they will be able</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.240" end="00:28:49.560" style="s2">to figure out that continuty thing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.350" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">how how to continue if</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.560" end="00:28:54.750" style="s2">unilateral if somebody says you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:57.420" style="s2">either it&#39;s course if abusive or or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.750" end="00:29:00.180" style="s2">just like abandonment in any case its</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.420" end="00:29:02.220" style="s2">unilateral and that&#39;s what we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.180" end="00:29:05.790" style="s2">fearing because that breaks that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.220" end="00:29:09.060" style="s2">continuity and that&#39;s yeah also</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.790" end="00:29:11.790" style="s2">introducing chaos but also depriving us</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.060" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">from what we had but what was stable for</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.790" end="00:29:19.350" style="s2">us it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a fact we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">being robbed of those things not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.350" end="00:29:24.690" style="s2">because we got used to them but because</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:30.780" style="s2">we get we essentially need to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.690" end="00:29:35.000" style="s2">attached and it is natural and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.780" end="00:29:37.860" style="s2">stuff from conformity there&#39;s stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.000" end="00:29:39.900" style="s2">boredom are filled about attachment that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.860" end="00:29:43.560" style="s2">is relating to that many other authors</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.900" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">that is natural for us humans to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.560" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">bonded to people who rely on both on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:53.310" style="s2">protection and on this mutual exchange</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:29:55.530" style="s2">of resources to meet the needs so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.310" end="00:30:00.180" style="s2">why we need that continuity and not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.530" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">symmetry because that&#39;s our biology that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.180" end="00:30:11.490" style="s2">to be dependent and the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:13.530" style="s2">continuously takes us back into that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.490" end="00:30:15.720" style="s2">place like this is that model is just so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.530" end="00:30:18.570" style="s2">great you know sovereignty intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.720" end="00:30:19.680" style="s2">and agency it&#39;s constantly being in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.570" end="00:30:22.250" style="s2">space where we&#39;re taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.680" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">ourselves enough to be able to identify</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.250" end="00:30:28.500" style="s2">to bring our best forward and then to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:30.300" style="s2">also have the other person bringing</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.500" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">their best word and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.300" end="00:30:34.410" style="s2">constantly coming to that space of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:36.990" style="s2">coherence with each other but again</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.410" end="00:30:39.960" style="s2">everybody has to be adopting that model</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.990" end="00:30:43.110" style="s2">and then and then the symmetry is there</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.960" end="00:30:47.910" style="s2">right whatever they like about being me</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.110" end="00:30:51.210" style="s2">is that you know it proposes a way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.910" end="00:30:54.500" style="s2">being in the world so I don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.210" end="00:30:59.670" style="s2">so much as a tribe as I do a mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.500" end="00:31:03.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of freedom it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.670" end="00:31:07.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot about being curious</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.950" end="00:31:10.440" style="s2">discovering you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.220" end="00:31:12.780" style="s2">discovering what&#39;s emerging be present</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.440" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">with that whereas you know for using</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.780" end="00:31:16.610" style="s2">WebEx I li was singing about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:20.309" style="s2">expectation models and the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.610" end="00:31:22.380" style="s2">finance takes me out of that space where</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.309" end="00:31:25.380" style="s2">things are so rigid and and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.380" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">expecting anything from any of you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.380" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">I&#39;m you know because game be I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:32.220" style="s2">game be space right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:35.850" style="s2">representing skiing with what is arising</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.220" end="00:31:38.790" style="s2">and so a lot of the projections so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.850" end="00:31:40.860" style="s2">had from negative experiences are less</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.790" end="00:31:43.530" style="s2">likely to be projected onto anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.860" end="00:31:45.000" style="s2">labels as well right so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.530" end="00:31:46.890" style="s2">like about the game be it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.000" end="00:31:52.050" style="s2">not so much about the labels it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.890" end="00:31:53.910" style="s2">much about who identify with or what</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.050" end="00:31:56.670" style="s2">certain ideologies or religion and their</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.910" end="00:31:59.460" style="s2">politics it&#39;s really about just being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.670" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">the present like in presence with what</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.460" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">is rising and moving into this game so</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.700" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">it feels really to see in yeah and just</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:19.350" style="s2">very see don&#39;t see and yes I love that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.360" end="00:32:22.679" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to go ditto and also look</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.350" end="00:32:25.230" style="s2">at in that um I find you&#39;re not real a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.679" end="00:32:28.110" style="s2">maker and allow for and generally what</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.230" end="00:32:29.720" style="s2">some you know what you might think of is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.110" end="00:32:34.170" style="s2">almost like the guiding sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.720" end="00:32:37.830" style="s2">principles or framework of of game be to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.170" end="00:32:41.309" style="s2">be very much the continuity way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.830" end="00:32:44.160" style="s2">little things rather than symmetry so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.309" end="00:32:46.530" style="s2">think that that that they look blue in</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.160" end="00:32:49.110" style="s2">there you know is it seems to enable us</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.530" end="00:32:52.970" style="s2">in these kinds of conversations and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.110" end="00:32:55.950" style="s2">been involved in it in a few now to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.970" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2">relate to each other on the basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.950" end="00:33:00.740" style="s2">particular topic and there&#39;s all of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:04.290" style="s2">the moving and dancing around it that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:07.650" style="s2">you expect to see from a from dealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.290" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">with complexity you know whereas say</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.650" end="00:33:10.920" style="s2">within a within a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.140" end="00:33:12.390" style="s2">organization or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.920" end="00:33:14.940" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anywhere near as many</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.390" end="00:33:16.980" style="s2">degrees of freedom because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.940" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">restricted according to what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.980" end="00:33:19.980" style="s2">you know the rights and responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">are that are associated with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.100" style="s2">particular role and actually this was so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:27.630" style="s2">a bit of a sidetrack yeah but this was</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.100" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">one of the main things that I took out</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.630" end="00:33:32.220" style="s2">of listening to Forrest Landry&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:35.250" style="s2">know three-hour conversation on ethics</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.220" end="00:33:37.260" style="s2">because I&#39;ve discovered one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.250" end="00:33:39.990" style="s2">biggest issue that I&#39;ve had in the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.260" end="00:33:44.450" style="s2">place that I worked was when I went into</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.990" end="00:33:47.280" style="s2">a went into a role for a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.450" end="00:33:49.980" style="s2">that was actually my boss&#39;s role and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.280" end="00:33:52.860" style="s2">I was sort of managing the team if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.980" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">like and then mine sort of temporary</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.860" end="00:33:57.480" style="s2">boss asked me to do something that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:33:59.850" style="s2">sort of well within my skill set and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.480" end="00:34:02.760" style="s2">within our previous sort of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.850" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">so continuous if you like as far as that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.760" end="00:34:07.500" style="s2">goes but was very different from the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:10.710" style="s2">that the team had experienced that role</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.500" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">before so I went ahead and did it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.710" end="00:34:14.659" style="s2">without sort of thinking too much about</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.030" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">it and they all felt completely betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.659" end="00:34:20.280" style="s2">because they had that they had that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:23.129" style="s2">expectation of symmetry or continuity</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.280" end="00:34:26.750" style="s2">with the role like as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.129" end="00:34:29.399" style="s2">continuity with me which that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.750" end="00:34:31.109" style="s2">they expected the role to sort of keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.399" end="00:34:33.960" style="s2">their relationship with the role to keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.109" end="00:34:36.980" style="s2">being the same and it completely changed</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.960" end="00:34:39.240" style="s2">so I thought that was some like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.980" end="00:34:54.899" style="s2">absolutely fascinating insight and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.240" end="00:34:57.270" style="s2">picked up some more stuff there because</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.950" end="00:37:09.730" style="s2">on it that really goes into the details</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">of it that I find explains it well but</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.730" end="00:37:17.110" style="s2">it&#39;s getting rid of all this stuff keeps</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.690" end="00:37:21.640" style="s2">us locked in rolls in in the labels of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.110" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">the rules so that we&#39;re still ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.640" end="00:37:28.210" style="s2">and what we&#39;re allowing to emerge is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">just that that pure essence of self in</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.210" end="00:37:37.720" style="s2">that moment so the responsibility is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">solely to that for that space within you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.720" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">know because the rules are so rigid and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.670" end="00:37:47.030" style="s2">are the titles but where were poor</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">beings right we&#39;re so much more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.030" end="00:37:51.349" style="s2">that that encompasses all of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.970" style="s2">complexity so to move forward with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.349" end="00:37:56.150" style="s2">complexity you need to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.970" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">complexity and so I find that&#39;s it just</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.150" end="00:38:03.589" style="s2">yeah it takes me in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:05.960" style="s2">removes all of the the titles I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.589" end="00:38:08.420" style="s2">know if that answers your question um</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.960" end="00:38:09.619" style="s2">well it does that it also brings up</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.420" end="00:38:13.250" style="s2">something else that I&#39;m wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.619" end="00:38:15.470" style="s2">so do you think it is possible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.250" end="00:38:18.220" style="s2">just the derma kind of question out</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.470" end="00:38:23.480" style="s2">there do you think it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:26.089" style="s2">change a lot of things know the rules</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.480" end="00:38:28.130" style="s2">the roles the Lords the the ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.089" end="00:38:31.510" style="s2">unite so these these tight boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.130" end="00:38:36.760" style="s2">that we&#39;ve put on to order things from</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.510" end="00:38:39.829" style="s2">the symmetry base to a continuity base</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.760" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">so to actually take it away from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.829" end="00:38:44.630" style="s2">match from one thing to another so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:46.460" style="s2">thou shalt not and instead moving to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.630" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">something more like what we have in game</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.460" end="00:38:53.809" style="s2">B which is a Triton sort of generally</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:59.960" style="s2">move in this direction now try to bear</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.809" end="00:39:02.210" style="s2">this principle in mind yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.960" end="00:39:04.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very forgiving you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.210" end="00:39:06.170" style="s2">because we&#39;re holding with holding</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.760" end="00:39:08.780" style="s2">responsibility for ourselves in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.170" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">space here at the scene when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.780" end="00:39:13.819" style="s2">falling out of that you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">in the rigidity of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.819" end="00:39:20.750" style="s2">and if everybody&#39;s holding that space</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:22.280" style="s2">then the mirror is very clear so I find</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.750" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to self-correct because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.280" end="00:39:27.020" style="s2">is a Phoebe as a self-correcting model</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:29.809" style="s2">right everybody&#39;s held responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.020" end="00:39:32.630" style="s2">themselves and to continuously self</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.809" end="00:39:35.369" style="s2">practice as things come up things will</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.630" end="00:39:38.670" style="s2">come up and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.369" end="00:39:40.980" style="s2">you notice it easier to notice any beam</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.670" end="00:39:43.410" style="s2">being space because it&#39;s safer to feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.980" end="00:39:45.210" style="s2">into the parts that are you know not</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.410" end="00:39:48.180" style="s2">feeling worthy or not feeling loved or</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.210" end="00:39:50.999" style="s2">you know feeling competent or you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.180" end="00:39:54.299" style="s2">identifying too much with the role and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.999" end="00:39:59.519" style="s2">then to self-correct that and move again</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.299" end="00:40:02.009" style="s2">into that little space yeah I would like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.519" end="00:40:05.009" style="s2">to add to that in kind of referring to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.009" end="00:40:08.039" style="s2">you Elaine becoming enlightened in a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.009" end="00:40:10.349" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you get there once even</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.039" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re kind of getting in and out</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.349" end="00:40:14.549" style="s2">rubbed out of that consciousness where</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:17.009" style="s2">you&#39;re realizing that more like a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.549" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">sense of existence you might not be</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.009" end="00:40:20.809" style="s2">performing it as well but after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">gone there at least once or like with</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.809" end="00:40:25.740" style="s2">psychedelics or anything it becomes much</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:28.470" style="s2">easier to keep coming back to those</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.740" end="00:40:31.490" style="s2">principles so in terms of how possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.470" end="00:40:34.559" style="s2">it is I think it&#39;s very possible and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.490" end="00:40:36.509" style="s2">probably the issue is not not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.559" end="00:40:40.829" style="s2">where we&#39;re looking that the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.509" end="00:40:44.069" style="s2">problem may be is that mostly it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.829" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">first step that is difficult that many</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.069" end="00:40:48.359" style="s2">people just haven&#39;t experienced that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:50.999" style="s2">even once and they they have no</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.359" end="00:40:53.339" style="s2">imagination of it being possible they</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.999" end="00:40:55.140" style="s2">just have no conception of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.339" end="00:40:56.730" style="s2">like if you have never seen a bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.140" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">you would not even think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.730" end="00:41:02.039" style="s2">possible to ride it and then we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:05.069" style="s2">even talking about the skill of writing</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.039" end="00:41:09.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like not even in your mind so</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.069" end="00:41:12.569" style="s2">I think the the reason why we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:15.619" style="s2">good things is because we&#39;re not having</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.569" end="00:41:18.869" style="s2">that experience that it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.619" end="00:41:21.239" style="s2">because many people that most of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.869" end="00:41:25.470" style="s2">time is spent in a different experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.239" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">and and when some people get there over</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.470" end="00:41:31.619" style="s2">that threshold then it becomes much</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:33.150" style="s2">easier and obviously certain agreements</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.619" end="00:41:35.130" style="s2">and rules like rule make or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.150" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">they help to maintain that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:40.950" style="s2">but I think even without those somehow</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:44.010" style="s2">the own intuition is already there</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.950" end="00:41:45.810" style="s2">there&#39;s more trust and somehow people</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.010" end="00:41:48.270" style="s2">you know no matter how many made</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.810" end="00:41:52.110" style="s2">mistakes you make you still are on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:57.090" style="s2">different page already so my concern is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.110" end="00:41:59.820" style="s2">I guess that probably we&#39;re missing how</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.090" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">to involve everybody else because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.820" end="00:42:05.430" style="s2">still a very small group and if agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">with Nass know that you know most people</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.430" end="00:42:10.350" style="s2">are down at the lowest level just taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:14.460" style="s2">care of their survival and then only a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.350" end="00:42:17.210" style="s2">few people are self actualizing maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.460" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">that is the biggest issue not how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.210" end="00:42:21.870" style="s2">maintain and maintain it is obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:24.540" style="s2">is difficult the resources are limited</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.870" end="00:42:26.940" style="s2">in a sense we have to keep communicating</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.540" end="00:42:29.000" style="s2">and figuring it out but more like how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.940" end="00:42:31.530" style="s2">first get everybody on the same page</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.000" end="00:42:33.540" style="s2">because not everybody wants to go to an</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.530" end="00:42:35.580" style="s2">ashram and just meditate first for some</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.540" end="00:42:37.470" style="s2">time to just become enlightened right</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.580" end="00:42:41.370" style="s2">and everybody is busy running around</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.470" end="00:42:45.810" style="s2">doing their stuff so how to get people</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.370" end="00:42:47.970" style="s2">into the tribe or whatever because you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.810" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">can&#39;t force them you know you can break</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.970" end="00:42:55.170" style="s2">the the horse to the water but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:57.990" style="s2">cannot make him drink so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.170" end="00:43:00.780" style="s2">of all the things that are going on in</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.990" end="00:43:03.000" style="s2">the group and it seems like there&#39;s many</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.900" end="00:46:41.920" style="s2">clarification here are you implying that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:44.809" style="s2">like you would like somebody to take the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:50.539" style="s2">responsibility for that then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.809" end="00:46:54.019" style="s2">would ensure that those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.539" end="00:46:55.490" style="s2">maybe not realizing that there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.019" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">know there&#39;s something missing in their</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.490" end="00:47:00.259" style="s2">communication that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.660" end="00:47:02.390" style="s2">informed more proactively and and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.259" end="00:47:05.480" style="s2">in inclusivity and all those things is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.390" end="00:47:07.069" style="s2">that about that yes no I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.480" end="00:47:09.049" style="s2">that that is like yes you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.069" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">responsible for that so you&#39;re not okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.049" end="00:47:13.339" style="s2">but like as a group or responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">that right if people come here and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.339" end="00:47:17.329" style="s2">don&#39;t feel included they&#39;re gonna leave</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.890" style="s2">without ever telling us why right</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.890" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">exit interview like it was too complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.079" end="00:47:23.809" style="s2">of language and I felt like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:25.910" style="s2">knew each other and I wasn&#39;t included</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.809" end="00:47:27.559" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be a real thing it probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.910" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">already is a real thing right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.559" end="00:47:30.440" style="s2">well I&#39;m not invited to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:33.349" style="s2">conversations because there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.440" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">top tier of like you know Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.349" end="00:47:38.089" style="s2">Daniel they like that like we all want</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.380" end="00:47:44.210" style="s2">watched and there&#39;s the the next tier</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.690" end="00:47:45.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not like ferns but like people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.210" end="00:47:47.000" style="s2">I know show up to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.500" end="00:47:48.920" style="s2">conversations and there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.000" end="00:47:50.119" style="s2">people who don&#39;t feel comfortable being</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.920" end="00:47:51.619" style="s2">on camera don&#39;t even know if they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.289" end="00:48:00.410" style="s2">welcome to participate on camera that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.940" end="00:48:02.180" style="s2">there&#39;s internal work they have to need</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.410" end="00:48:04.849" style="s2">to be comfortable with that but like</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.180" end="00:48:08.839" style="s2">that you&#39;re welcome here yes and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.849" end="00:48:12.829" style="s2">you&#39;re not is there a process for why</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.839" end="00:48:14.089" style="s2">right like to be told listen you do this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.829" end="00:48:17.000" style="s2">too much and I don&#39;t want to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.089" end="00:48:20.029" style="s2">group with you because of it is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.000" end="00:48:21.650" style="s2">safer it&#39;s hugely safer than all of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.029" end="00:48:24.170" style="s2">stuff in your head that you assume is</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.650" end="00:48:24.620" style="s2">the reason right like well here&#39;s the 12</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.170" end="00:48:26.090" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.620" end="00:48:27.620" style="s2">it could have been the reason and no</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.090" end="00:48:29.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not really responsible to each</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.620" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">other but if our group wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.480" end="00:48:33.940" style="s2">cohesive and move forward we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">need to like have that exit interview</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.940" end="00:48:41.390" style="s2">portion like why are people leaving and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">also like be able to have metrics of</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.390" end="00:48:46.490" style="s2">like do I feel included and if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:48.170" style="s2">why not and if someone isn&#39;t how do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.490" end="00:48:50.060" style="s2">include I don&#39;t know like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.170" end="00:48:51.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a group piece and an individual</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.060" end="00:48:53.570" style="s2">piece and we kind of need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.530" end="00:48:56.270" style="s2">both of them but it won&#39;t be on one</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.570" end="00:49:06.530" style="s2">person I have a bunch of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.270" end="00:49:11.210" style="s2">are coming up my expectation model your</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.530" end="00:49:14.180" style="s2">expectation of well there&#39;s the I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.210" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">love that there&#39;s a space to come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:18.380" style="s2">with other people who want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:24.980" style="s2">better world and having the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.380" end="00:49:27.770" style="s2">conversations and the the population of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.980" end="00:49:30.770" style="s2">people who&#39;s interested in that is game</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.770" end="00:49:33.500" style="s2">B is but I have a particular game B</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.770" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">project that filters everything through</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.500" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">it because I&#39;m like why are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:39.800" style="s2">this thing and so like that is is my</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:41.930" style="s2">thing to to deal with I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.800" end="00:49:43.670" style="s2">that&#39;s game be necessary that isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.930" end="00:49:48.100" style="s2">how I think we get to game B or I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.670" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be doing it but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.100" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">because I have this project that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:54.740" style="s2">like everyone&#39;s a bit anyone can come</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.740" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">there is no anyone who wants to can come</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.570" end="00:50:00.290" style="s2">participate in it I don&#39;t feel like any</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:02.840" style="s2">of the other projects are like that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.290" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m not included in any of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.840" end="00:50:06.950" style="s2">other projects if that makes it a game B</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.460" style="s2">yeah the conversation the like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.950" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">that is is inclusive but like oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.460" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">creating this technology we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:17.870" style="s2">this for doing that isn&#39;t and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:21.320" style="s2">truth to that that like we can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.870" end="00:50:23.600" style="s2">thousand people on this conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.320" end="00:50:28.750" style="s2">can only have four we have six if it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.600" end="00:50:31.400" style="s2">the actual factory with stream yard but</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.750" end="00:50:33.050" style="s2">anyone can have this conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.400" end="00:50:36.220" style="s2">Anu six people to have a new</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.050" end="00:50:37.670" style="s2">conversation and so for me finding</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.220" end="00:50:38.869" style="s2">solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.670" end="00:50:40.280" style="s2">omni wind that are like hot i like</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.869" end="00:50:42.859" style="s2">taking a step back and saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.280" end="00:50:45.020" style="s2">creating this tool one time would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.859" end="00:50:46.609" style="s2">really powerful so that we can just come</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.020" end="00:50:49.670" style="s2">on have a conversation with anyone at</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.609" end="00:50:52.339" style="s2">any point in time i want a system to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.670" end="00:50:54.020" style="s2">able to contribute my gifts to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.339" end="00:50:55.609" style="s2">everyone can contribute their gifts to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.020" end="00:50:56.780" style="s2">without needing to change and i feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.609" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">like i didn&#39;t answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">i find it well how I see it how I</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.849" style="s2">interpret game B&#39;s on part of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.200" style="s2">different groups so I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.849" end="00:51:07.910" style="s2">comparisons sort of like you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.200" end="00:51:09.819" style="s2">mentioning earlier to you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.910" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">that I compared game B to other groups</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.819" end="00:51:17.480" style="s2">and what I&#39;ve learned over time is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:20.780" style="s2">there is no final moment right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.480" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">all in a work-in-progress and you come</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.780" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">to these different groups and then we</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:35.690" style="s2">get inspired with me I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:38.599" style="s2">about the inspiration that we can draw</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.690" end="00:51:40.750" style="s2">from it so I&#39;m feeling like you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.599" end="00:51:43.609" style="s2">inspired by creating this technology</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.750" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">right and if you look at everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.609" end="00:51:47.569" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any hierarchy so for me</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:50.690" style="s2">Jordan Hall is the same as Jubilee like</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.569" end="00:51:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing and he developed his</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.690" end="00:51:55.400" style="s2">ideas in his interest and where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.000" end="00:51:57.500" style="s2">going and you are now talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.400" end="00:51:59.240" style="s2">where your interest where you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.500" end="00:52:00.770" style="s2">where you&#39;re developing your interests</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.240" end="00:52:02.900" style="s2">and what your point if it&#39;s found on</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.770" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">they almost feel like you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.900" end="00:52:08.059" style="s2">players to play in developing this</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:10.460" style="s2">technology and you haven&#39;t found them</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.059" end="00:52:12.710" style="s2">yet correct me if I&#39;m wrong that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.460" end="00:52:15.260" style="s2">absolutely I have a like I have a player</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.710" end="00:52:17.150" style="s2">but like it&#39;s it&#39;s a yeah I want a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.260" end="00:52:18.859" style="s2">group of people to play at how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.150" end="00:52:21.829" style="s2">create something that anyone can play at</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.859" end="00:52:24.109" style="s2">and my communication of it isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.829" end="00:52:26.089" style="s2">like it&#39;s like it&#39;s not and I get that</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.109" end="00:52:28.520" style="s2">but the question is why why are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.089" end="00:52:31.099" style="s2">players not coming what meaning is it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.520" end="00:52:33.740" style="s2">it you know I mean is it my first thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.099" end="00:52:35.990" style="s2">is whenever I&#39;m in that feeling space</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.740" end="00:52:38.990" style="s2">it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t cultivated enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.990" end="00:52:40.579" style="s2">with that project on my own so I go back</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.990" end="00:52:43.910" style="s2">to the drawing board and then work</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.579" end="00:52:45.380" style="s2">internally on what it is so you see you</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.910" end="00:52:47.089" style="s2">know different people kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.380" end="00:52:49.540" style="s2">bringing forth their own material that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.089" end="00:52:51.220" style="s2">they&#39;ve worked on individually and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.540" end="00:52:53.050" style="s2">and then it starts to flourish from</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.220" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">there so I think there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.050" end="00:52:56.950" style="s2">amount of work the hard work that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:53:00.490" style="s2">have to do on our own before people</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.950" end="00:53:02.470" style="s2">start becoming attracted to it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.490" end="00:53:04.390" style="s2">like we have to sort of propose a model</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.470" end="00:53:07.300" style="s2">like no one&#39;s gonna propose that model</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.390" end="00:53:09.700" style="s2">for us because you need the inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.300" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">is coming from self so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.700" end="00:53:13.630" style="s2">know thinking our hands in getting them</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:16.240" style="s2">dirty and sort of creating something the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.630" end="00:53:19.120" style="s2">best we can that we can then bring forth</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.240" end="00:53:21.190" style="s2">and that will attract other people so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.120" end="00:53:24.190" style="s2">find there&#39;s a lot of like people</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.190" end="00:53:26.710" style="s2">creating on that level and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.190" end="00:53:28.450" style="s2">every idea is going to attract you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.710" end="00:53:29.530" style="s2">but then a few of them will and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.450" end="00:53:30.940" style="s2">that&#39;s when the collaboratory</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.530" end="00:53:32.980" style="s2">collaborators come in and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.940" end="00:53:35.200" style="s2">co-creators because those are the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.980" end="00:53:36.790" style="s2">ones of the group so it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.200" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">personal thing it&#39;s like collectively</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.790" end="00:53:42.520" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging what is the what are we</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:44.410" style="s2">prioritizing collectively so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.520" end="00:53:46.360" style="s2">of how I see it but I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.410" end="00:53:48.190" style="s2">frustration and so for me I always just</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.360" end="00:53:50.070" style="s2">go back and hope in my own personal work</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.190" end="00:53:51.940" style="s2">when I feel like I&#39;m not having</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.070" end="00:53:53.410" style="s2">magnetizing that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.940" end="00:53:55.840" style="s2">co-creators that I want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.410" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">project with and then going into that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.840" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">space it&#39;s like you know the inner</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:04.660" style="s2">reflex on the outer and then I just work</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:05.890" style="s2">with that sort of symmetry yeah that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.660" end="00:54:08.200" style="s2">that is I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.890" end="00:54:09.730" style="s2">intertwined it&#39;s like this big idea my</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.200" end="00:54:11.170" style="s2">interpersonal work and all of it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.730" end="00:54:14.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like allowing it to progress and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.170" end="00:54:16.210" style="s2">come through is is it but what I feel I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.290" end="00:54:18.220" style="s2">have or don&#39;t have that everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.210" end="00:54:22.060" style="s2">does and everyone else seems to have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.220" end="00:54:24.700" style="s2">thing they can present that is hey</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.060" end="00:54:27.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the 10 page document here is I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.700" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">can&#39;t do that like every time I sit down</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.400" end="00:54:31.120" style="s2">to do that my nervous system shuts down</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:34.780" style="s2">and and like even before I had my brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.120" end="00:54:36.490" style="s2">injury there was a lot of like um like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.780" end="00:54:38.290" style="s2">could create a world but I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.490" end="00:54:40.300" style="s2">write the story and I feel like that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.290" end="00:54:43.780" style="s2">the position I&#39;m in on this planet is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.300" end="00:54:45.310" style="s2">that I have 60% of the way there but not</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.780" end="00:54:46.990" style="s2">the hundred percent right and like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.310" end="00:54:48.490" style="s2">can&#39;t present somebody with a storyline</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.990" end="00:54:50.020" style="s2">and expect them to write the book you</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.490" end="00:54:52.060" style="s2">can&#39;t expect so you don&#39;t I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.020" end="00:54:53.590" style="s2">that&#39;s the issue it&#39;s like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.060" end="00:54:55.330" style="s2">to create something which is what I keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.590" end="00:54:56.650" style="s2">doing and I love it but then I have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.330" end="00:54:58.210" style="s2">explain it to someone and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.650" end="00:54:59.800" style="s2">explain it to someone so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.210" end="00:55:02.200" style="s2">create it so that I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.800" end="00:55:03.339" style="s2">explain it to you so we created it</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.200" end="00:55:05.530" style="s2">like getting a group of people together</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.339" end="00:55:07.420" style="s2">to say how do we create a communication</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.530" end="00:55:09.880" style="s2">tool that works for us right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.420" end="00:55:13.420" style="s2">create something that is going to power</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.880" end="00:55:15.880" style="s2">not my game B project but our game B</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.420" end="00:55:17.349" style="s2">project and projects right like what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.880" end="00:55:18.670" style="s2">the thing that you can bring it to and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.349" end="00:55:20.560" style="s2">so I get it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.670" end="00:55:22.119" style="s2">yes it&#39;s like the thing isn&#39;t ready for</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.560" end="00:55:24.490" style="s2">people to see the vision and come on</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.119" end="00:55:25.930" style="s2">board but it&#39;s never gonna get there</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.490" end="00:55:27.849" style="s2">without the people on board to create</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.930" end="00:55:29.650" style="s2">the vision and so it&#39;s this constant</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.849" end="00:55:32.619" style="s2">chicken and egg thing of me you try to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.650" end="00:55:33.730" style="s2">be like what can I offer that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.619" end="00:55:36.010" style="s2">will get on board and I&#39;m doing the best</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.730" end="00:55:38.500" style="s2">I can I&#39;m putting videos out there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.010" end="00:55:40.420" style="s2">happy a part of conversations but there</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.500" end="00:55:42.430" style="s2">just feels like there&#39;s this piece of me</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.420" end="00:55:45.190" style="s2">that&#39;s off and I don&#39;t even look I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.430" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">even looking to fix it but like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.190" end="00:55:49.089" style="s2">off and that people are like that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:50.530" style="s2">they just told me that thing I could fix</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.089" end="00:55:52.450" style="s2">it but nobody even wants to tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.530" end="00:56:02.859" style="s2">thing because I don&#39;t know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.450" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">just this constant feeling behind it I</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.859" end="00:56:06.819" style="s2">you know I have similar I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:08.260" style="s2">everybody here has similar I can</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.819" end="00:56:11.290" style="s2">resonate a lot with what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.260" end="00:56:13.780" style="s2">and so for me I&#39;m more like the Esper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.290" end="00:56:15.970" style="s2">Asperger&#39;s side of things so I see in</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.780" end="00:56:17.109" style="s2">patterns so you know finding cope</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.970" end="00:56:20.500" style="s2">readers isn&#39;t so easy</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.109" end="00:56:22.990" style="s2">but what I&#39;ve understood is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.500" end="00:56:24.460" style="s2">not it&#39;s about also honing in like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.990" end="00:56:27.310" style="s2">sovereignty is understanding what our</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">role is and where what we&#39;re meant to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.310" end="00:56:30.880" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s not about creating</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:34.300" style="s2">that project and when there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">resistance it&#39;s like being able to let</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.300" end="00:56:39.069" style="s2">it go and saying okay where where are my</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:41.250" style="s2">gifts and talents calling me and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.069" end="00:56:44.290" style="s2">might not be where you thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.250" end="00:56:46.630" style="s2">right and and and then but being okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.290" end="00:56:49.089" style="s2">with that in an opening in that space to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.630" end="00:56:53.290" style="s2">what is emerging and then moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.089" end="00:56:54.430" style="s2">that and you know obviously I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.290" end="00:56:57.670" style="s2">either way you can of course other</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.430" end="00:56:58.780" style="s2">people to to co-create with something</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.670" end="00:57:00.040" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re not being called</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.780" end="00:57:01.450" style="s2">to so it&#39;s so it&#39;s like yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.040" end="00:57:03.310" style="s2">recognition of that but then it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.450" end="00:57:06.190" style="s2">the gift of like okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.310" end="00:57:08.260" style="s2">because something else is more deserving</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.190" end="00:57:10.359" style="s2">of my time something else though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.260" end="00:57:14.859" style="s2">gonna benefit another aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.359" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">project more you know and it&#39;s just open</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.859" end="00:57:18.470" style="s2">to that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.880" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of how I see it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.470" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to let go of a lot of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.880" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">ideas you know killing your darlings</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.430" end="00:57:32.500" style="s2">killing your darlings saying no too many</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.350" end="00:57:34.970" style="s2">things that are yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.500" end="00:57:37.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually very funny for me because</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.970" end="00:57:39.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve been already listening to many</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.100" end="00:57:42.020" style="s2">things that you&#39;ve said and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.290" end="00:57:44.390" style="s2">like clicking and I&#39;m enjoying to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.020" end="00:57:46.250" style="s2">how my model applies it makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.390" end="00:57:48.200" style="s2">I&#39;m just getting more confirmations and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.250" end="00:57:50.060" style="s2">now you&#39;re talking about something and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.200" end="00:57:52.790" style="s2">Thank You Jessica for that kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.060" end="00:57:54.920" style="s2">insight for me here cuz like two hours</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.790" end="00:57:56.510" style="s2">ago I was solving the same issue of some</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.920" end="00:57:58.010" style="s2">people I was talking about yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.510" end="00:58:00.380" style="s2">I want to attract people but also</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.010" end="00:58:02.630" style="s2">respect their boundaries and make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.380" end="00:58:04.670" style="s2">easy enough for them to join in and not</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.630" end="00:58:07.360" style="s2">be coercive in any kind of way or even</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.670" end="00:58:09.890" style="s2">imply that there&#39;s a kind of a demand</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.360" end="00:58:12.980" style="s2">but at the same time I want them to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.890" end="00:58:15.770" style="s2">responsibility to be partners in that so</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.980" end="00:58:18.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like the same things it&#39;s so lovely</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.770" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">to get that perspective of yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.710" end="00:58:22.580" style="s2">fully ready I still need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:25.210" style="s2">how to present it and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.580" end="00:58:27.890" style="s2">been working on for some years almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.210" end="00:58:31.550" style="s2">still working on it but I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.890" end="00:58:33.500" style="s2">closer to sharing it so completely off</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.550" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">the Dunbar tract but you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.500" end="00:58:38.390" style="s2">this is an interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">because part of my issue is this and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.390" end="00:58:42.590" style="s2">someone can help me figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:44.360" style="s2">in any way is that there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.590" end="00:58:46.010" style="s2">people have their own idea right their</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.360" end="00:58:48.290" style="s2">own idea for a platform their own idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.010" end="00:58:50.600" style="s2">for new currency any white like none of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.290" end="00:58:52.340" style="s2">us seem to want to like let it go and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.600" end="00:58:53.930" style="s2">start from ground zero right which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.340" end="00:58:55.610" style="s2">what I&#39;m I&#39;m like finally ready to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.930" end="00:58:57.160" style="s2">but then no one else it&#39;s like right but</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.610" end="00:59:02.150" style="s2">even that clearly I&#39;m not at Ground Zero</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.160" end="00:59:03.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like how cuz then I know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.150" end="00:59:05.900" style="s2">supposed to just create it and give it</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.230" end="00:59:08.270" style="s2">to people that it is what I&#39;m giving is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.900" end="00:59:09.380" style="s2">this process is like showing the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.270" end="00:59:10.970" style="s2">you have to go through to create</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.380" end="00:59:13.610" style="s2">something in the world is partly the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.970" end="00:59:14.930" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m giving so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.610" end="00:59:16.220" style="s2">create the thing other people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.930" end="00:59:17.180" style="s2">to go through that in the future right</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.220" end="00:59:18.770" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to find your community</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.180" end="00:59:19.970" style="s2">your community&#39;s easy to find you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.770" end="00:59:25.660" style="s2">need to do your marketing your marketing</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.970" end="00:59:28.670" style="s2">sort here but the question is like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.660" end="00:59:29.270" style="s2">to grow as individuals we have to be I</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.670" end="00:59:31.370" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.270" end="00:59:32.900" style="s2">it&#39;s its group learning right like for</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.370" end="00:59:34.610" style="s2">me I&#39;ve kind of done all the growing I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.900" end="00:59:36.080" style="s2">can do as an individual I can&#39;t sit and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.610" end="00:59:37.670" style="s2">meditate any longer it might not look</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.080" end="00:59:40.340" style="s2">that way but like I&#39;ve been doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.670" end="00:59:41.960" style="s2">years and years and years and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.340" end="00:59:43.310" style="s2">be in community with other people where</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.960" end="00:59:45.500" style="s2">like emotions are brought up because</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.310" end="00:59:47.450" style="s2">someone else says okay that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.500" end="00:59:51.140" style="s2">have come up otherwise in order for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.450" end="00:59:52.790" style="s2">group to do something I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.140" end="00:59:56.030" style="s2">effective if you have a project if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.790" end="00:59:57.890" style="s2">have something to like focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.030" end="00:59:59.480" style="s2">also brings out the emotion and also</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.890" end="01:00:01.310" style="s2">does all those things what I want is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.480" end="01:00:03.380" style="s2">group of people to figure it to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.310" end="01:00:05.600" style="s2">conversations and pick a project that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:00:05.600" end="01:00:11.570" style="s2">issue it&#39;s like I&#39;m not even asking the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.430" end="01:00:12.410" style="s2">question um the people have their own</p>

<p begin="01:00:24.260" end="01:00:27.320" style="s2">know what I&#39;m asking but like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.880" end="01:00:28.700" style="s2">create something when we all have our</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.320" end="01:00:31.100" style="s2">own baby and we&#39;re not willing to let it</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:43.820" style="s2">to say in terms of a base technology and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.490" end="01:00:45.380" style="s2">in terms of that idea of um you know how</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.820" end="01:00:47.480" style="s2">do you bring people together who are</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.380" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">thinking about the same kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.480" end="01:00:53.720" style="s2">and working on multiple projects and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:56.540" style="s2">set up something called um practice</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.720" end="01:00:59.690" style="s2">Orion and the idea with this thing is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.540" end="01:01:01.670" style="s2">actually have people who want to look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.690" end="01:01:03.850" style="s2">like wicked problems in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.670" end="01:01:06.110" style="s2">that can include individual as well as</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.850" end="01:01:09.800" style="s2">you know as well as group or anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.110" end="01:01:11.990" style="s2">else to come together share stories talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.800" end="01:01:14.570" style="s2">things through share research join</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.990" end="01:01:17.540" style="s2">projects do all of that kind of stuff so</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.570" end="01:01:20.570" style="s2">I think that a lot of it is about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.540" end="01:01:23.090" style="s2">actually attracting enough people in and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.570" end="01:01:25.850" style="s2">having it you know in an organized</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.090" end="01:01:28.550" style="s2">enough fashion that people can sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.850" end="01:01:29.930" style="s2">filter through everything that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.550" end="01:01:33.830" style="s2">and find the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.930" end="01:01:36.710" style="s2">actually interested in um having having</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.830" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">input - so Jubilee I mean I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.710" end="01:01:40.760" style="s2">to you and I&#39;m kind of going oh I could</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:42.260" style="s2">help a bit with that and it&#39;s like no no</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.760" end="01:01:44.710" style="s2">actually I can&#39;t do that because I just</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.260" end="01:01:44.710" style="s2">don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.790" end="01:01:50.010" style="s2">but you know a lot of it is about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.700" end="01:01:54.510" style="s2">not putting something together in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.010" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">frame that that people can understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.510" end="01:01:58.170" style="s2">well enough to know whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.920" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">attracted to it or not yeah I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.170" end="01:02:01.740" style="s2">so we just started talking at the really</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:04.470" style="s2">you know before everyone came on in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.740" end="01:02:07.980" style="s2">conversation about the about the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.470" end="01:02:10.410" style="s2">technology for communication so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.980" end="01:02:12.060" style="s2">still not clear yet on on what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.410" end="01:02:14.760" style="s2">about and you know we&#39;d only just</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.060" end="01:02:17.010" style="s2">started talking about it but if there is</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.760" end="01:02:18.660" style="s2">something sort of small that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.010" end="01:02:21.660" style="s2">kind of that&#39;s written up or is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.660" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">attractor if you like the people then I</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.660" end="01:02:27.480" style="s2">think that people actually will become</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:29.100" style="s2">will become attracted to it now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.480" end="01:02:30.810" style="s2">started talking I think one of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.100" end="01:02:32.870" style="s2">previous conversations about something</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.810" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">I&#39;m working on which is a proposal for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.870" end="01:02:37.980" style="s2">global Commons trust and stewardship</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:40.260" style="s2">system and I&#39;m basically at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.980" end="01:02:42.990" style="s2">working with one other person to pull</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.260" end="01:02:44.580" style="s2">together a proposal for you know the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.990" end="01:02:45.690" style="s2">funding to you know and this is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.580" end="01:02:48.780" style="s2">sound weird pulling together a proposal</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.690" end="01:02:50.730" style="s2">for a smallish amount of funding to put</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.780" end="01:02:53.700" style="s2">together a multimedia proposal to get a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.730" end="01:02:56.310" style="s2">large amount of funding and this first</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.700" end="01:02:59.460" style="s2">sort of you know we&#39;re kind of crafting</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.310" end="01:03:01.890" style="s2">the seed at the moment you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.460" end="01:03:04.620" style="s2">we want to put the seed into it you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.890" end="01:03:06.810" style="s2">plug into an environment where it can</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.620" end="01:03:08.280" style="s2">actually be a seedling and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.810" end="01:03:09.990" style="s2">from there to have it grow into</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.280" end="01:03:11.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s this big and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.990" end="01:03:14.790" style="s2">that that seems to be the usual kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.960" end="01:03:16.470" style="s2">processes pulling whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.790" end="01:03:19.620" style="s2">individual ideas and giving it just</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.470" end="01:03:23.100" style="s2">enough just enough juice just enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.620" end="01:03:27.090" style="s2">shape that people can kind of come and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.100" end="01:03:29.940" style="s2">tend it or you know find it you know to</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.090" end="01:03:32.340" style="s2">actually grow it from that point to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.940" end="01:03:33.840" style="s2">the question for everyone in that like</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.340" end="01:03:35.490" style="s2">sometimes this is like wait does not not</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.840" end="01:03:37.800" style="s2">everyone feel this way like if you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.490" end="01:03:40.470" style="s2">putting your time into practice is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.800" end="01:03:42.180" style="s2">what the Maori Factory I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.470" end="01:03:43.500" style="s2">Janelle has has her version and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.180" end="01:03:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a few people who have their</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.500" end="01:03:47.430" style="s2">version of like a platform right that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.210" end="01:03:49.110" style="s2">they want to want to do if you put all</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.430" end="01:03:51.000" style="s2">of your time and energy into that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.110" end="01:03:52.940" style="s2">then we never use it we use Janelle&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.000" end="01:03:55.410" style="s2">we never use Janelle&#39;s I may use yours</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.940" end="01:03:56.650" style="s2">what does that feel like to you because</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.410" end="01:03:59.410" style="s2">that&#39;s my issue my</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.650" end="01:04:01.540" style="s2">like the the inefficiency of that like</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.410" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">why can&#39;t we get together and decide on</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.540" end="01:04:06.190" style="s2">one thing and then support it right and</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:07.900" style="s2">like what are all the features but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.190" end="01:04:09.460" style="s2">I&#39;m the only one who feels that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.900" end="01:04:10.900" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s my role maybe other</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.460" end="01:04:12.550" style="s2">people are like no I&#39;m good I really</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.900" end="01:04:14.530" style="s2">enjoy making this even if nothing ever</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.550" end="01:04:16.120" style="s2">happens which is how I feel but</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.530" end="01:04:17.650" style="s2">creatively global cooperative without</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.120" end="01:04:20.230" style="s2">feeling that completely because I really</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.650" end="01:04:22.210" style="s2">wanted because I can see the vision but</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.230" end="01:04:24.340" style="s2">even if it doesn&#39;t become something I</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.210" end="01:04:28.530" style="s2">enjoy creating it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.340" end="01:04:31.870" style="s2">is it like that for you um yes and no I</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.530" end="01:04:34.930" style="s2">actually set the set the technology out</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.870" end="01:04:37.930" style="s2">and then I edited a really long book so</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.930" end="01:04:41.320" style="s2">I basically did nothing on it myself for</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.930" end="01:04:42.520" style="s2">for a very long time but I think you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.320" end="01:04:43.780" style="s2">know the different ones the difference</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.520" end="01:04:46.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a look at Janelle&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.780" end="01:04:48.670" style="s2">instance and hers seems to be a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.510" end="01:04:50.770" style="s2">about about the conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.670" end="01:04:54.130" style="s2">sharing and you know serve around gain</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.770" end="01:04:56.020" style="s2">be in particular when I look at France</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.130" end="01:04:57.550" style="s2">or am I kind of go I would like to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.020" end="01:04:59.080" style="s2">your project on there and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.550" end="01:05:01.240" style="s2">see Janelle&#39;s project on there and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.080" end="01:05:04.120" style="s2">like to see you know whatever you guys</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.240" end="01:05:05.410" style="s2">are doing on there so you know it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.120" end="01:05:08.590" style="s2">one of those things that sort of meant</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.410" end="01:05:12.940" style="s2">to be a hub for people to work on their</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.590" end="01:05:15.130" style="s2">own projects it&#39;s just a space yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.940" end="01:05:18.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just a space it&#39;s just an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.130" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">that you know eventually I would hope</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.130" end="01:05:24.040" style="s2">that it could also attract you know you</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:25.720" style="s2">know philanthropists into and so on to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.040" end="01:05:27.640" style="s2">actually focus on you know whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.720" end="01:05:30.490" style="s2">wicked problems people are interested in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.640" end="01:05:33.220" style="s2">looking at so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s only meant</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.490" end="01:05:35.560" style="s2">to be a you know a way of pulling things</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.220" end="01:05:39.370" style="s2">together quite literally that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.560" end="01:05:41.350" style="s2">all I have a question like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.370" end="01:05:43.330" style="s2">more like a joint could it be that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.350" end="01:05:46.270" style="s2">only people who would actually grab the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.330" end="01:05:47.770" style="s2">game be who would would be those people</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.270" end="01:05:49.780" style="s2">who already have their own idea and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.770" end="01:05:51.700" style="s2">their own drive to come and then just</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.780" end="01:05:53.410" style="s2">like hey who wants to join me like</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.700" end="01:05:55.660" style="s2">nobody in the general populace is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.410" end="01:05:59.110" style="s2">interested but you are you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.660" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">the same things and join me and they are</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.110" end="01:06:08.080" style="s2">it yeah yeah join us I want to be able</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:09.010" style="s2">to get together and have the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.080" end="01:06:10.930" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.010" end="01:06:12.970" style="s2">if we have our own projects which we do</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.930" end="01:06:15.820" style="s2">and we&#39;re passionate about them what</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.970" end="01:06:17.380" style="s2">kind of project could benefit those</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.820" end="01:06:19.480" style="s2">projects right like what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.380" end="01:06:21.070" style="s2">platform isn&#39;t Kiley&#39;s or Janelle&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.480" end="01:06:24.820" style="s2">like what brings all of that together</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.070" end="01:06:27.070" style="s2">that isn&#39;t general owns it or Kiley owns</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.820" end="01:06:28.840" style="s2">it or it does 60 percent here in 60</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.070" end="01:06:31.060" style="s2">percent there that&#39;s what already exists</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.840" end="01:06:33.580" style="s2">right at Google - this app - this thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.060" end="01:06:34.690" style="s2">and you have the system but you have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.580" end="01:06:36.550" style="s2">pay for some of them and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.690" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">interconnect and they don&#39;t like how do</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.550" end="01:06:41.290" style="s2">we come together and create the thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.970" style="s2">when partly we don&#39;t want to we want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.290" end="01:06:44.650" style="s2">have our project right like we want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.970" end="01:06:45.820" style="s2">have like you want yours to look your</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.650" end="01:06:48.310" style="s2">way and then other people that come on</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.820" end="01:06:49.990" style="s2">board and use it when truthfully we</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.310" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">would be if you brought that to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.990" end="01:06:55.330" style="s2">table and whatever new entity we had was</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:57.880" style="s2">created that had you know 90% of your</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.330" end="01:06:59.830" style="s2">tool and 90% of genell&#39;s that made made</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.880" end="01:07:02.230" style="s2">the more important piece which is it</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.830" end="01:07:03.730" style="s2">meant 90 percent of my needs right 90%</p>

<p begin="01:07:05.380" end="01:07:09.369" style="s2">projects like that is the piece to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.200" end="01:07:10.900" style="s2">that comes from bringing something</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.369" end="01:07:12.940" style="s2">together and creating something from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.900" end="01:07:18.310" style="s2">ground up that isn&#39;t the individual</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.940" end="01:07:20.109" style="s2">pieces well we&#39;re all using Facebook for</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.310" end="01:07:22.390" style="s2">example right so somebody just created</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.109" end="01:07:25.030" style="s2">and many people just joined eventually</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.390" end="01:07:32.230" style="s2">so in principle it is possible to join</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.030" end="01:07:35.170" style="s2">something right so maybe because it just</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.230" end="01:07:37.990" style="s2">was easy enough to join so maybe part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.170" end="01:07:40.090" style="s2">the question is that yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.990" end="01:07:41.800" style="s2">of hard enough to join in everywhere and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.090" end="01:07:44.650" style="s2">you need to still make a decision and</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.800" end="01:07:46.810" style="s2">you&#39;re just gravitating towards where</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.650" end="01:07:51.090" style="s2">the most people are already where the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.810" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">the resources are and the kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.090" end="01:07:58.590" style="s2">Perito effects that just the one who is</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:08:01.930" style="s2">most popular at that moment kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.590" end="01:08:03.869" style="s2">dominates and and and and this is more</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.930" end="01:08:06.220" style="s2">much more not just people but just</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.869" end="01:08:08.590" style="s2">existence in general that there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.220" end="01:08:10.780" style="s2">things that we just need to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.590" end="01:08:12.760" style="s2">that there will be a lot of small</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.780" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">attempts many people trying out and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.760" end="01:08:17.429" style="s2">somebody wins out and</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:20.790" style="s2">just part of the deal of being alive</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.429" end="01:08:23.400" style="s2">could that be but I think like for me</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.790" end="01:08:24.929" style="s2">Facebook exists it exists because it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.400" end="01:08:26.279" style="s2">new to the market it was something that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.929" end="01:08:27.810" style="s2">nothing else now there&#39;s Instagram</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.279" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">Twitter nothing is gonna be Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.810" end="01:08:32.639" style="s2">they come in and out compete Facebook is</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:34.020" style="s2">next to zero so like Kylie is project</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.639" end="01:08:35.310" style="s2">Pinellas project isn&#39;t like I&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.020" end="01:08:37.949" style="s2">think that&#39;s in your goal to out-compete</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.310" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">Facebook coming together and creating</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.949" end="01:08:42.299" style="s2">something that was for a million of us</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:43.500" style="s2">what Facebook is would out-compete</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.299" end="01:08:44.909" style="s2">Facebook at least for that million</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.500" end="01:08:46.279" style="s2">people and if you have that threshold</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.909" end="01:08:49.380" style="s2">that&#39;s easy to bring in other people</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.279" end="01:08:50.639" style="s2">there&#39;s that a tractor that naturally</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.380" end="01:08:52.350" style="s2">emerges that when there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.639" end="01:08:53.940" style="s2">something in the marketplace it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.350" end="01:08:56.449" style="s2">going to bring people in in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.940" end="01:08:59.130" style="s2">that like Facebook did like I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.449" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">one of our individual projects out</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.130" end="01:09:04.409" style="s2">competing facebooking game a in the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:05.850" style="s2">way our project could write like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.409" end="01:09:07.830" style="s2">a difference where it&#39;s like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.850" end="01:09:10.679" style="s2">meet 90% of 90% of the people&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.830" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">instead of a tiny group of people it may</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.679" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">be 90% of their needs right those like</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.469" end="01:09:19.620" style="s2">otherwise I&#39;m okay with waiting for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.790" end="01:09:21.449" style="s2">gem to start and then we can all get on</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.620" end="01:09:22.650" style="s2">board but it doesn&#39;t like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.449" end="01:09:24.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening it seems to be just</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.650" end="01:09:26.460" style="s2">dissipating all of the energy that like</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.690" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these places to put your</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.460" end="01:09:30.839" style="s2">project and all these places to find</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:32.520" style="s2">people that even the game B space is</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.839" end="01:09:35.159" style="s2">kind of dissipated between like Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.520" end="01:09:36.630" style="s2">and discord and the Facebook like I</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.159" end="01:09:39.000" style="s2">don&#39;t care about Twitter even though on</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.630" end="01:09:42.509" style="s2">it I don&#39;t get game B on Twitter I get</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.000" end="01:09:44.759" style="s2">game B on Facebook so there&#39;s well game</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.509" end="01:09:46.589" style="s2">B is a lot about decentralization right</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.759" end="01:09:49.020" style="s2">and the way that if I see it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.589" end="01:09:53.580" style="s2">collective intelligence emerging through</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.020" end="01:09:55.650" style="s2">what looks like very you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.580" end="01:09:58.020" style="s2">emerging and from all of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.650" end="01:10:00.260" style="s2">individual projects and individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.020" end="01:10:02.940" style="s2">spaces so I see it as very decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.260" end="01:10:04.920" style="s2">you know the stuff that I&#39;m learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.940" end="01:10:07.219" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want to centralize it you</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.920" end="01:10:10.139" style="s2">know it for me if they don&#39;t go together</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.219" end="01:10:11.909" style="s2">so a lot of the stuff that I&#39;m learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.139" end="01:10:15.000" style="s2">and bringing home I&#39;m implementing in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.909" end="01:10:17.219" style="s2">community here and that&#39;s where you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.000" end="01:10:19.139" style="s2">I&#39;m encountering the real challenges</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.219" end="01:10:22.739" style="s2">that come with co-creating like</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.139" end="01:10:24.929" style="s2">physically and I&#39;m more attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.739" end="01:10:27.420" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a lot of work there</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.929" end="01:10:28.890" style="s2">there&#39;s like a lot of work to just on</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.420" end="01:10:30.780" style="s2">that level</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.890" end="01:10:32.670" style="s2">and then that&#39;s when I see you know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.780" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t working and what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.670" end="01:10:36.390" style="s2">know and it&#39;s a very slow process like</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:38.550" style="s2">just coming into like the talking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.390" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">the Dunbar number trying to come into</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.550" end="01:10:42.450" style="s2">coherency with the people in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:44.790" style="s2">immediate community it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.450" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">challenging right and and so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.790" end="01:10:49.530" style="s2">freeing these tools slowly back in</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.910" style="s2">enhancing my own personal life and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.530" end="01:10:52.230" style="s2">Michael here and see with the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.910" end="01:10:54.840" style="s2">around me and then trying to do little</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.230" end="01:10:58.440" style="s2">projects with the people around me as I</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.840" end="01:11:01.260" style="s2">work on my own individual projects you</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.440" end="01:11:03.000" style="s2">know that I&#39;m building on and and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.260" end="01:11:04.380" style="s2">seeing what comes up and I&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.000" end="01:11:06.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a whole bunch of amazing</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.380" end="01:11:09.000" style="s2">things there&#39;s a lot of gratification</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.030" end="01:11:10.950" style="s2">and supplement that comes from building</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.000" end="01:11:13.200" style="s2">you know an ecological village like I</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.950" end="01:11:15.150" style="s2">went through that whole thing with</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.200" end="01:11:17.100" style="s2">someone ten years ago or a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.150" end="01:11:19.290" style="s2">longer doc and and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.100" end="01:11:21.630" style="s2">gratification in that but you know you</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.290" end="01:11:24.210" style="s2">have to it&#39;s like where is the energy in</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.630" end="01:11:27.060" style="s2">motion right now for me you know because</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.210" end="01:11:28.380" style="s2">a lot of it is out of our control and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.060" end="01:11:30.360" style="s2">it&#39;s what comes to us is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.380" end="01:11:33.540" style="s2">opportunities and what&#39;s presenting and</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.360" end="01:11:35.580" style="s2">then that&#39;s the next step so I see your</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.540" end="01:11:38.190" style="s2">vision and then it&#39;s to see where the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.580" end="01:11:39.750" style="s2">energy is gonna go with it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.190" end="01:11:41.640" style="s2">but for me personally it&#39;s a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.750" end="01:11:44.850" style="s2">just implementing into my very immediate</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.640" end="01:11:54.030" style="s2">life and the immediate community needs</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.850" end="01:11:55.890" style="s2">be game be models and teachings which i</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.030" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">think is great when you&#39;re able to find</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.890" end="01:11:59.790" style="s2">those physical projects and people in</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:02.490" style="s2">the real world to do those things with</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.790" end="01:12:03.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not that easy for many people</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.490" end="01:12:05.640" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for me than it is for a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.720" end="01:12:08.040" style="s2">of people but like I can&#39;t leave my</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.640" end="01:12:10.770" style="s2">house most of the time so like online is</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.040" end="01:12:12.930" style="s2">my community which is fine but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.770" end="01:12:14.250" style="s2">not very many physical projects I can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.930" end="01:12:17.940" style="s2">part of but I can be part of it online</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.250" end="01:12:20.370" style="s2">one right like I can um and for me the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.940" end="01:12:23.160" style="s2">reason I want not centralization but</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.370" end="01:12:25.980" style="s2">like collectivism of like like that when</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.160" end="01:12:27.810" style="s2">you learn what went wrong in your eco</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.980" end="01:12:28.860" style="s2">village that the rest of us can learn</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.810" end="01:12:30.510" style="s2">from that as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.860" end="01:12:32.220" style="s2">that you know and I mean that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.510" end="01:12:33.810" style="s2">like one pool of knowledge you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.220" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">choose whether you contribute to it you</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.810" end="01:12:36.990" style="s2">can choose whether or not you learn from</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:39.000" style="s2">it but like for all of us to have these</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.990" end="01:12:40.380" style="s2">individual experiments which I have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.000" end="01:12:42.179" style="s2">learn everything on my own</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.380" end="01:12:45.239" style="s2">really bad at learning things for my own</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.179" end="01:12:47.400" style="s2">like I want that centralized or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.239" end="01:12:48.870" style="s2">it&#39;s called foundation of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.400" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">where I can be like oh who else has</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.870" end="01:12:52.469" style="s2">started eco-village jessica cool i want</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:55.469" style="s2">to talk to her right so I can learn the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.469" end="01:12:56.850" style="s2">pitfalls or watch your video diary which</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.469" end="01:12:59.310" style="s2">is ten minutes at the end of you being</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.850" end="01:13:01.739" style="s2">like this is why I didn&#39;t work out right</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.310" end="01:13:05.909" style="s2">like whatever makes it simple to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.739" end="01:13:07.020" style="s2">to grow and to decentralize something</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.909" end="01:13:09.510" style="s2">just so that we can say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.020" end="01:13:11.429" style="s2">decentralized as opposed to wait what is</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.510" end="01:13:13.590" style="s2">the good part of centralization without</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.429" end="01:13:15.389" style="s2">giving up our sovereign power and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.590" end="01:13:18.030" style="s2">are the pit like creating something</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.389" end="01:13:19.409" style="s2">that&#39;s a solution instead of needing it</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.030" end="01:13:23.070" style="s2">to be decentralized if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.409" end="01:13:25.380" style="s2">like what would get us all into</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.070" end="01:13:27.330" style="s2">ecovillages faster or would get us all</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.380" end="01:13:28.860" style="s2">into our projects right so that if one</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.330" end="01:13:30.060" style="s2">falls apart we can find the other one</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.860" end="01:13:33.540" style="s2">even if we don&#39;t have the personal</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.060" end="01:13:35.159" style="s2">skills and perhaps Gabey isn&#39;t the place</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.540" end="01:13:37.560" style="s2">like perhaps that because I do you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.159" end="01:13:40.350" style="s2">online you have an irate like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.560" end="01:13:42.389" style="s2">just so much online right so if you need</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.350" end="01:13:46.199" style="s2">something and it&#39;s there like to me</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.389" end="01:13:49.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the global village so maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.199" end="01:13:50.940" style="s2">know he and he isn&#39;t this space or what</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.050" end="01:13:52.770" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for like you know and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.940" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">just as like it that could be a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.770" end="01:13:59.040" style="s2">possibility yeah there is another space</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.870" style="s2">that is that would there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.040" end="01:14:04.020" style="s2">looking to work on that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.870" end="01:14:07.920" style="s2">just not sure I&#39;m just not sure where</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.020" end="01:14:10.980" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna fit in its for you did</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.920" end="01:14:13.080" style="s2">it like does are you what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.980" end="01:14:15.210" style="s2">okay with it&#39;s the wrong word but like</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.080" end="01:14:16.980" style="s2">when I said like for you to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.210" end="01:14:18.330" style="s2">teach like there&#39;s a collective pool of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.980" end="01:14:20.280" style="s2">information that you when you start an</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.330" end="01:14:21.420" style="s2">eco village you can go through what</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.280" end="01:14:23.670" style="s2">other people have gone through and</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.420" end="01:14:25.920" style="s2">learned you know Naveen is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.670" end="01:14:27.210" style="s2">not appeal to people like there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.920" end="01:14:28.260" style="s2">piece of like maybe I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.210" end="01:14:29.610" style="s2">organize something that doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.260" end="01:14:31.290" style="s2">be organized because they chaoticness</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.610" end="01:14:32.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re hoping something emerges from</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.290" end="01:14:35.690" style="s2">for me as too chaotic like I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.940" end="01:14:38.760" style="s2">just want to organize it I want to like</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.690" end="01:14:40.770" style="s2">learn from what came before and find</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.760" end="01:14:46.860" style="s2">little I don&#39;t know like data points and</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.770" end="01:14:48.480" style="s2">such and look Jim exactly that was</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.860" end="01:14:51.210" style="s2">exactly what I was thinking when I set</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.480" end="01:14:51.659" style="s2">up for iam what what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.210" end="01:14:54.460" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.659" end="01:14:56.320" style="s2">absolutely exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.460" end="01:14:58.810" style="s2">I think that there is a need for it of</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.320" end="01:15:01.110" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve had feedback from quite a</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.810" end="01:15:03.070" style="s2">few people that there is a name for it</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.110" end="01:15:05.680" style="s2">unfortunately the people that I choose</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.070" end="01:15:06.940" style="s2">the ones that are you know or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.680" end="01:15:08.260" style="s2">seem to be attracted to the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.940" end="01:15:13.300" style="s2">you know like end up having a newborn</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.260" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">baby or just like that so yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.300" end="01:15:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not there at the moment but I do</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:18.430" style="s2">actually very much think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.720" end="01:15:21.550" style="s2">need for what you&#39;re what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.430" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">about and that in some ways the model is</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.550" end="01:15:28.030" style="s2">like Wikipedia but its Wikipedia that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:32.290" style="s2">got more of a focus on things that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.030" end="01:15:34.720" style="s2">happening rather than on history so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.290" end="01:15:37.720" style="s2">know like yeah pulling you know like</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.720" end="01:15:41.260" style="s2">past information in to be able to use it</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.720" end="01:15:44.110" style="s2">but but not so much just focused on</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.260" end="01:15:47.800" style="s2">being encyclopedia rather you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.110" end="01:15:50.590" style="s2">directory and a filter for people so</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.800" end="01:15:52.210" style="s2">yeah yeah like I guess what gave me back</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.590" end="01:15:55.000" style="s2">to the actual conversation we were happy</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.210" end="01:15:56.530" style="s2">like that idea that complexity stops the</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.000" end="01:15:58.120" style="s2">Dunbar number right that like we only</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.530" end="01:15:59.980" style="s2">have so much complexity in our head and</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.120" end="01:16:03.610" style="s2">what&#39;s left is what we&#39;re able to fill</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.980" end="01:16:06.730" style="s2">with relationships it&#39;s like to me we</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.610" end="01:16:08.800" style="s2">can deal with complexity like we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.730" end="01:16:10.600" style="s2">make knowledge more accessible in a way</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.800" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">right where you don&#39;t need to start from</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.600" end="01:16:14.740" style="s2">Ground Zero when you start an eco</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:16.860" style="s2">village that there&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.740" end="01:16:19.810" style="s2">propositional and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.860" end="01:16:21.130" style="s2">the propositional knowing we can do for</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.810" end="01:16:23.230" style="s2">each other and with each other the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.130" end="01:16:25.060" style="s2">participatory no II know I can&#39;t sit</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.230" end="01:16:26.560" style="s2">meditate for you I can&#39;t actually give</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.060" end="01:16:28.210" style="s2">you the skills of you what worker I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.590" style="s2">teach you but you&#39;ve the 30 years of</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.210" end="01:16:33.130" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve had I can&#39;t pass on</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.590" end="01:16:35.140" style="s2">right like there&#39;s tools we can use that</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.130" end="01:16:36.670" style="s2">makes sense to be centralized and tools</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.140" end="01:16:38.710" style="s2">that like are like wait you need a</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.670" end="01:16:40.270" style="s2">personal if you&#39;re not gonna meditate</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.710" end="01:16:42.040" style="s2">what are you gonna do if you&#39;re how do</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.270" end="01:16:43.630" style="s2">you deal with your anger here&#39;s 15 tools</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.040" end="01:16:45.460" style="s2">that you can choose one of instead of</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.630" end="01:16:47.650" style="s2">just need to find what exists out there</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.460" end="01:16:51.100" style="s2">which always feels a little too chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.650" end="01:16:53.110" style="s2">for me like I want to know who found</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.100" end="01:16:54.360" style="s2">what helpful and want the Yelp review</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.110" end="01:16:57.730" style="s2">for everything that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.360" end="01:16:59.470" style="s2">trustworthy and not yell bones it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.730" end="01:17:01.240" style="s2">it&#39;s one two five star instead of like</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.470" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">no does it work for my learning style</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.240" end="01:17:05.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work with the problem I have</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:07.309" style="s2">right like I just wanted to be more</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.710" end="01:17:09.849" style="s2">organized yes so</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.309" end="01:17:12.349" style="s2">efficiency and effectiveness in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.849" end="01:17:16.429" style="s2">part of that because you see the</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.349" end="01:17:18.260" style="s2">potential anyone to texturized I guess</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.429" end="01:17:20.300" style="s2">if it would be like 200 years ago you</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.260" end="01:17:22.429" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even have the expectation that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.300" end="01:17:25.480" style="s2">it is possible but now it seems like it</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.429" end="01:17:28.130" style="s2">is within reach and therefore the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.480" end="01:17:31.280" style="s2">enthusiasm and then also the desperation</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.130" end="01:17:35.630" style="s2">when there&#39;s not not not happening sorry</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.280" end="01:17:37.820" style="s2">I was what is the world has gotten so</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.630" end="01:17:39.800" style="s2">complex for me and after my brain damage</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.820" end="01:17:41.150" style="s2">I can see how complex it is and how much</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.800" end="01:17:42.650" style="s2">I want to have access to the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.150" end="01:17:43.880" style="s2">information I used to be able to put in</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.650" end="01:17:47.300" style="s2">my head and I want it and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.880" end="01:17:48.980" style="s2">external source so that I have the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.300" end="01:17:51.139" style="s2">energy left over to have actual</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.980" end="01:17:54.260" style="s2">relationships to have the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.139" end="01:17:55.940" style="s2">to have that right like like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.260" end="01:17:57.679" style="s2">have to him think about all that</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.940" end="01:17:59.239" style="s2"> right like who cares about the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.679" end="01:18:00.860" style="s2">economics and politics and stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.239" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">I&#39;m constantly focused on because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.860" end="01:18:06.710" style="s2">world&#39;s collapsing my personal one and</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:08.300" style="s2">you know what I mean like what I want is</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.710" end="01:18:10.280" style="s2">the actual connection and community but</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.300" end="01:18:12.230" style="s2">I like how do you do that when world</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.280" end="01:18:13.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work right like when I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.230" end="01:18:14.809" style="s2">figure out what to eat because the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.460" end="01:18:17.449" style="s2">executive function doesn&#39;t work because</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.809" end="01:18:19.460" style="s2">I&#39;m expected to you know answer emails</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.449" end="01:18:22.429" style="s2">in 30 seconds like all of it is too</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.460" end="01:18:24.619" style="s2">complex that like if we can solve some</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.429" end="01:18:26.719" style="s2">of that complexity and end for each</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.619" end="01:18:29.150" style="s2">other then there&#39;s more room left for</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.719" end="01:18:31.130" style="s2">what is meaningful which is like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.150" end="01:18:35.900" style="s2">relationships and the and the personal</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.130" end="01:18:38.570" style="s2">work maybe it would be still important</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.900" end="01:18:43.630" style="s2">to recognize why it is so complex and my</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.570" end="01:18:46.329" style="s2">guess is that well as referring before</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.630" end="01:18:49.130" style="s2">well complexity involving many</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.329" end="01:18:51.469" style="s2">interacting parts right and each of them</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.130" end="01:18:53.150" style="s2">generating information and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.469" end="01:18:55.340" style="s2">information coming in through the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.150" end="01:18:57.260" style="s2">channels and when there&#39;s too much we</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.340" end="01:19:00.949" style="s2">get into the chaos because it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.260" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">longer feasible to deal with it so why</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.949" end="01:19:06.829" style="s2">is there more change well partially</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:09.230" style="s2">because the world is more global that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.829" end="01:19:12.110" style="s2">means more connected right if when we</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.230" end="01:19:13.869" style="s2">were living locally then there was</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.120" end="01:19:47.800" style="s2">getting into this and kind of inevitable</p>

<p begin="01:19:59.949" end="01:20:03.460" style="s2">those options and considering them and</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.460" end="01:20:07.719" style="s2">have participated in each day in</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.320" end="01:20:11.110" style="s2">something now three weeks past and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.719" end="01:20:13.690" style="s2">still don&#39;t want to go it&#39;s like if we</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.110" end="01:20:15.160" style="s2">were not involved we did not evolve to</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.690" end="01:20:17.080" style="s2">deal with that kind of amount of</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.160" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">information and yet we&#39;re still trying</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.080" end="01:20:22.600" style="s2">to connect so maybe we&#39;ve done enough</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.840" end="01:20:25.030" style="s2">connecting now it&#39;s not just you need to</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.600" end="01:20:26.860" style="s2">start setting the boundaries and be very</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.030" end="01:20:28.900" style="s2">selective maybe that would also split</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.860" end="01:20:31.780" style="s2">down some of the things going on at</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.900" end="01:20:34.989" style="s2">least I would like to have fewer people</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.780" end="01:20:37.570" style="s2">read watching TV reading useless stuff</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.989" end="01:20:41.230" style="s2">on online and like those things are</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.570" end="01:20:43.960" style="s2">there and they&#39;re taking a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.230" end="01:20:48.699" style="s2">and attention including the kitten</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.960" end="01:20:52.210" style="s2">videos which are always so attractive so</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.699" end="01:20:54.370" style="s2">somehow learning to say a lot of no no</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.210" end="01:20:57.130" style="s2">no no maybe we&#39;ll get back to the place</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.370" end="01:20:58.780" style="s2">where they it&#39;s best complex obviously</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.130" end="01:21:00.910" style="s2">we will get less of information but</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.780" end="01:21:04.330" style="s2">maybe those who are still trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.910" end="01:21:06.310" style="s2">to us advertising other active people</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.330" end="01:21:08.890" style="s2">everything maybe they will develop new</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.310" end="01:21:12.010" style="s2">strategies how to reach us while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.890" end="01:21:14.050" style="s2">very kind of you know well we went out</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.010" end="01:21:17.020" style="s2">of Facebook so maybe we need to start</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.050" end="01:21:19.150" style="s2">going away rather than seeking all of</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.020" end="01:21:21.040" style="s2">that you know I need to be connected on</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.150" end="01:21:23.290" style="s2">Facebook on Twitter on YouTube or</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.040" end="01:21:28.170" style="s2">whatever just start saying no maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.290" end="01:21:31.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the solution for for you know for</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.170" end="01:21:35.500" style="s2">kind of giving a spur for the system</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.550" end="01:21:39.410" style="s2">to improve and and rather than just</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.500" end="01:21:42.950" style="s2">using our kind of a more base psychology</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.410" end="01:21:44.930" style="s2">and using sex and colorful things and</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.950" end="01:21:47.780" style="s2">quickly changing things in the clips to</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.930" end="01:21:49.400" style="s2">attract our attention we&#39;ll have to come</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.780" end="01:21:51.410" style="s2">up with something more genuine more</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.400" end="01:21:53.420" style="s2">meaningful and only then we will pay</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.410" end="01:21:56.060" style="s2">attention so we need to be like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.420" end="01:21:58.220" style="s2">more disgusted by oh it this ad is</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.060" end="01:22:00.170" style="s2">trying to take away my attention from</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.220" end="01:22:02.120" style="s2">something important I will not buy that</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.170" end="01:22:06.530" style="s2">I will just block it or whatever maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.120" end="01:22:09.800" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the solution thank you I</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.530" end="01:22:13.010" style="s2">went through that and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.800" end="01:22:14.930" style="s2">how I found it always going going</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.010" end="01:22:17.420" style="s2">through the wringer with the algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.930" end="01:22:19.670" style="s2">and with my intention being hijacked on</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.420" end="01:22:22.550" style="s2">all sorts of things and it takes away</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.670" end="01:22:24.590" style="s2">from presents being present in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.550" end="01:22:28.220" style="s2">moment and that&#39;s where things are</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.590" end="01:22:30.830" style="s2">created from right as that that embodied</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.220" end="01:22:32.320" style="s2">presents and then just having our</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.830" end="01:22:35.000" style="s2">attention all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.320" end="01:22:37.520" style="s2">so going back to Daniel schnecken</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.000" end="01:22:39.950" style="s2">burgers the way he describes the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.520" end="01:22:44.330" style="s2">sovereignty and agency and now how they</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.950" end="01:22:49.760" style="s2">come into being in symmetry with forests</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.330" end="01:22:51.650" style="s2">on trees idea of principles and and how</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.760" end="01:22:53.870" style="s2">how they&#39;re developed and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.650" end="01:22:56.990" style="s2">this dance with self and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.870" end="01:22:58.760" style="s2">understanding the boundaries to increase</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.990" end="01:23:00.920" style="s2">the sovereignty to increase the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.760" end="01:23:02.810" style="s2">well-being like to meet all of your</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.920" end="01:23:05.630" style="s2">needs and sometimes you have to retract</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.810" end="01:23:09.500" style="s2">and really come back into the space of</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.630" end="01:23:12.290" style="s2">here and now and do these minute little</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.500" end="01:23:16.790" style="s2">things to increase that sovereignty to</p>

<p begin="01:23:20.200" end="01:23:25.850" style="s2">to you know be in that space and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.480" end="01:23:27.560" style="s2">slowly that increases the agency it</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.850" end="01:23:30.350" style="s2">reflects the agent you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.560" end="01:23:32.270" style="s2">agency in the outside world so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.350" end="01:23:34.300" style="s2">this dance and sort of that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.270" end="01:23:38.060" style="s2">projects are created and come into being</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.300" end="01:23:41.210" style="s2">is honoring what is honoring like where</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.060" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">your energy needs to be and then it will</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.210" end="01:23:44.959" style="s2">slowly increase your agency increase</p>

<p begin="01:23:44.959" end="01:23:49.219" style="s2">to birth for these projects so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.959" end="01:23:51.050" style="s2">sort of playing with that and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.219" end="01:23:53.179" style="s2">I have to go all the way back it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.050" end="01:23:55.189" style="s2">well I haven&#39;t been sleeping well for</p>

<p begin="01:24:03.050" end="01:24:06.949" style="s2">or distracting myself with other things</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.880" end="01:24:09.679" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m not able to come into</p>

<p begin="01:26:02.990" end="01:26:07.520" style="s2">many times you go to doctors and tried</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.280" end="01:26:09.380" style="s2">everything I think this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.520" end="01:26:12.080" style="s2">where we can get to a lot of sadness</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.380" end="01:26:15.050" style="s2">stuff because there will be some moments</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.080" end="01:26:17.990" style="s2">where we&#39;ll realize that some some needs</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.050" end="01:26:20.090" style="s2">not necessarily ours cannot be met it at</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.990" end="01:26:22.310" style="s2">that moment and it might be even</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.090" end="01:26:24.110" style="s2">difficult to go to that topic but I</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.310" end="01:26:26.600" style="s2">still I think it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.110" end="01:26:28.130" style="s2">name it because just like with let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.600" end="01:26:30.380" style="s2">if there&#39;s a disease that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.130" end="01:26:32.240" style="s2">cure for and yet we might say oh</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.380" end="01:26:34.190" style="s2">everybody needs to pull in their</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.240" end="01:26:36.110" style="s2">resources and look for it but there</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.190" end="01:26:38.690" style="s2">might not be enough time and we might</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.110" end="01:26:41.450" style="s2">not find out that or if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.690" end="01:26:43.250" style="s2">hurricane or an earthquake and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.450" end="01:26:45.500" style="s2">people die in the same sense we could</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.250" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">say that other people are this force</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.500" end="01:26:51.830" style="s2">majeure sometimes to us either through</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:56.180" style="s2">war or through you know regular crime</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.830" end="01:26:58.010" style="s2">like and and then and then even shelter</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.180" end="01:27:01.730" style="s2">and other things it&#39;s just a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.010" end="01:27:06.890" style="s2">people saying no we will not give this</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.730" end="01:27:10.280" style="s2">to you because there&#39;s no like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.890" end="01:27:12.530" style="s2">not enough resources to do that from</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.280" end="01:27:14.180" style="s2">their perspective they&#39;re focusing their</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.530" end="01:27:16.790" style="s2">attention and other resources elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.180" end="01:27:21.020" style="s2">and so somebody dies out of starvation</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.790" end="01:27:24.970" style="s2">some places right eventually so we have</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.020" end="01:27:29.450" style="s2">this happening both on the kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.970" end="01:27:32.240" style="s2">level off of humans of animals and I any</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.450" end="01:27:35.600" style="s2">material material what&#39;s the right word</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.240" end="01:27:39.410" style="s2">like just nature general nature just</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.600" end="01:27:41.180" style="s2">killing us right and it is very sad but</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.410" end="01:27:43.670" style="s2">sometimes that happens that the only</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.180" end="01:27:49.670" style="s2">answer that I&#39;m getting is that no you</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.670" end="01:27:52.040" style="s2">will not receive this and some people</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.670" end="01:27:53.690" style="s2">will not get what they want and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.040" end="01:27:55.730" style="s2">saying that just like well let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.690" end="01:27:59.750" style="s2">not take responsibility for that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.730" end="01:28:01.400" style="s2">saying that I think it&#39;s still part of</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.750" end="01:28:02.690" style="s2">the real I&#39;ll the reality that it</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.400" end="01:28:05.000" style="s2">happens sometimes and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.690" end="01:28:08.030" style="s2">important to identify when it when that</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.000" end="01:28:09.980" style="s2">is the case maybe it&#39;s temporary but</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.030" end="01:28:12.560" style="s2">right now maybe there&#39;s nobody around</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.980" end="01:28:14.420" style="s2">who cares enough to you know know good</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.560" end="01:28:18.410" style="s2">Nathan&#39;s around to pick me up and bring</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.420" end="01:28:20.750" style="s2">me to that place and and yes maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.410" end="01:28:23.690" style="s2">society even saying is no no we will not</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.750" end="01:28:25.490" style="s2">invest - you know saving these people</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.690" end="01:28:28.060" style="s2">who have like these ten people in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.490" end="01:28:31.010" style="s2">whole country who have this rare disease</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.060" end="01:28:33.350" style="s2">we are not considering that important</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.010" end="01:28:36.710" style="s2">enough I think that&#39;s also part of life</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.350" end="01:28:38.810" style="s2">recognizing that maybe this is the case</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.710" end="01:28:41.090" style="s2">so it&#39;s only like where do we draw the</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.810" end="01:28:43.040" style="s2">line are these still relevant and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.090" end="01:28:44.870" style="s2">going to invest and I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.040" end="01:28:46.640" style="s2">solution what to deal with what to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.870" end="01:28:48.740" style="s2">with that but I&#39;m just realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.640" end="01:28:52.520" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the game part of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.740" end="01:28:54.710" style="s2">situation that we are in and maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.520" end="01:28:57.050" style="s2">only after we are real we realized okay</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.710" end="01:28:58.340" style="s2">actually if we are not doing anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.050" end="01:29:00.920" style="s2">these people will die</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.340" end="01:29:02.300" style="s2">you know be it a war conflict only after</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.920" end="01:29:04.310" style="s2">we acknowledge it right now the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.300" end="01:29:06.920" style="s2">situation is like these things will</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.310" end="01:29:09.740" style="s2">happen these people the refugees gonna</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.920" end="01:29:12.470" style="s2">drown the you know in Holocaust these</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.740" end="01:29:15.140" style="s2">you know Jewish people and gypsy people</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.470" end="01:29:17.600" style="s2">and and you know anybody else they will</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.140" end="01:29:20.690" style="s2">get exterminated this will happen</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.600" end="01:29:22.700" style="s2">because right now the system says now we</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.690" end="01:29:24.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough resources only when we</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.700" end="01:29:27.110" style="s2">become so aware that maybe then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.680" end="01:29:29.900" style="s2">start shifting somewhere in looking for</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.110" end="01:29:32.210" style="s2">those resources we like if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.900" end="01:29:33.830" style="s2">meteor coming at us all right and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.210" end="01:29:34.910" style="s2">realize we don&#39;t have the technology to</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.830" end="01:29:39.470" style="s2">deal with it we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.910" end="01:29:41.720" style="s2">extinguished like this yeah gone and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.470" end="01:29:44.660" style="s2">would take like a decade to get enough</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.720" end="01:29:46.220" style="s2">of stuff so it might be very scary but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.660" end="01:29:49.310" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s part of that I</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.220" end="01:29:50.720" style="s2">think to recognize that maybe you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.310" end="01:29:52.850" style="s2">somebody not getting enough of something</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.720" end="01:29:55.040" style="s2">is actually actually we are observing</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.850" end="01:29:56.180" style="s2">then getting dying you know something</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.040" end="01:30:00.310" style="s2">like that I don&#39;t know where to go</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.180" end="01:30:00.310" style="s2">without but just that came out for me</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.340" end="01:30:05.630" style="s2">we just can&#39;t we can&#39;t change the group</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.040" end="01:30:10.340" style="s2">even if we reliance on the group or the</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.630" end="01:30:16.130" style="s2">circumstance I think that&#39;s a pull thank</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.340" end="01:30:19.280" style="s2">you where do I have sovereignty where</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.130" end="01:30:22.520" style="s2">are my choices in this moment where do I</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.280" end="01:30:26.110" style="s2">wear of my possibilities and always</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.520" end="01:30:29.080" style="s2">working from there because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.110" end="01:30:31.270" style="s2">limited so many ways on so many levels</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.080" end="01:30:33.369" style="s2">so it&#39;s like that&#39;s Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.270" end="01:30:35.380" style="s2">teach anything where can I take</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.369" end="01:30:36.250" style="s2">responsibility right now where do I have</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.380" end="01:30:44.469" style="s2">power right now</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.250" end="01:30:46.449" style="s2">I also have a tendency to think that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.469" end="01:30:56.290" style="s2">do have a lot more power socially than</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.449" end="01:30:58.570" style="s2">we think that we do you know what we</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.290" end="01:31:01.570" style="s2">think inside the box you know in terms</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.570" end="01:31:03.639" style="s2">of some of the politics it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.570" end="01:31:06.820" style="s2">you know we think politics is only being</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.639" end="01:31:13.810" style="s2">selection of a particular politician you</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.820" end="01:31:16.179" style="s2">know it&#39;s like we start taking an</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.810" end="01:31:19.469" style="s2">interest in civics to the point of doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.179" end="01:31:21.400" style="s2">okay well what is the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.469" end="01:31:23.800" style="s2">organizational structure that we should</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.400" end="01:31:26.409" style="s2">be using for achieving this particular</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.800" end="01:31:28.989" style="s2">goal you know should it be private</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.409" end="01:31:31.540" style="s2">should it be you know it&#39;s not it should</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.989" end="01:31:33.880" style="s2">it be managed by local or state or you</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.540" end="01:31:39.940" style="s2">know or federal should it something that</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.880" end="01:31:42.699" style="s2">is just you know like and opting you</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.940" end="01:31:44.440" style="s2">know community-led kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.699" end="01:31:46.719" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to think about we you</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.440" end="01:31:49.780" style="s2">know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t think about those</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.719" end="01:31:54.070" style="s2">things very much anymore and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.780" end="01:31:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s one of my one of my interests</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.070" end="01:31:59.920" style="s2">there I guess which is that yes like the</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.280" end="01:32:01.989" style="s2">personal sovereignty is important but I</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.920" end="01:32:05.380" style="s2">think that we&#39;ve also lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.989" end="01:32:08.100" style="s2">error a sovereignty in the greater world</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.380" end="01:32:12.699" style="s2">because we&#39;ll just defer that or</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.100" end="01:32:18.190" style="s2">delegated if you like to institutions</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.699" end="01:32:20.050" style="s2">that are no longer appropriate or only</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.190" end="01:32:24.940" style="s2">century and the technology that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.050" end="01:32:26.679" style="s2">living in yeah I think that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.940" end="01:32:32.260" style="s2">build it for sovereignty enough you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.679" end="01:32:34.690" style="s2">the enou safely I mean okay yes and no I</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.260" end="01:32:36.040" style="s2">think that is about so you know like</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.690" end="01:32:38.860" style="s2">building up your personal sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.040" end="01:32:39.730" style="s2">but then there&#39;s also the kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.860" end="01:32:41.290" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.730" end="01:32:44.140" style="s2">Julie was referring to before whether</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.290" end="01:32:47.800" style="s2">there are limitations that are placed on</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.140" end="01:32:48.970" style="s2">what we can do or actually not placed</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.800" end="01:32:51.400" style="s2">because it makes it sound like it is</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.970" end="01:32:53.830" style="s2">someone else is doing it but there are</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.400" end="01:32:56.790" style="s2">things that we actually have to do as</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.830" end="01:32:59.140" style="s2">groups you know that we&#39;ve got to one</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.790" end="01:33:01.000" style="s2">that we have to start from the group</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.140" end="01:33:03.040" style="s2">point you know you can&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.000" end="01:33:04.230" style="s2">everything as an individual you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.040" end="01:33:06.430" style="s2">some things</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.230" end="01:33:08.739" style="s2">there&#39;s too much impact on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.430" end="01:33:13.300" style="s2">individual for the individuals that have</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.739" end="01:33:14.830" style="s2">any power over it there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.300" end="01:33:16.630" style="s2">that we need to get together and deal</p>

<p begin="01:33:25.750" end="01:33:31.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like if some change needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.630" end="01:33:34.360" style="s2">made to the way that the medicine is</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.420" end="01:33:36.820" style="s2">done then one would hope that you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.360" end="01:33:40.060" style="s2">doctors and other health practitioners</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.820" end="01:33:41.650" style="s2">could find a way to get together and and</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.060" end="01:33:42.940" style="s2">make those changes they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.650" end="01:33:45.280" style="s2">be able to do it just individual in</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.940" end="01:33:47.440" style="s2">their own practices you know I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.280" end="01:33:49.300" style="s2">like yes the only Lincoln was there but</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.440" end="01:33:52.120" style="s2">they also need to coordinate in order to</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.300" end="01:33:58.630" style="s2">create you know a large enough force for</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.120" end="01:34:00.460" style="s2">change to move the ball along that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.630" end="01:34:03.880" style="s2">I appreciate you believe your energy is</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.460" end="01:34:07.570" style="s2">because there we need that push great</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.880" end="01:34:13.630" style="s2">got energy action and chaos in a group</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.570" end="01:34:16.080" style="s2">to stir that because usually in society</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.630" end="01:34:20.530" style="s2">we think things happen do for me think</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.080" end="01:34:25.120" style="s2">changes before it&#39;s the sister make</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.530" end="01:34:32.310" style="s2">those changes we rarely do it through</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.120" end="01:34:32.310" style="s2">foresight we get pushed into it</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.010" end="01:34:51.580" style="s2">but slightly I&#39;m saying both a and C it</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.270" end="01:34:53.910" style="s2">said yes we need to do individual and we</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.580" end="01:34:56.680" style="s2">need to group and we mean - if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.910" end="01:34:59.790" style="s2">always anything like because like this</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.680" end="01:34:59.790" style="s2">is nothing it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.380" end="01:35:08.410" style="s2">I just realized kind of a part of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.600" end="01:35:12.090" style="s2">problem maybe also is that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.410" end="01:35:14.770" style="s2">that we don&#39;t feel like joining in and</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.090" end="01:35:17.050" style="s2">creating some new tools I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.770" end="01:35:20.080" style="s2">also a lot of resistance and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.050" end="01:35:25.030" style="s2">clear why to use the already existing</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.080" end="01:35:26.980" style="s2">one good enough once that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.030" end="01:35:28.990" style="s2">could take any kind of psychology book</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.980" end="01:35:31.120" style="s2">and many people would benefit from it if</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.990" end="01:35:34.060" style="s2">they would just read it but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.120" end="01:35:36.640" style="s2">write and and there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.060" end="01:35:38.770" style="s2">an important one and there are you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.640" end="01:35:41.190" style="s2">there are like the same with rule Omega</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.770" end="01:35:43.510" style="s2">right many people would benefit but it</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.190" end="01:35:45.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t propagate yet for the whole world</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.510" end="01:35:47.980" style="s2">although everybody could just say - you</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.910" end="01:35:50.200" style="s2">know - people that they know hey this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.980" end="01:35:52.420" style="s2">a wonderful thing here I&#39;m explaining it</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.200" end="01:35:54.820" style="s2">to you and then you please pass it on</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.420" end="01:35:56.620" style="s2">and then it would grow exponentially and</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.820" end="01:35:59.170" style="s2">that we would have it written but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.620" end="01:36:01.620" style="s2">not happening I&#39;ve made that post about</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.170" end="01:36:04.300" style="s2">nonviolent communication there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.620" end="01:36:07.630" style="s2">other tools like internal family systems</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.300" end="01:36:09.400" style="s2">there&#39;s you know these are maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.630" end="01:36:10.990" style="s2">perfect but they&#39;re good enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.400" end="01:36:13.660" style="s2">used in those kind of things and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.990" end="01:36:15.700" style="s2">noticed that when I try to share those</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.660" end="01:36:17.710" style="s2">things it&#39;s difficult for people to get</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.700" end="01:36:19.780" style="s2">into it and there are important reasons</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.710" end="01:36:21.790" style="s2">for that so even if it&#39;s already created</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.780" end="01:36:23.560" style="s2">a tool you know there might be some</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.790" end="01:36:25.210" style="s2">tools online that are you know good</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.560" end="01:36:28.630" style="s2">enough for us to use right now we</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.210" end="01:36:31.360" style="s2">reluctant to join them partially because</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.630" end="01:36:35.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like more channels more chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.360" end="01:36:37.600" style="s2">you know more complexity at least but or</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.230" end="01:36:40.750" style="s2">more people to interact with so our</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.600" end="01:36:45.550" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s number is already to do too but</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.750" end="01:36:48.310" style="s2">I think that just brings back just to to</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.550" end="01:36:50.560" style="s2">our own limitation like even if</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.310" end="01:36:52.750" style="s2">everything is you know almost ready for</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.560" end="01:36:53.530" style="s2">you you know a free event there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.750" end="01:36:57.040" style="s2">snacks and</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.530" end="01:36:58.960" style="s2">you might still not come you might still</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.040" end="01:37:02.020" style="s2">not come because you know something some</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.960" end="01:37:03.580" style="s2">part of you inside says no you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.020" end="01:37:05.470" style="s2">I see that the direction you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.580" end="01:37:07.210" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna tell you there go go</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.470" end="01:37:09.760" style="s2">there you know back to bed</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.210" end="01:37:11.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even because you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.760" end="01:37:13.210" style="s2">you&#39;re not really capable if you would</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.290" end="01:37:15.340" style="s2">just you know persist you have you would</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.210" end="01:37:17.440" style="s2">have probably enough perseverance and</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.340" end="01:37:19.630" style="s2">patience to go through it and then yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.440" end="01:37:22.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit tiring but I did it yes I</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.630" end="01:37:25.540" style="s2">participated yeah I got something from</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.840" end="01:37:28.150" style="s2">it I was in it but many times I think we</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.540" end="01:37:31.900" style="s2">just we follow what&#39;s inside that the</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.150" end="01:37:36.190" style="s2">voice inside the autonomous automatic</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.900" end="01:37:38.130" style="s2">parts that were developed many years ago</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.190" end="01:37:40.600" style="s2">which are still responsible for our</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.130" end="01:37:43.060" style="s2">automatically for our needs and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.600" end="01:37:46.260" style="s2">they&#39;d get to choose so the monkey brain</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.060" end="01:37:50.320" style="s2">the monkey mind the the lizard brain and</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.260" end="01:37:57.370" style="s2">everybody has that and and so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.320" end="01:37:59.470" style="s2">the biggest part of the problem then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.370" end="01:38:01.780" style="s2">saying it I&#39;m just assuming that if if</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.470" end="01:38:03.940" style="s2">that is big one of the biggest parts or</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.780" end="01:38:06.400" style="s2">the biggest then we still have like a</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.940" end="01:38:08.650" style="s2">very long history that is just dragging</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.400" end="01:38:10.390" style="s2">along so it will be difficult I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.650" end="01:38:13.870" style="s2">saying it&#39;s impossible to summon it</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.390" end="01:38:16.570" style="s2">gonna be damn hard to deal with it every</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.870" end="01:38:19.660" style="s2">day just like with meditation and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.570" end="01:38:21.550" style="s2">know you&#39;re yeah you try to be very</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.660" end="01:38:23.350" style="s2">aware of God what&#39;s going on and still</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.550" end="01:38:26.800" style="s2">you&#39;re most of the time you&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.350" end="01:38:27.910" style="s2">I agree that that&#39;s a huge part and</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.800" end="01:38:30.700" style="s2">something came up while you were</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.910" end="01:38:33.760" style="s2">speaking and I guess the opposite side I</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.700" end="01:38:36.160" style="s2">see creation so intimately intertwined</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.760" end="01:38:39.760" style="s2">with our own personal progress and our</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.160" end="01:38:44.140" style="s2">own personal evolution that is partly</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.760" end="01:38:46.510" style="s2">why I think we have trouble you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.140" end="01:38:48.700" style="s2">connecting with other people&#39;s works or</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.510" end="01:38:51.070" style="s2">projects because it&#39;s such a personal</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.700" end="01:38:53.560" style="s2">process of personal development so as</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.070" end="01:38:56.290" style="s2">we&#39;re creating it&#39;s helping us to evolve</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.560" end="01:38:58.240" style="s2">I think that&#39;s also part of it and why</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.290" end="01:39:01.450" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to do a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.240" end="01:39:03.930" style="s2">work yeah thank you just a short note</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.450" end="01:39:06.830" style="s2">you reminded me a conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.930" end="01:39:10.880" style="s2">Jabbar Matea was having where</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.830" end="01:39:12.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a video online out with DJ</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.880" end="01:39:14.870" style="s2">Qualls sack of virtues again practice</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.890" end="01:39:17.330" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you know Miam and</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.870" end="01:39:20.780" style="s2">but what he said there DJ Qualls say</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.330" end="01:39:22.910" style="s2">that whatever he is there to say to</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.780" end="01:39:25.070" style="s2">others he&#39;s actually saying to himself</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.910" end="01:39:27.350" style="s2">and even though he&#39;s made in many places</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.070" end="01:39:30.350" style="s2">and repeating that thing he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.350" end="01:39:32.420" style="s2">owning it as if he&#39;s not telling that to</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.350" end="01:39:35.390" style="s2">others it&#39;s just for some reason he</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.420" end="01:39:38.000" style="s2">needs to keep telling it to hear himself</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.390" end="01:39:39.890" style="s2">say it somehow like it&#39;s it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.000" end="01:39:41.630" style="s2">for others it&#39;s just like I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.890" end="01:39:43.580" style="s2">talking to you not because you need to</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.630" end="01:39:47.030" style="s2">hear it because I need to say it and to</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.580" end="01:39:49.790" style="s2">hear myself saying it and it just points</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.030" end="01:39:52.370" style="s2">me to my own value my own need that is</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.790" end="01:39:55.340" style="s2">not met I&#39;m still trying to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.370" end="01:39:57.110" style="s2">with myself that hey you keep on working</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.340" end="01:39:59.810" style="s2">this is not done you need to keep</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.110" end="01:40:01.340" style="s2">looking for people to to just be there</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.810" end="01:40:04.270" style="s2">to listen to you talk to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.340" end="01:40:07.100" style="s2">essentially so that&#39;s what came up</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.270" end="01:40:09.080" style="s2">coherent CEO is I think coming into this</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.100" end="01:40:11.480" style="s2">space that we&#39;re trying to come into you</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.080" end="01:40:13.100" style="s2">requires us to already be individuated</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.480" end="01:40:15.140" style="s2">authority have gone through that process</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.100" end="01:40:19.010" style="s2">of creating or the personal development</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.140" end="01:40:21.680" style="s2">to be able to sacrifice in a way and not</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.010" end="01:40:23.900" style="s2">need to build that to fill that for</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.680" end="01:40:25.790" style="s2">ourselves for that greater purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.900" end="01:40:27.830" style="s2">personal development and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.790" end="01:40:34.300" style="s2">really come into okay how can I help how</p>

<p begin="01:43:56.720" end="01:44:04.190" style="s2">days is so yeah that&#39;s how I think it</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.690" end="01:44:07.340" style="s2">probably is sort of each of us</p>

<p begin="01:48:55.960" end="01:48:59.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like us we&#39;ll find another group</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.370" end="01:49:03.010" style="s2">who does I&#39;m not sure I follow the</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.830" end="01:49:04.630" style="s2">question exactly what are the options</p>

<p begin="01:49:08.860" end="01:49:12.280" style="s2">would you try if you knew you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.570" end="01:49:14.590" style="s2">fail right like if you knew if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.280" end="01:49:16.270" style="s2">jumped off a building you would fly you</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.590" end="01:49:17.710" style="s2">would jump off a building if you knew</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.270" end="01:49:19.270" style="s2">you could start a business you knew is</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.710" end="01:49:22.210" style="s2">gonna be successful you would probably</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.270" end="01:49:23.830" style="s2">start the business right it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.210" end="01:49:25.690" style="s2">of failure and I just had it I remember</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.830" end="01:49:27.460" style="s2">what who was talking when I was like oh</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.690" end="01:49:31.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the same like that is the piece</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.460" end="01:49:34.120" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to solve is that one group of</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.030" end="01:49:35.410" style="s2">people having monopoly over you right</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.120" end="01:49:36.850" style="s2">saying that if you&#39;re not part of this</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.410" end="01:49:38.890" style="s2">group you lose something that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.850" end="01:49:41.140" style="s2">effectively only part of this group</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.890" end="01:49:43.060" style="s2">they&#39;re your you know family there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.140" end="01:49:44.860" style="s2">your religion they&#39;re your like whatever</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.060" end="01:49:47.380" style="s2">it happens to be it stops us from</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.860" end="01:49:49.750" style="s2">evolving so if people can easily find a</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.380" end="01:49:51.160" style="s2">new group of people they&#39;re more likely</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.750" end="01:49:52.750" style="s2">to be able to leave their older group</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.160" end="01:49:55.180" style="s2">right they&#39;re more likely to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.750" end="01:49:56.860" style="s2">evolve and grow if there&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.180" end="01:49:58.930" style="s2">they&#39;re right where it&#39;s not just a good</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.860" end="01:50:00.760" style="s2">dressed chance for us to turn us that</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.930" end="01:50:06.070" style="s2">message it oh you&#39;re welcome here and</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.760" end="01:50:07.690" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be just as good here know</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.070" end="01:50:08.890" style="s2">that there&#39;s like meetup there&#39;s faith</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.690" end="01:50:11.260" style="s2">like there&#39;s some where you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.890" end="01:50:13.010" style="s2">go to find new people that&#39;s easy right</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.260" end="01:50:15.199" style="s2">like you&#39;ve experienced it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.010" end="01:50:16.730" style="s2">easy does it make you show up better or</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.199" end="01:50:19.730" style="s2">worse in your community because that is</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.730" end="01:50:22.579" style="s2">to me the two places I found it more</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.730" end="01:50:25.400" style="s2">recent more happened to me in my life</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.579" end="01:50:27.139" style="s2">recently where my my actual physical</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.400" end="01:50:28.639" style="s2">community that I eat with it is like oh</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.139" end="01:50:31.309" style="s2">well if I got kicked out of here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.639" end="01:50:32.809" style="s2">missing I can&#39;t just I could get a new</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.309" end="01:50:34.940" style="s2">community there&#39;s more cohousing going</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.809" end="01:50:36.230" style="s2">on but I&#39;m it&#39;s not gonna be people who</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.940" end="01:50:37.849" style="s2">know my kid it&#39;s not going to be people</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.230" end="01:50:39.400" style="s2">who I&#39;ve seen their kids grow up right</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.849" end="01:50:42.079" style="s2">like there&#39;s something there that</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.400" end="01:50:44.469" style="s2">honestly I think stops the community</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.079" end="01:50:47.929" style="s2">from dealing with a lot of their</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.469" end="01:50:49.539" style="s2">because what if we stirred it all up and</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.929" end="01:50:51.860" style="s2">then we have to live together right</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.539" end="01:50:53.480" style="s2">something that happens like it&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.860" end="01:50:54.559" style="s2">to me like in a relationship when you</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.480" end="01:50:56.179" style="s2">break up and you both have this</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.559" end="01:50:57.710" style="s2">evolution former that doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.179" end="01:50:59.119" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a relationship for a</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.710" end="01:51:00.710" style="s2">really really really long time you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.119" end="01:51:02.719" style="s2">go hey I should go start going to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.710" end="01:51:05.329" style="s2">gym or you&#39;re like those things that end</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.719" end="01:51:07.550" style="s2">up being a catapult forward the same</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.329" end="01:51:09.320" style="s2">thing kind of happens in community for</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.550" end="01:51:10.969" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay well yeah we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.320" end="01:51:12.769" style="s2">enough so we&#39;re not gonna stir the boat</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.969" end="01:51:16.309" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a part of your identity</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.769" end="01:51:22.400" style="s2">right like you&#39;re not as genuine not as</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.309" end="01:51:24.079" style="s2">authentic yeah or someone seen you for</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.400" end="01:51:25.550" style="s2">who you are and then you not being part</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.079" end="01:51:28.510" style="s2">of it which comes at a cost and a</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.550" end="01:51:30.650" style="s2">benefit right like the communities</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.510" end="01:51:32.269" style="s2">cohesive enough that it&#39;s gonna stay</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.650" end="01:51:34.639" style="s2">together if you stir the pot it might</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.269" end="01:51:36.110" style="s2">not but if you don&#39;t stir the pot you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.639" end="01:51:37.820" style="s2">not gonna get to the level you could</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.110" end="01:51:39.110" style="s2">have been at right where it&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.820" end="01:51:40.550" style="s2">why aren&#39;t we dealing with this</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.110" end="01:51:41.989" style="s2">like this thing that came up that</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.550" end="01:51:43.070" style="s2">brought that up and me was this woman</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.989" end="01:51:44.449" style="s2">yelling at me and I was like what if I</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.070" end="01:51:45.860" style="s2">get kicked out of the project I was like</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.449" end="01:51:50.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not the one who did the bad</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.860" end="01:51:51.380" style="s2">thing and also yet um I could see cuz</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.030" end="01:51:52.969" style="s2">she had done the same thing to other</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.380" end="01:51:54.469" style="s2">people and they&#39;d all letting her get</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.969" end="01:51:56.809" style="s2">away with it I&#39;m like Oh cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.469" end="01:51:59.480" style="s2">live there this both costs me more and</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.809" end="01:52:01.340" style="s2">costs me less I can see the dysfunction</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.480" end="01:52:02.780" style="s2">and like I&#39;m not gonna be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.340" end="01:52:04.159" style="s2">deal with this dysfunction when I&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.780" end="01:52:05.690" style="s2">different hire like I don&#39;t live there</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.159" end="01:52:08.769" style="s2">and she owns her own house it does look</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.690" end="01:52:12.619" style="s2">there and so it was it different like I</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.769" end="01:52:14.210" style="s2">can see the the underlining tension that</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.619" end="01:52:15.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t talked about because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.210" end="01:52:17.559" style="s2">want to stir the pot right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.650" end="01:52:19.400" style="s2">want to have they don&#39;t want to be in</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.559" end="01:52:21.349" style="s2">negative relationship with their</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.400" end="01:52:22.550" style="s2">neighbors totally understandable and at</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.349" end="01:52:24.920" style="s2">the same time you&#39;re not going to have</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.550" end="01:52:26.270" style="s2">that as deep of a connection if you</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.920" end="01:52:28.680" style="s2">don&#39;t deal with that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.270" end="01:52:34.110" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s an interpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.680" end="01:52:35.670" style="s2">risk risk and opportunity so I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.110" end="01:52:37.230" style="s2">think you see the same sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.670" end="01:52:38.700" style="s2">I&#39;m going back to organizations again</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.230" end="01:52:42.090" style="s2">just because it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.700" end="01:52:44.160" style="s2">illustrate but you you know an</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.090" end="01:52:47.130" style="s2">organization will often get a consultant</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.160" end="01:52:48.840" style="s2">in to deal with the kind of you know a</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.130" end="01:52:50.820" style="s2">cultural problem or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.840" end="01:52:53.160" style="s2">that that they can&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.820" end="01:52:55.320" style="s2">themselves because the risk of you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.160" end="01:52:57.810" style="s2">like social ostracism or job loss</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.320" end="01:53:02.340" style="s2">whatever is too great for the people</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.810" end="01:53:05.730" style="s2">inside that organization you can also</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.340" end="01:53:07.260" style="s2">use him as a scapegoat yeah he did that</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.730" end="01:53:11.280" style="s2">all those changes we didn&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.260" end="01:53:13.350" style="s2">them like yeah yeah but it&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.280" end="01:53:15.600" style="s2">people can actually accept it and work</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.350" end="01:53:18.050" style="s2">yeah of course yeah you know which they</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.600" end="01:53:20.250" style="s2">can&#39;t do if it if it comes from inside</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.050" end="01:53:23.880" style="s2">another lesson I learned the hard way</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.250" end="01:53:26.010" style="s2">because I tend to do very odd risk math</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.880" end="01:53:31.110" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like okay if it&#39;s true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.010" end="01:53:32.790" style="s2">true and and so I have you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.110" end="01:53:36.030" style="s2">throughout you know throughout my career</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.790" end="01:53:38.540" style="s2">before I stepped away from it</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.030" end="01:53:41.040" style="s2">I very much was one of those people who</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.540" end="01:53:42.150" style="s2">took the bull by the horns you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.040" end="01:53:43.260" style="s2">mean is like if there was something</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.150" end="01:53:44.850" style="s2">there that needed to be said or if</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.260" end="01:53:46.050" style="s2">someone needed to look like an idiot or</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.850" end="01:53:48.510" style="s2">something like that I would always take</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.050" end="01:53:50.010" style="s2">on that role I&#39;m down with that too I</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.510" end="01:53:51.750" style="s2">think it&#39;s a very needed part of society</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.010" end="01:53:55.170" style="s2">but it&#39;s also very vilified part of</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.750" end="01:53:56.730" style="s2">society we this is lowering right no</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.170" end="01:53:58.230" style="s2">okay so I&#39;m gonna pay because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.730" end="01:53:59.880" style="s2">my purse I&#39;m like how could you know</p>

<p begin="01:53:59.880" end="01:54:03.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand and yet there&#39;s tons</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.190" end="01:54:06.180" style="s2">of people who knew it needed to be said</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.600" end="01:54:08.490" style="s2">and knew not to say it but someone has</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.180" end="01:54:09.960" style="s2">to say it would you stop with this woman</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.490" end="01:54:11.250" style="s2">I was like oh so I wasn&#39;t the only one I</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.960" end="01:54:13.650" style="s2">guess it wasn&#39;t me then I was like wait</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.250" end="01:54:15.300" style="s2">a minute what do you mean I wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.650" end="01:54:16.800" style="s2">only one she&#39;s been freaking out on all</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.300" end="01:54:19.380" style="s2">of you and you just been letting her do</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.800" end="01:54:24.150" style="s2">this this is not acceptable community</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.380" end="01:54:26.250" style="s2">behavior and like yeah I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.150" end="01:54:27.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sound like criticizing but</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.250" end="01:54:29.970" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re saying I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.930" end="01:54:32.190" style="s2">understand essentially you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.970" end="01:54:34.620" style="s2">you&#39;re still well first of all lacking</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.190" end="01:54:37.200" style="s2">the information about their motives and</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.620" end="01:54:38.159" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re saying I&#39;m not still</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.200" end="01:54:41.070" style="s2">able to empathize</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.159" end="01:54:42.510" style="s2">why you made those decisions so this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.070" end="01:54:44.939" style="s2">kind of a maybe a good signal for</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.510" end="01:54:47.070" style="s2">yourself to realize that you you could</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.939" end="01:54:48.929" style="s2">actually understand and see the way they</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.070" end="01:54:50.929" style="s2">see probably you you would choose the</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.929" end="01:54:54.869" style="s2">same things if you were in their place</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.929" end="01:54:57.689" style="s2">because they have reasons so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.869" end="01:55:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a warning sign that something new</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.689" end="01:55:04.320" style="s2">has happened essentially that you were</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.400" end="01:55:06.809" style="s2">not expecting that happy you had a</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.320" end="01:55:08.489" style="s2">different impression of the system that</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.809" end="01:55:11.280" style="s2">you were expecting that they will be</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.489" end="01:55:12.929" style="s2">more forthright more honest about it or</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.280" end="01:55:16.079" style="s2">whatever and you suddenly realize that</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.929" end="01:55:19.260" style="s2">this is a kind of a crucial point it</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.079" end="01:55:24.869" style="s2">could be even like a you know some some</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.260" end="01:55:29.119" style="s2">warning about a collapse a possible</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.869" end="01:55:32.360" style="s2">chaotic you know thing coming your way</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.119" end="01:55:34.979" style="s2">yes III I noticed quite a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.360" end="01:55:37.979" style="s2">saying that yeah I don&#39;t even know why</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.979" end="01:55:41.070" style="s2">would you do that but thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.979" end="01:55:42.689" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with them that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.070" end="01:55:45.269" style="s2">choosing they might be choosing the</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.689" end="01:55:47.729" style="s2">wrong things but if you don&#39;t see why</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.269" end="01:55:51.059" style="s2">they do that so you still then you still</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.729" end="01:55:53.669" style="s2">don&#39;t see the system yeah the all the</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.059" end="01:55:56.189" style="s2">reasons that arose in that sense to that</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.669" end="01:55:58.619" style="s2">occasion yeah and that is how I get</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.189" end="01:56:00.570" style="s2">there it&#39;s like first F in that like</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.619" end="01:56:02.039" style="s2">wait why no and I understand and then</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.570" end="01:56:03.090" style="s2">understanding like right because they</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.039" end="01:56:04.650" style="s2">live there and they don&#39;t want to stir</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.090" end="01:56:06.239" style="s2">the pot and like I understand why she</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.650" end="01:56:10.079" style="s2">did what she did even though it was in</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.239" end="01:56:11.849" style="s2">no way okay like it is but my issue is I</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.079" end="01:56:13.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t understand are</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.849" end="01:56:15.269" style="s2">two of the major thoughts that go</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.289" end="01:56:16.769" style="s2">through my head that I have over done in</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.269" end="01:56:20.130" style="s2">my life like so I&#39;ve learned everything</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.769" end="01:56:22.499" style="s2">to co-op coat whatever the I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.130" end="01:56:24.090" style="s2">and I don&#39;t understand so like I got an</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.499" end="01:56:26.219" style="s2">opinion everything so because it</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.090" end="01:56:27.780" style="s2">happened so often for me I don&#39;t open be</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.219" end="01:56:29.639" style="s2">that easy for it to be a trigger but I</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.780" end="01:56:32.010" style="s2">will try to keep it when about other</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.639" end="01:56:34.229" style="s2">people at least I don&#39;t know can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.010" end="01:56:37.139" style="s2">because it&#39;s so often it&#39;s just like my</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.229" end="01:56:40.669" style="s2">constant thought but I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.139" end="01:56:43.919" style="s2">maybe when it&#39;s about somebody else and</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.669" end="01:56:45.959" style="s2">I think it&#39;s still okay to have those</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.919" end="01:56:48.599" style="s2">but maybe you can include I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.959" end="01:56:51.360" style="s2">you know showing the do towards miss</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.599" end="01:56:52.090" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know yet and I want to know</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.360" end="01:56:54.570" style="s2">or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.090" end="01:56:58.420" style="s2">understand yet and I want rather than</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.570" end="01:57:00.250" style="s2">more like this almost being dismayed at</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.420" end="01:57:02.440" style="s2">least there was a kind of a tension of</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.250" end="01:57:04.000" style="s2">that like why would you do like what</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.440" end="01:57:06.429" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with you rather than</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.000" end="01:57:08.440" style="s2">implying the wrong is the curiosity path</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.429" end="01:57:10.750" style="s2">like oh I didn&#39;t know this see that I</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.440" end="01:57:13.570" style="s2">wasn&#39;t right but I&#39;m really what I know</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.750" end="01:57:16.510" style="s2">why tell me more I think that because</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.570" end="01:57:19.030" style="s2">people help people appreciate it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.510" end="01:57:22.239" style="s2">okay yeah you did over to the Semyon but</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.030" end="01:57:25.239" style="s2">you want to I&#39;m gonna tell you now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.239" end="01:57:27.730" style="s2">gonna make it all clear also the</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.239" end="01:57:29.469" style="s2">possibly just asking instead of assuming</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.730" end="01:57:31.449" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand why would they</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.469" end="01:57:33.190" style="s2">possibly you that&#39;s ridiculous who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.449" end="01:57:34.659" style="s2">what Bentley the other person are a</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.190" end="01:57:36.040" style="s2">project it was much easier when he was</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.659" end="01:57:39.690" style="s2">like well then ask them why they why it</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.040" end="01:57:41.889" style="s2">doesn&#39;t appeal to them I&#39;m like ask them</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.690" end="01:57:43.989" style="s2">what&#39;s this I didn&#39;t want to make all</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.889" end="01:57:46.119" style="s2">the assumptions in my head ask them and</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.989" end="01:57:48.790" style="s2">get an actual answer why don&#39;t you guys</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.119" end="01:57:52.630" style="s2">confront her why is this okay unity is</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.790" end="01:57:55.929" style="s2">more yeah would be more helpful than me</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.630" end="01:57:58.780" style="s2">and and then even going one one more</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.929" end="01:58:01.060" style="s2">step back appreciating yourself being</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.780" end="01:58:03.849" style="s2">with with the way you are in that like</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.060" end="01:58:06.340" style="s2">why would you even that is meeting your</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.849" end="01:58:08.320" style="s2">knees right now so it&#39;s there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.340" end="01:58:10.210" style="s2">wrong with it might not help you</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.320" end="01:58:13.599" style="s2">sometimes to meet other needs but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.210" end="01:58:15.520" style="s2">still I don&#39;t think like everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.599" end="01:58:18.219" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get all that in my head</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.520" end="01:58:20.349" style="s2">I want life to be easier that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.219" end="01:58:22.630" style="s2">would just be more responsible like I am</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.349" end="01:58:25.119" style="s2">like why would I need to keep thing like</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.630" end="01:58:26.949" style="s2">so there&#39;s also value in that as well is</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.119" end="01:58:29.170" style="s2">just like it maybe it&#39;s difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.949" end="01:58:30.940" style="s2">people to understand it before you</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.170" end="01:58:34.840" style="s2">communicate why you don&#39;t want to take</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.940" end="01:58:36.580" style="s2">that responsibility and yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.840" end="01:58:38.110" style="s2">multiple options I guess the only</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.580" end="01:58:40.510" style="s2">problem is that if people will</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.110" end="01:58:43.900" style="s2">misunderstand your intention then then</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.510" end="01:58:46.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a conflict arising so yeah which</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.900" end="01:58:49.510" style="s2">is yeah letting go conflict I think of</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.780" end="01:58:52.060" style="s2">anyone needing to understand me is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.510" end="01:58:54.040" style="s2">the only step I can control and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.060" end="01:58:56.710" style="s2">hard step it&#39;s hard step to be like</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.040" end="01:59:01.179" style="s2">right you might come off stupid and lazy</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.710" end="01:59:04.449" style="s2">and X&amp;Y and okay okay it&#39;s a hard step</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.179" end="01:59:05.500" style="s2">to get to but it&#39;s furniture personal</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.449" end="01:59:10.210" style="s2">development that</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.500" end="01:59:12.760" style="s2">an important step yeah yeah I would say</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.210" end="01:59:15.040" style="s2">within reason like having sort of done</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.760" end="01:59:17.620" style="s2">that so frequently myself it&#39;s it burns</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.040" end="01:59:19.560" style="s2">you up you know what I mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.620" end="01:59:23.080" style="s2">because we are actually social creatures</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.560" end="01:59:25.300" style="s2">the which burns you out sorry to be the</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.080" end="01:59:29.200" style="s2">the stepping back and kind of going</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.300" end="01:59:30.700" style="s2">who cares if they see me as this that</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.200" end="01:59:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing because we are actually</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.700" end="01:59:35.410" style="s2">social creatures you can only or at</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.520" end="01:59:39.700" style="s2">least as I&#39;ve done anyway can only push</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.410" end="01:59:41.320" style="s2">it so far and you know where I ended up</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.700" end="01:59:46.030" style="s2">finding out that I pushed it too far as</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.320" end="01:59:46.720" style="s2">my body told me you know it just tasted</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.030" end="01:59:52.900" style="s2">capsized</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.720" end="01:59:55.840" style="s2">pretty much so you know even if it seems</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.900" end="01:59:57.430" style="s2">like the right thing to do even if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.840" end="01:59:58.620" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense to</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.430" end="02:00:01.720" style="s2">just sort of go along with groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.620" end="02:00:04.860" style="s2">you know and and so on it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.720" end="02:00:09.100" style="s2">there are limits to how much you can</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.860" end="02:00:12.490" style="s2">push it I think I mean in terms of yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.100" end="02:00:14.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a risk involved yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.490" end="02:00:17.710" style="s2">these are make the most that you can</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.290" end="02:00:20.290" style="s2">expect of yourself I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.710" end="02:00:23.140" style="s2">sort of understanding that we are that</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.290" end="02:00:27.760" style="s2">we are social creatures saying anyway</p>
