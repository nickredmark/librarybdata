<p begin="00:02:53.800" end="00:02:58.730" style="s2">so just start if somebody has like</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.379" end="00:03:04.060" style="s2">something they really want to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.730" end="00:03:04.060" style="s2">there in speech versus the chat or</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.330" end="00:03:10.580" style="s2">somebody had any insight or something</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.599" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">happened to them that played off of some</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.580" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">of the work we&#39;ve been doing that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:43.960" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">what you know kind of like made some</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:52.850" style="s2">suggestions of what we might do I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:55.190" style="s2">someone I think it&#39;s Tanya keeps asking</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.850" end="00:03:57.740" style="s2">me that I should talk about myself which</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.190" end="00:03:59.540" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to do but I think Peter</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.740" end="00:04:02.360" style="s2">and I might have an interview at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.540" end="00:04:04.220" style="s2">point yeah so we are gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">the dark side of meditation a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.220" end="00:04:10.910" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start getting in that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">little and we have three themes that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.910" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">trying to weave together today and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">see which one has more energy right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:23.090" style="s2">okay start with three and and and we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.209" end="00:04:25.610" style="s2">mash them up and then see where we want</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.090" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">to go and the three are is some</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.610" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">conversation around spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">different approaches is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">critique of not necessarily the practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:40.070" style="s2">themselves but the way the general</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">population tends to relate to these</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.070" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">practices some communities are more</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">effective than others some teachers more</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:55.160" style="s2">serious than others but just try to talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:57.760" style="s2">about some common traps that basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.160" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">people in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.760" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">Westerners from the abrete faiths that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:10.669" style="s2">important because we tend to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:15.140" style="s2">theological orientation we we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.669" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">have a theological relationship to some</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.140" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">of the what Eastern practices it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:28.820" style="s2">seeps in into our orientation to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:30.740" style="s2">work then I wanted to try to underscore</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.820" end="00:05:32.300" style="s2">some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.740" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">they&#39;re meeting making around this</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.300" end="00:05:40.569" style="s2">instead of just critique with some</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:40.569" style="s2">poetry I use in it for insight practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.229" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">just kind of an alternative approach to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.729" end="00:05:56.840" style="s2">maybe touching base with some of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:06:02.690" style="s2">important features of insight and I also</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.840" end="00:06:06.289" style="s2">want to open up questions if they are in</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.690" end="00:06:07.849" style="s2">the space about current events and since</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.289" end="00:06:09.979" style="s2">making around current events to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.849" end="00:06:15.819" style="s2">some of this practical you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.979" end="00:06:20.060" style="s2">then have not yet spoken out about any</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.819" end="00:06:28.150" style="s2">any of my opinions on kovat or this new</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.060" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">round of riots and police violence so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.150" end="00:06:33.169" style="s2">yeah if the energy is there we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">go toward that use some of this towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.169" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">sense making in this space I&#39;d be happy</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">to look at some questions that that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">might have part of what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:53.180" style="s2">trying to do is some of these practices</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:55.870" style="s2">if we were part of a community and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.180" end="00:06:58.430" style="s2">had more time together they would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.870" end="00:07:01.669" style="s2">practices that helped us tame our mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:04.069" style="s2">so we can approach talking about current</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.669" end="00:07:08.090" style="s2">events in a way that doesn&#39;t get sucked</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.069" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">into the chaos right so that you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.090" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">that every statement gets sucked in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:16.449" style="s2">makes more chaos gets sucked into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:19.669" style="s2">chaos and this would be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.449" end="00:07:21.880" style="s2">approach that says no first as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.669" end="00:07:25.190" style="s2">community we have to take my mind and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.880" end="00:07:32.469" style="s2">then we can start talking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.190" end="00:07:40.339" style="s2">these current events let&#39;s start with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.469" end="00:07:44.599" style="s2">provocative statement and the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.339" end="00:07:48.849" style="s2">problem with try</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.599" end="00:07:54.020" style="s2">to have spiritual instruction let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.849" end="00:07:58.569" style="s2">with with modern people let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.020" end="00:08:03.219" style="s2">modern people is that we come to know</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.569" end="00:08:03.219" style="s2">the teachings but we don&#39;t believe them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.559" end="00:08:11.209" style="s2">so we come to know and you can hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.139" end="00:08:15.110" style="s2">someone pair a million times a day we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.209" end="00:08:16.969" style="s2">all one and the first behavior they make</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:18.279" style="s2">afterwards shows you they don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.969" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.279" end="00:08:22.249" style="s2">this is a huge problem and people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.930" end="00:08:25.610" style="s2">not called out on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.249" end="00:08:30.430" style="s2">whole communities run around expressing</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.610" end="00:08:33.110" style="s2">knowledge of many deep principles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.430" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">the first step out of the door shows you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.110" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2">- you don&#39;t believe it and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:58.009" style="s2">is I think Bill Gates is working on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.540" end="00:09:00.439" style="s2">vaccine for this product so the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.009" end="00:09:06.709" style="s2">thing to do when you are if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.439" end="00:09:09.430" style="s2">interested in doing this work is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.709" end="00:09:12.829" style="s2">touch base with what you really believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.430" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">we have to trust that it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.829" end="00:09:18.589" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s the problem you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">enter in the spiritual community and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.589" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">there&#39;s already implicit sanctions</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:27.949" style="s2">you&#39;re already trained not to say what</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.329" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">you believe because you already know</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.949" end="00:09:34.870" style="s2">that there&#39;s like this dissenters in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:37.430" style="s2">through these walls and this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:38.779" style="s2">yeah so do they not believe but not live</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:40.970" style="s2">from that belief I&#39;m saying it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">same thing I&#39;m saying that the body</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.970" end="00:09:46.939" style="s2">believes so if the body believes okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:49.009" style="s2">here&#39;s like for example let me the guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.939" end="00:09:52.579" style="s2">at Burning Man that was hallucinating</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.009" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">and ran into the fire he truly believed</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.579" end="00:09:58.190" style="s2">that there was there was nothing to harm</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.140" style="s2">him or that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.190" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what he was doing he truly</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.140" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">believed in the philosopher that says</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:06.890" style="s2">cause and effect is an illusion doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:09.170" style="s2">really believe it because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.890" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">they still careful when they drive it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.170" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">car like so belief is in what the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.470" end="00:10:23.530" style="s2">does the actions show you your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">and the first step is not then to try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.530" end="00:10:31.690" style="s2">distort your actions into what you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:31.690" style="s2">but is to settle with what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.020" end="00:10:40.610" style="s2">to settle with what is real in your</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.180" end="00:10:43.010" style="s2">experience and any decent teacher will</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.610" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">not reject that the problem is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.010" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the cost in society is like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:11:02.420" style="s2">get shamed for these things but any</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:04.040" style="s2">decent teacher won&#39;t reject that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.420" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.040" end="00:11:09.140" style="s2">about last week in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:11.290" style="s2">contracted effects are are is material</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.140" end="00:11:15.710" style="s2">to work with its energy to work with and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.290" end="00:11:22.310" style="s2">so these beliefs are energy to work with</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.710" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">now if you have two people in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.310" end="00:11:29.660" style="s2">conversation and one person is a racist</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">and they know they&#39;re a racist and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.660" end="00:11:36.590" style="s2">believe what they think and the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:41.450" style="s2">person is thinks they&#39;re not a racist</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.590" end="00:11:44.150" style="s2">but there&#39;s some disconnect between</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.450" end="00:11:47.900" style="s2">their behavior and what they say or</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.150" end="00:11:51.970" style="s2">their nonviolent then we have a formula</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.900" end="00:11:51.970" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting here</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.240" end="00:12:32.110" style="s2">we have unexamined assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.280" end="00:12:37.110" style="s2">what we know versus what we believe so</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.110" end="00:12:37.110" style="s2">this is an interesting beginning</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:54.220" style="s2">okay so storytelling those a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:59.230" style="s2">times and trying to get to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.220" end="00:13:04.390" style="s2">what we really believe things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.230" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">storytelling poetry art they unlock this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.390" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">this this mind that&#39;s once to know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:14.650" style="s2">we believe as if you can know what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:18.490" style="s2">believe the belief is is is the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.650" end="00:13:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the larger set right the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.490" end="00:13:39.070" style="s2">is yeah so how do we how do we look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:42.930" style="s2">what is in our deep beliefs so one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.070" end="00:13:45.370" style="s2">the ways to do this is through being</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.930" end="00:13:52.750" style="s2">metacognitive we can go down that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.370" end="00:13:54.910" style="s2">look at that a little bit and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.750" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">the this is just an example</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.910" end="00:14:01.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a simplistic overly simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">example so one of the ways knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.480" end="00:14:08.769" style="s2">belief works is like we like this let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.420" end="00:14:10.839" style="s2">say you saw</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.769" end="00:14:13.239" style="s2">a picture I saw it&#39;s actually I think on</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.839" end="00:14:15.100" style="s2">the internet so a picture with a child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.239" end="00:14:19.269" style="s2">face on the ground with a boot on its</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.100" end="00:14:22.119" style="s2">neck then you zoom out you see he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.269" end="00:14:24.069" style="s2">his hand in the boot right and you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.119" end="00:14:28.389" style="s2">say you have another different whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.069" end="00:14:31.389" style="s2">frame right then you zoom out you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.389" end="00:14:33.069" style="s2">there&#39;s a person holding a gun to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.389" end="00:14:34.809" style="s2">child so he puts his hand in the boot</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.069" end="00:14:35.410" style="s2">and takes the photo op with the boot on</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.809" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">his neck</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.410" end="00:14:42.339" style="s2">now you switched again right then use</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:43.779" style="s2">your mom you see there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.339" end="00:14:46.199" style="s2">camera people and it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.779" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">action shot for a movie</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.199" end="00:14:55.029" style="s2">now you&#39;ve switched again we can go on</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:59.410" style="s2">and on and this is something the month</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.029" end="00:15:04.410" style="s2">then the knowledge mine does its beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.410" end="00:15:11.980" style="s2">keep reframing the perceptual experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.410" end="00:15:13.720" style="s2">to fit the belief and you can do this in</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.980" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">your own head or you can just serve</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.720" end="00:15:20.949" style="s2">social media to find frames that slide</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:23.429" style="s2">get more or less adapt to your to your</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.949" end="00:15:23.429" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:53.090" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna read a poem that talks</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.360" end="00:15:59.480" style="s2">about this it&#39;s not a story but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.090" end="00:16:04.700" style="s2">congregate around ideas like ants to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.480" end="00:16:11.660" style="s2">drop of syrup not knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.700" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">forces of adhesion can do us in but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.660" end="00:16:19.940" style="s2">somewhere inside this not knowing is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">fear that prevents us from moving too</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.940" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">close and drowning there in the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:39.290" style="s2">taste of certainty therefore like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:42.260" style="s2">ants we set about in a swirl around the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.290" end="00:16:49.400" style="s2">thing that has gathered us in a shape</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.260" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">that mimics the Milky Way under the hot</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.400" end="00:16:58.100" style="s2">Sun the syrup runs and small streams of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">sweet knowing stick to our feet and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.100" end="00:17:05.180" style="s2">are forced to lick them clean or forever</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:12.140" style="s2">be held in place when the chill of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.180" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">evening a glutton eise&#39;s us but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.140" end="00:17:19.130" style="s2">memory of that sweet taste the brain in</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">its servants adhered to for a long long</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.130" end="00:17:27.050" style="s2">time and therefore when the SAP runs</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">once again and seeps upon the ground the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.050" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">ants will show up regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">weather to worship their</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.860" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">so one thing about a poem like this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.060" end="00:18:07.860" style="s2">it shows you it&#39;s kind of humbling</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">because even in the realm of ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.860" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">mean I think I take it literally in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">realm of ideas we are reenacting</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">something very fundamental and basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:28.230" style="s2">about how life is it&#39;s fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:34.190" style="s2">basic this notion of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.230" end="00:18:39.480" style="s2">ourselves in this compassionate way</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.190" end="00:18:44.280" style="s2">understanding how you know we two are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.480" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">like the ants we two are moving toward</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.280" end="00:18:54.630" style="s2">things with both desire and fear we too</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:57.000" style="s2">can get trapped these are very important</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.630" end="00:18:59.670" style="s2">things to us but we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.000" end="00:19:02.040" style="s2">that this is part of our existential</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.670" end="00:19:04.650" style="s2">being it&#39;s part of what it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.040" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">similar to the processes we see in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.650" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">nature we can we need to approach this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:16.620" style="s2">with that kind of compassion the folly</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:21.980" style="s2">of the ants all they love this era and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.620" end="00:19:21.980" style="s2">yet got called and now they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.550" end="00:19:41.960" style="s2">this is interesting about people even</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.560" end="00:19:45.410" style="s2">the shape we take around these is like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:47.960" style="s2">circle like the spiraling finally</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.410" end="00:19:51.950" style="s2">spiraling thing to see this and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.960" end="00:19:53.960" style="s2">light is to it&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.950" end="00:19:56.360" style="s2">framing it&#39;s not like the framing I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.960" end="00:19:58.700" style="s2">told with the boy with the boo which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.360" end="00:20:10.010" style="s2">like one story frame it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.700" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">gets down tries to get down to its some</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.010" end="00:20:24.310" style="s2">level we are made like this that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:27.310" style="s2">and then we can explore potentials for</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.310" end="00:20:27.310" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.739" end="00:21:05.429" style="s2">anybody have a comment just noticing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.539" end="00:21:12.779" style="s2">taste of a different approach at</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.429" end="00:21:15.239" style="s2">different the you know we were working</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.779" end="00:21:21.299" style="s2">with perception and the perception</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.239" end="00:21:28.070" style="s2">noticing noticing in the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.299" end="00:21:31.529" style="s2">is the way we are and not getting so</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.070" end="00:21:35.119" style="s2">carried away with how sophisticated it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.529" end="00:21:35.119" style="s2">is in content</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.580" end="00:22:28.269" style="s2">and it builds compassion for the living</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.389" end="00:22:32.619" style="s2">world I once had this huge insight with</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.269" end="00:22:37.809" style="s2">an ant I was sitting on the toilet as</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.619" end="00:22:40.179" style="s2">you do and I was lingering for some</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.809" end="00:22:43.210" style="s2">reason it was at the other house it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.179" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">a tiny house and we had a lot of dogs</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:50.019" style="s2">and I was looking down and I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:53.529" style="s2">ant trying to make its way across the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.019" end="00:22:56.730" style="s2">floor and there&#39;s like it got caught up</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.529" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">in a tangle of dog hair</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.730" end="00:23:02.200" style="s2">right so for the ant to get from here</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:04.059" style="s2">that this you know like 8 inches later</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.200" end="00:23:06.129" style="s2">or three inches later it had to go up</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.059" end="00:23:09.519" style="s2">this hair and down and it had to like go</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.129" end="00:23:11.970" style="s2">through this and like there was and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.519" end="00:23:16.899" style="s2">was just a you know a happy little like</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.970" end="00:23:19.299" style="s2">he was just negotiating that that and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.899" end="00:23:24.820" style="s2">makes it to the other side and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.299" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">like I felt that the sense of that of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.820" end="00:23:31.480" style="s2">being on the other side of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:35.169" style="s2">I had this crazy insight like all of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.480" end="00:23:37.690" style="s2">sudden I had this mental model because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.169" end="00:23:39.489" style="s2">thought you know the ants I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.690" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t come like in sequential it just</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.489" end="00:23:47.950" style="s2">was all at once and I thought the ant</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:51.340" style="s2">has no idea that that whole journey he</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.950" end="00:23:55.090" style="s2">had it was just a piece of hairball on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.340" end="00:23:57.669" style="s2">floor in a toilet you know in a bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.090" end="00:24:01.269" style="s2">and a little cabin in Northwest</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.669" end="00:24:02.950" style="s2">Connecticut in a country on a planet in</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.269" end="00:24:07.029" style="s2">a solar system in a world like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.950" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">distance between the ant and my</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.029" end="00:24:14.830" style="s2">perspective I just got this huge head ah</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">but then I realized that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.830" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">is that much difference between my</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:28.179" style="s2">perspective and reality also and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:30.330" style="s2">was the insight the Indian at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.179" end="00:24:42.010" style="s2">stomach humility some people call it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:45.519" style="s2">that&#39;s the insight so the frame the zoom</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.010" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">level in which you address these</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.519" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">questions is important now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:56.409" style="s2">saying that the zoom level at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:59.080" style="s2">highest possible imaginary is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.409" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">appropriate to all these things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.080" end="00:25:05.470" style="s2">like you know the spiritual person who</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:09.490" style="s2">nothing you know it&#39;s all it&#39;s all Lila</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.470" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">okay not saying that that&#39;s the response</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.490" end="00:25:15.370" style="s2">you should take the question is at what</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:18.669" style="s2">level since you&#39;re going to frame</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.370" end="00:25:21.610" style="s2">something anyways where&#39;s the leverage</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.669" end="00:25:24.870" style="s2">point in this where is the leverage</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.610" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">point in politics today to left-right</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.870" end="00:25:31.059" style="s2">discourse I don&#39;t think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:33.070" style="s2">that&#39;s he needs a zoom out where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.059" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">leverage in your spirituality today</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.070" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">maybe that needs a real dive deep in</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">right so this is part of the when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:51.669" style="s2">trying to know something or inquire a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:55.480" style="s2">big part of what&#39;s operating and your</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.669" end="00:25:58.750" style="s2">mental model or is this virtual point of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.480" end="00:26:00.909" style="s2">reference this virtual frame of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.750" end="00:26:03.389" style="s2">reference from which you are asking the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.909" end="00:26:03.389" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:20.970" style="s2">and so this is a level of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.230" end="00:26:26.029" style="s2">that is sophisticated but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.970" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">we as communities need to be working on</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.029" end="00:26:34.409" style="s2">because it&#39;s a skill it&#39;s like having a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">lot of tools in your toolbox and do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.409" end="00:26:39.179" style="s2">want to use the microscope or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:45.960" style="s2">telescope or the oscilloscope I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.179" end="00:26:48.539" style="s2">what is the appropriate frame of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.960" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">reference inertial frame what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.539" end="00:27:06.690" style="s2">the position that you are speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:27:14.909" style="s2">I mean I read one other poem and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.690" end="00:27:16.889" style="s2">talk about systems thinking okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.909" end="00:27:17.309" style="s2">an interesting question that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.889" end="00:27:18.899" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.309" end="00:27:20.220" style="s2">pray deeper seeing the frame you choose</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.899" end="00:27:25.019" style="s2">will be dependent on what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.220" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">want to do right it should be tied to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.019" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">should be transparent to your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">and your choice or your action and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:40.379" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for what frame has the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.980" end="00:27:42.210" style="s2">biggest the greatest leverage point this</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.379" end="00:27:44.100" style="s2">makes me think of a story I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.210" end="00:27:47.429" style="s2">going to tell this story how many people</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.100" end="00:27:50.129" style="s2">saw the movie the there was a remake</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.429" end="00:27:52.769" style="s2">with Jodie Foster and Yul Brenner I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.129" end="00:27:55.019" style="s2">think there&#39;s an earlier version of The</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.769" end="00:27:59.369" style="s2">King and I I think it&#39;s called the King</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.019" end="00:28:05.399" style="s2">and I and it&#39;s the story of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.369" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">naive young British woman who gets a job</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.399" end="00:28:11.730" style="s2">teaching the King of Siam his children</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:15.149" style="s2">Western you know English Western</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.730" end="00:28:17.659" style="s2">languages and Western science Oh Anne in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.149" end="00:28:20.369" style="s2">the king Anna the king</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.659" end="00:28:22.269" style="s2">thank you I know I&#39;ve made that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.369" end="00:28:24.700" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.269" end="00:28:27.789" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an interesting scene</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.700" end="00:28:30.269" style="s2">where the people are going to stone this</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.789" end="00:28:33.249" style="s2">woman to death for light I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.269" end="00:28:34.929" style="s2">silly reason you know like I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.249" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">think she cheated on her husband she</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.929" end="00:28:39.940" style="s2">just didn&#39;t want to get married or</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:45.969" style="s2">something or maybe she I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.940" end="00:28:47.559" style="s2">something like that and Anna and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.969" end="00:28:49.839" style="s2">King have a very complex relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.559" end="00:28:56.769" style="s2">that they&#39;re like in love on a deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.839" end="00:28:59.109" style="s2">level and they&#39;re very respectful and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.769" end="00:29:01.209" style="s2">when this is happening she goes to him</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.109" end="00:29:07.749" style="s2">he says you have to stop it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.209" end="00:29:13.599" style="s2">stop it and he he does it and she can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.749" end="00:29:16.359" style="s2">figure out why he won&#39;t go out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.599" end="00:29:20.289" style="s2">forbid this woman from being stoned and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.359" end="00:29:22.539" style="s2">then eventually Anna and he tells Anna</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.289" end="00:29:24.579" style="s2">no that&#39;s not how it works you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.539" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">mean this is kind of bastardizing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.579" end="00:29:28.419" style="s2">really a beautiful movie but he&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.119" style="s2">the King goes is that if he goes out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.419" end="00:29:33.669" style="s2">says stop it the population will know</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.119" end="00:29:36.609" style="s2">that he&#39;s adopted Western values and now</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.669" end="00:29:39.789" style="s2">he&#39;s becoming a dictator on it right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.609" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">so he believes he doesn&#39;t say this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.789" end="00:29:44.019" style="s2">her she doesn&#39;t quite get why he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:46.839" style="s2">stopping it because she&#39;s grown to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.019" end="00:29:49.989" style="s2">really admire and love him and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.839" end="00:29:54.059" style="s2">share a lot of common Western values and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.989" end="00:29:57.309" style="s2">so he he spends all night praying and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.059" end="00:30:00.940" style="s2">the mob is getting more and more you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.309" end="00:30:03.789" style="s2">know riled up and the day of stoning to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.940" end="00:30:06.609" style="s2">death is coming and then she goes down</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.789" end="00:30:08.169" style="s2">to try to stop it and that ignites it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.609" end="00:30:11.499" style="s2">right away and they stoned the woman to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.169" end="00:30:15.159" style="s2">death and so the king is working with at</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.499" end="00:30:19.239" style="s2">the level of reality of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.159" end="00:30:21.009" style="s2">trying to leverage trust that the energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.239" end="00:30:23.109" style="s2">will blow out that the people will</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.009" end="00:30:27.599" style="s2">resolve it he prays all night and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.109" end="00:30:30.749" style="s2">tries to leverage the natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.599" end="00:30:34.119" style="s2">evolutionary potential in the system</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.749" end="00:30:36.160" style="s2">because he knows the opposite will make</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.119" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">it worse right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.160" end="00:30:42.400" style="s2">then Anna is horrified because she</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:44.770" style="s2">realizes that she basically was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.400" end="00:30:48.010" style="s2">cause of the woman being being stoned to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.770" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">death so this is I don&#39;t know why all</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.010" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">these things fit in the same thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:56.620" style="s2">kind of like the king has a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:31:03.010" style="s2">on people like we just had on the ants</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.620" end="00:31:06.790" style="s2">and the syrup there&#39;s something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.010" end="00:31:09.970" style="s2">something there&#39;s potential in what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.790" end="00:31:15.550" style="s2">have to work with and there&#39;s potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.970" end="00:31:20.170" style="s2">in what we actually believe even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.550" end="00:31:26.050" style="s2">quote-unquote I know better yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.170" end="00:31:27.880" style="s2">things don&#39;t don&#39;t they don&#39;t line up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.050" end="00:31:30.010" style="s2">an easy conclusion but I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.880" end="00:31:33.240" style="s2">getting the sense of a space that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.010" end="00:31:33.240" style="s2">working with now</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.490" end="00:31:56.659" style="s2">okay I&#39;m gonna read another another poem</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.519" end="00:32:00.100" style="s2">it shows kind of the opposite instead of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.659" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">like this notion of being sucked into</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.100" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">something that sweet certainty and being</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:17.750" style="s2">kind of adhered to it this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:20.360" style="s2">an opposite sentiment it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.750" end="00:32:28.269" style="s2">potential in in the human exhibit human</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.360" end="00:32:38.049" style="s2">condition the path has no entrance and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.269" end="00:32:38.049" style="s2">no exit still I find myself here on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.370" end="00:32:51.730" style="s2">the self has no entrance and no exit</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.179" end="00:32:51.730" style="s2">still the path is shaped into becoming</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.570" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">when the owl soars there is no sound</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.269" end="00:33:08.509" style="s2">the air spreads out before him releasing</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.509" end="00:33:25.490" style="s2">appears where does this world begin</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.260" end="00:35:06.410" style="s2">mental processes like yeah we can force</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.940" end="00:35:08.270" style="s2">something in there that&#39;s when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.410" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">following I mean it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.270" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">constitution then we&#39;re following a path</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.750" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">yeah yeah Sean is this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.670" end="00:35:32.180" style="s2">related to finding out what you truly</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:34.849" style="s2">believe by I guess I want to relate this</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.180" end="00:35:39.020" style="s2">to something that I&#39;ve been reading the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.849" end="00:35:45.460" style="s2">way to love describes not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.020" end="00:35:45.460" style="s2">change yourself but rather to understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:53.270" style="s2">in trying to dive into like what you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.660" end="00:36:00.619" style="s2">and like what you believe having the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.270" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">awareness I give I guess like give rise</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.619" end="00:36:06.470" style="s2">to the nature that actually oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:12.049" style="s2">really hard to talk about but um I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.470" end="00:36:13.549" style="s2">it&#39;s hmm there being a no path is sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.049" end="00:36:15.829" style="s2">of related to not being able to change</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.549" end="00:36:21.400" style="s2">yourself and having the awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.829" end="00:36:23.869" style="s2">your nature sort of give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.400" end="00:36:25.579" style="s2">whatever happens afterwards I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.869" end="00:36:27.410" style="s2">if he could talk around that at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.579" end="00:36:29.510" style="s2">or someone maybe somebody else can riff</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.410" end="00:36:38.440" style="s2">off of that I mean you know it&#39;s a rich</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.510" end="00:36:38.440" style="s2">poem so there&#39;s different nuances in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.540" end="00:36:50.590" style="s2">and I&#39;m remembering something that now</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.370" end="00:36:52.600" style="s2">Bateson said right now she&#39;s at one</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.590" end="00:36:57.100" style="s2">point she said she just found herself in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.600" end="00:37:01.080" style="s2">the middle of things and like I&#39;m this</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.100" end="00:37:04.990" style="s2">thing like this like energy seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.080" end="00:37:06.520" style="s2">gathering or like just in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.990" end="00:37:11.350" style="s2">and she&#39;s just and she said she just</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.520" end="00:37:14.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t exist yeah that&#39;s against a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.350" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">sense of no entrance and no exit like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.260" end="00:37:19.780" style="s2">constantly are framing our experience in</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:21.850" style="s2">where did it begin in where did it ends</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.780" end="00:37:25.480" style="s2">and what&#39;s the trajectory and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.850" end="00:37:38.230" style="s2">path so that&#39;s that&#39;s the mind of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.480" end="00:37:41.790" style="s2">walker and that&#39;s okay we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.230" end="00:37:41.790" style="s2">there&#39;s what many times we have to walk</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.150" end="00:37:56.140" style="s2">you know the sudden it reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.530" end="00:38:00.070" style="s2">Inception that&#39;s kind of where one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.140" end="00:38:01.600" style="s2">the ways he describes how she can tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.070" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">whether she&#39;s in the dream is because</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.600" end="00:38:05.020" style="s2">all the sudden you&#39;re just in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:08.190" style="s2">experience and you can&#39;t you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.020" end="00:38:08.190" style="s2">how you got there</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.200" end="00:38:14.380" style="s2">and then what are you following I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.470" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">you&#39;re following what&#39;s not there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.380" end="00:38:19.990" style="s2">kind of literal but for some reason I</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.490" style="s2">thought of those scenes because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.990" end="00:38:23.410" style="s2">very playful he gets very nervous</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.490" end="00:38:26.820" style="s2">because she&#39;s so playful with her</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.410" end="00:38:26.820" style="s2">newfound reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:51.110" style="s2">anybody else for me what comes up is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.980" end="00:38:53.510" style="s2">sense that you know when you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.110" end="00:38:57.860" style="s2">following a rhythm or a tune that only</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.510" end="00:39:02.600" style="s2">you hear from the outside to someone it</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.860" end="00:39:04.550" style="s2">looks like you&#39;re falling apart but when</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.600" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">you&#39;re walking through that you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.550" end="00:39:09.740" style="s2">of just going with the fella sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:11.750" style="s2">the rhythm and it may look like that for</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.740" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">you once you sort of finish your life</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.750" end="00:39:18.530" style="s2">and you look back on it and like okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:20.420" style="s2">some dots might connect but in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.530" end="00:39:25.460" style="s2">moment when you&#39;re in it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.420" end="00:39:28.820" style="s2">like a part yeah so just a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.460" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">levels of depth in there I will start</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.820" end="00:39:34.790" style="s2">with where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:37.130" style="s2">yes but we also have a tendency to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.790" end="00:39:40.280" style="s2">the outsider thinking we&#39;re following a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.130" end="00:39:43.960" style="s2">path right as we&#39;re walking so we can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.280" end="00:39:48.850" style="s2">can play that role in our own mind and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.960" end="00:39:48.850" style="s2">so now here&#39;s the curse the deep one</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.260" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2">there is no felt sense to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.930" end="00:39:59.000" style="s2">felt sense in the action is the felt</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:40:01.540" style="s2">sense in this step is the same it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.000" end="00:40:01.540" style="s2">gesture</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.010" end="00:40:11.850" style="s2">that you think the felt sense comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.480" end="00:40:15.780" style="s2">first and you follow it is the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.850" end="00:40:17.460" style="s2">framing much more subtle as that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.780" end="00:40:19.410" style="s2">looking at yourself and thinking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.460" end="00:40:26.750" style="s2">a path or someone&#39;s looking at yours</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.410" end="00:40:26.750" style="s2">thinking there&#39;s a path so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.840" end="00:40:37.530" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a deep fraying</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.070" end="00:40:39.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a very zoom in frame the others</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.530" end="00:40:41.910" style="s2">are zoom out frames right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.300" end="00:40:44.460" style="s2">walking and then you&#39;re retrospectively</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.910" end="00:40:45.150" style="s2">connecting the dots as if you can watch</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.460" end="00:40:48.600" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.150" end="00:40:50.010" style="s2">and make a story and or you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.600" end="00:40:52.200" style="s2">of a person doing that those are all</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.010" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">zoom out frames but if you look really</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.200" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">closely the felt sense and that gesture</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:41:02.600" style="s2">are the are the same in this case a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:02.600" style="s2">gesture being the step metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.050" end="00:41:08.540" style="s2">now you get the sense of following</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.940" end="00:41:08.540" style="s2">what&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.790" end="00:41:27.900" style="s2">their share example please and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">me think of sometimes when I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.900" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">write something and I&#39;m thinking okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:34.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to write this thing I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:37.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is I haven&#39;t got my</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.050" end="00:41:38.910" style="s2">book out yet um and I never never get to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.500" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">it but then I&#39;m like okay but just get</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.910" end="00:41:42.420" style="s2">my book out and I&#39;m just just go and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:44.910" style="s2">then it starts start flowing when I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.420" end="00:41:46.470" style="s2">that process then I know if you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.910" end="00:41:48.060" style="s2">like looking from the outside thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.470" end="00:41:50.250" style="s2">and trying to put out this path whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.060" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">thing I&#39;m gonna write then it just</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.250" end="00:41:56.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really yeah it doesn&#39;t emotion</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:59.400" style="s2">yeah and again we started by saying you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.670" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">know what is what is a useful zoom to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.400" end="00:42:04.170" style="s2">in and uh same thing for me writing I</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:07.890" style="s2">have to go in and out all the time like</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.170" end="00:42:09.960" style="s2">tries to be crazy like throw enough rain</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.890" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">going here alright that&#39;s not work you</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.960" end="00:42:20.430" style="s2">know so there&#39;s some kind of constant</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:22.020" style="s2">dynamic but it is it is to notice not</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.430" end="00:42:24.210" style="s2">only that there are different frames but</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.020" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">that you can cultivate other other</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.210" end="00:42:38.420" style="s2">friends yeah we&#39;re on zoom huh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:38.420" style="s2">interesting yeah I hear you there</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.240" end="00:42:45.290" style="s2">you know I worked for a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.130" end="00:42:49.070" style="s2">landscape design build and the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.290" end="00:42:50.780" style="s2">being having a systemic mind and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.070" end="00:42:52.820" style="s2">when the resources here on this day and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.780" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">just then we can bring the crane in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.820" end="00:43:02.030" style="s2">you know this was like coordinating all</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:10.369" style="s2">that dynamically was fun and and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.030" end="00:43:11.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a certain frame but some people</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.369" end="00:43:13.790" style="s2">ran their companies and with Gantt</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.780" end="00:43:16.790" style="s2">charts and milestones and they were too</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.790" end="00:43:18.470" style="s2">locked in inflexible so this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.790" end="00:43:23.240" style="s2">complicated their stuff so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.470" end="00:43:25.880" style="s2">always so this is like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.240" end="00:43:28.220" style="s2">investigating how this thing works and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.880" end="00:43:31.160" style="s2">part of this is this notion of framing</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.220" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">and zooming and tension between</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.160" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">potential tension between knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:55.310" style="s2">believing yeah those are you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:59.660" style="s2">integral theory we can map it out this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.310" end="00:44:01.850" style="s2">way so all the perspectives the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.660" end="00:44:04.609" style="s2">perspectives can live all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.850" end="00:44:07.820" style="s2">perspectives can live in one frame right</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.609" end="00:44:11.090" style="s2">so you can have as you could zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.820" end="00:44:14.330" style="s2">and have a first second or third person</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.090" end="00:44:17.660" style="s2">perspective from that vantage point well</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.330" end="00:44:24.340" style="s2">then you can zoom in sometimes when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.660" end="00:44:24.340" style="s2">zoom very very far in the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.850" end="00:44:30.790" style="s2">dimension can get smaller there I subtle</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.320" end="00:44:37.000" style="s2">but this is a different this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.670" end="00:44:40.760" style="s2">depth the zoom dimension to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.000" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">perspectival map so more of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.760" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">metacognitive function</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.579" end="00:44:52.420" style="s2">okay if you don&#39;t follow the felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.259" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">what is the appropriate relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.420" end="00:45:01.259" style="s2">it that&#39;s an appropriate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:04.359" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re just reconstructing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.259" end="00:45:07.450" style="s2">there may be a little gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.359" end="00:45:09.490" style="s2">felt sense and what you do or they may</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.450" end="00:45:11.410" style="s2">not be in the fact that you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.490" end="00:45:14.230" style="s2">languaging that way you think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.410" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">gap but if you look really closely and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.230" end="00:45:18.460" style="s2">you work with this the gap the subtler</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:21.519" style="s2">and subtler distance between the fallow</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.460" end="00:45:25.960" style="s2">and the felt sense you will get very</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.519" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">close to like spontaneous action or</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.960" end="00:45:37.420" style="s2">something so it&#39;s just it&#39;s just dialing</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.210" end="00:45:45.759" style="s2">into em when there&#39;s no gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.420" end="00:45:49.180" style="s2">felt sense in the and the gesture I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.759" end="00:45:51.460" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna fall out like I&#39;m Aiman</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.180" end="00:45:56.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to try and do the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.460" end="00:46:03.849" style="s2">now just because you you started off</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.200" end="00:46:06.849" style="s2">asking the question like of or saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.849" end="00:46:13.809" style="s2">that we&#39;ve come to know the teachings</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.849" end="00:46:16.059" style="s2">without believing them and and that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.809" end="00:46:21.700" style="s2">have to the first step is to just be</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.059" end="00:46:24.460" style="s2">with what it is that we believe and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.700" end="00:46:26.619" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if this felt sense the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.460" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">airtime that is actually kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.619" end="00:46:32.230" style="s2">it&#39;s connected to that believing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:35.230" style="s2">like and it it&#39;s that thing that wants</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.230" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">to move somewhere and so if you don&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.230" end="00:46:43.690" style="s2">you can&#39;t even be with it then we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.480" end="00:46:47.109" style="s2">sense our own movement yeah so that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.690" end="00:46:52.539" style="s2">the felt sense is in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.109" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">what you actually believe but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.539" end="00:46:57.160" style="s2">an easier way to that I mean for real</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:47:01.329" style="s2">subtle stuff yes but another way to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.160" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">that is what does your body do does your</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.329" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">body do that&#39;s what you really believe</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.289" end="00:47:22.900" style="s2">at that level so you can believe all</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.130" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">kinds of crazy things in the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.900" end="00:47:29.140" style="s2">world or I would say no that&#39;s how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:36.190" style="s2">using that but your body doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.140" end="00:47:39.039" style="s2">acquiesce to those those truths and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.190" end="00:47:40.269" style="s2">actually one could say this is just</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.039" end="00:47:45.880" style="s2">throwing it out there that the gap</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.269" end="00:47:54.910" style="s2">between what you believe and what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.880" end="00:47:56.410" style="s2">think is suffering can you expand them</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.910" end="00:48:01.150" style="s2">that if that was obviously very</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.410" end="00:48:03.240" style="s2">interesting yeah so your body lives in</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.150" end="00:48:05.950" style="s2">the real world</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.240" end="00:48:08.500" style="s2">whatever that means just very I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.950" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">mean it in a big-deal way you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.500" end="00:48:12.730" style="s2">like you have to eat you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:18.970" style="s2">you fall down something happens there</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.730" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">there are single-loop consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.970" end="00:48:31.589" style="s2">if you think otherwise and you act by</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:39.369" style="s2">those other thoughts you will suffer</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.589" end="00:48:41.109" style="s2">like most people well now we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.369" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">with the words think and believe I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.109" end="00:48:44.650" style="s2">we understand how we talk we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.890" style="s2">about it like the body kind of believes</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.650" end="00:48:54.599" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna die the body believes it gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.890" end="00:48:58.769" style="s2">old we often call it and thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.599" end="00:48:58.769" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with that so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.520" end="00:49:13.710" style="s2">but in that framing it almost feels like</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.240" end="00:49:13.710" style="s2">we are almost slaves to the body</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.550" end="00:49:47.640" style="s2">Beneatha are you are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.119" end="00:49:55.950" style="s2">Katherine&#39;s bio motive framework you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.140" end="00:50:00.430" style="s2">know I still haven&#39;t Daniel Thorsen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.950" end="00:50:02.380" style="s2">watch party and I know that though they</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.430" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">were kind of like talking about its</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.380" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">usefulness and I haven&#39;t looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.690" end="00:50:13.829" style="s2">but that came on my radar just last week</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:19.270" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s he&#39;s on today I think and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.829" end="00:50:23.500" style="s2">doing an intro to it and he yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.270" end="00:50:26.290" style="s2">talks about the the animal kind of body</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.500" end="00:50:28.390" style="s2">brain yeah intellectual brain and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.290" end="00:50:31.210" style="s2">the emotional brain and how they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.390" end="00:50:32.650" style="s2">talk to each other very well because</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.210" end="00:50:36.819" style="s2">they developed at different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.650" end="00:50:38.710" style="s2">evolution and then the week we were</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.819" end="00:50:42.280" style="s2">meeting to kind of get them talking to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.710" end="00:50:44.250" style="s2">each other and this feels what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.280" end="00:50:53.319" style="s2">talking about it feels really like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.250" end="00:50:56.049" style="s2">it&#39;s touching in with yeah because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.319" end="00:50:57.190" style="s2">but what&#39;s interesting just to bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.049" end="00:50:59.559" style="s2">that in you know what was very</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.190" end="00:51:02.339" style="s2">interesting with Daniel is what people</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.559" end="00:51:06.670" style="s2">very you know he made the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.339" end="00:51:08.380" style="s2">like you know it goes away for 75 days</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.670" end="00:51:10.780" style="s2">in the cabin it&#39;s not that extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.380" end="00:51:15.010" style="s2">but we are all very but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.780" end="00:51:17.170" style="s2">timing because of coronavirus right</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.010" end="00:51:19.090" style="s2">and he comes out and one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.170" end="00:51:21.100" style="s2">thing he said is this relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.090" end="00:51:23.230" style="s2">the body was completely changed</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.100" end="00:51:26.500" style="s2">he I mean we had I think before he went</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.230" end="00:51:28.810" style="s2">in you could say this subtle framing</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.500" end="00:51:30.790" style="s2">that were enslaved by the body and he</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.810" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">comes out and he realizes that all</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.790" end="00:51:38.350" style="s2">pleasure all joy all perception like it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:40.690" style="s2">comes from the body there&#39;s a big mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.350" end="00:51:45.630" style="s2"> that that&#39;s one of the framing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.690" end="00:51:45.630" style="s2">we have subtly you know like suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.540" end="00:51:56.740" style="s2">yeah the mind has convinced you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.040" end="00:51:59.430" style="s2">immortal and so it blames the body for</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.740" end="00:51:59.430" style="s2">containing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.930" end="00:52:54.450" style="s2">it&#39;s the primary act of violence your</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.520" end="00:53:06.350" style="s2">body has an existential precarity which</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.450" end="00:53:06.350" style="s2">means you do and so does everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.290" end="00:53:20.850" style="s2">um I just thought I would share an</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.270" end="00:53:26.100" style="s2">anecdote that I think is funny and kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.850" end="00:53:30.690" style="s2">of ties into the conversation I during</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.100" end="00:53:34.650" style="s2">this call like experienced a big wave of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.690" end="00:53:36.150" style="s2">nausea from a type of medication that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.650" end="00:53:37.740" style="s2">don&#39;t always have to take and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.150" end="00:53:40.080" style="s2">I take it wrong and I took it wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.740" end="00:53:43.290" style="s2">so I got this big wave of nausea and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.080" end="00:53:45.630" style="s2">was just very funny so you have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.290" end="00:53:47.310" style="s2">off my camera and like kind of tune out</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.630" end="00:53:48.869" style="s2">of the conversation a little bit and be</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.310" end="00:53:52.859" style="s2">like yeah well actually I have a body</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.869" end="00:53:55.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s precarious and I have to attend</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.859" end="00:53:57.450" style="s2">to it and I can&#39;t be fully in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.290" end="00:54:00.390" style="s2">space and I just thought it was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.450" end="00:54:01.770" style="s2">I can&#39;t maybe hear everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.390" end="00:54:07.350" style="s2">being said but I think I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.770" end="00:54:09.510" style="s2">transmission going it&#39;s really practical</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.350" end="00:54:13.710" style="s2">in education you know we teach children</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.510" end="00:54:15.840" style="s2">as if you know as Zack Stein is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.710" end="00:54:20.150" style="s2">good at analyzing it as if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.840" end="00:54:28.440" style="s2">designing Minds the body is completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.150" end="00:54:30.930" style="s2">shackled and the things that yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.440" end="00:54:33.740" style="s2">we actually you know that&#39;s the signal</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.930" end="00:54:33.740" style="s2">that were given</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.890" end="00:55:07.070" style="s2">it&#39;s just uh it&#39;s just how we are as</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.100" end="00:55:11.150" style="s2">moderns I guess okay so I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.070" end="00:55:16.790" style="s2">will end can i end with one more poem so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.150" end="00:55:20.090" style="s2">this poem is a poem about how we order</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.790" end="00:55:22.100" style="s2">things like we implicitly we know like</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.090" end="00:55:23.960" style="s2">how we judge things and our biases and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.100" end="00:55:27.080" style="s2">Prejudice but we&#39;re talking about deeper</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.960" end="00:55:30.190" style="s2">metacognitive patterns and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.080" end="00:55:33.590" style="s2">always ordering things in our head</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.190" end="00:55:37.250" style="s2">despite the perceptual evidence to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.590" end="00:55:42.650" style="s2">contrary and it&#39;s kind of a so lighter</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.250" end="00:55:45.890" style="s2">poem but it was written after an</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.650" end="00:55:52.850" style="s2">experience I had watching the snapping</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.890" end="00:55:56.630" style="s2">turtle eat a duck so that&#39;s most of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.850" end="00:56:01.270" style="s2">these are prompted by actual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.630" end="00:56:06.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve had so I saw a snapping turtle</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.270" end="00:56:11.890" style="s2">snatch a duck in the water pulled her</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.530" end="00:56:17.390" style="s2">down down down to her turtles lair and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.890" end="00:56:21.740" style="s2">devoured her this upset the order of</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.390" end="00:56:27.410" style="s2">things in my head the reptile who</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.740" end="00:56:29.330" style="s2">catches birds is a Jurassic creature yet</p>
