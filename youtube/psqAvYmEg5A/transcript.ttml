<p begin="00:00:04.020" end="00:00:10.950" style="s2">watching as you&#39;re sharing I experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.319" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">a really fun kind of visceral pain of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:15.420" style="s2">both excitement that these messages are</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:17.070" style="s2">being shared and like almost a relief</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.420" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">about that and the places where I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.070" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">can&#39;t wait for us to get to dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:24.180" style="s2">deeper without it and our dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">about the nature of second person has</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">been really fun and juicy so far and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">looking forward to the continued ones</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">that we get to do but the points that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">wanna just kind of emphasize that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">shared the I just think are so</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">meaningful is the very first few lines</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">that you shared was that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">a map that is tying our personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">resolution and our collective evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">the becoming a future human in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">developing the future of humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">that those two things are more</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">intimately tied than they ever were</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">before because we don&#39;t just affect and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:01.109" style="s2">are affected by our local tribe or our</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">country or our globalization is such</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:06.030" style="s2">that there there is no such places away</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">right we we can&#39;t leave Britain then</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.030" end="00:01:10.650" style="s2">come somewhere else to start over we</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">can&#39;t kick the British out of India we</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a climate change ocean</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">acidification they&#39;re all global issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">and so we also can&#39;t just tend to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">ourselves and do our part and say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">good because there&#39;s existential threats</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">from what any of us are doing right so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">we have to really take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2">for the whole thing for our part of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">but for the whole thing and to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">get that all the issues are global and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">that we have a part to play in all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">that and how how unavoidably connected</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">our personal lives and all of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">are such a critical women yeah totally I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">mean in some sense you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:53.570" style="s2">the process of evolution is to transcend</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">all dualities all splits and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.570" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">externalize interiors and that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">like a kind of kind of fancy phrase</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">exactly very clear again second</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">simplicity mmm-hmm so for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">great traditions they would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">something like to borrow from one</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">tradition from Hebrew mysticism Mala</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">Mala mouhot which is generally</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">translated as know that which is above</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">you and they retranslated it as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:18.960" style="s2">the second person know that which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">above mean hock comes from you that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.960" end="00:02:24.180" style="s2">affect the entire thing but that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">actually even 500 years ago was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.180" end="00:02:28.710" style="s2">only a realization of the eye of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">spirit right yet that wasn&#39;t verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.710" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">right that was a kind of it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">realization wasn&#39;t a Dogma it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">realization of the eye of the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">that I&#39;m affecting the whole thing but</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">now right that very esoteric elite</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.750" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">realization for only the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">enlightened ones is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:47.460" style="s2">externalized right and the best sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:48.990" style="s2">externalized</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.460" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">and actually every human being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.990" end="00:02:53.460" style="s2">actually awake realizes that actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">Google Earth what I do actually can</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.460" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">affect the entire thing and that which</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:03:00.360" style="s2">was only available to an elite in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:03.450" style="s2">democratization of knowledge and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.360" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">actually know that it&#39;s true but as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">interiors actually get exteriorized so</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s this fascinating moment right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:12.660" style="s2">that deep esoteric knowledge that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">human being and humanity we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.660" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">inextricably interwoven is now obvious</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">it&#39;s self-evident exactly and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:23.520" style="s2">something to see how this relates</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">because I have felt that the creative</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.520" end="00:03:29.670" style="s2">process the source of creation God going</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">through the entire labor of creation</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.670" end="00:03:34.350" style="s2">right that ends up with you and me</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">sitting here has a real vested interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.350" end="00:03:42.210" style="s2">in us creating not only am I asking of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:46.200" style="s2">that in what I need but that force is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.210" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">asking of me needs me yes and one day I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.200" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">was thinking thanking God thank you God</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">thank you got it and I heard this little</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:56.850" style="s2">voice it Thank You Barbara right it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">somewhat of a shock but of course if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.850" end="00:04:01.650" style="s2">divine force of creation is creating us</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">in order for us to be an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.650" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">that creative intelligence when we say</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">yes right I really feel I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">where that fits in the non-dual are they</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:15.810" style="s2">the true self is that the the God force</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:17.700" style="s2">itself is yearning for us to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.810" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">forward oh my god I mean oh my god I</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">absurdity of it right</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:41.159" style="s2">all these divine synchronicities over</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:44.490" style="s2">13.7 billion years work to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.159" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">Daniel but you I need you I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.490" end="00:04:47.639" style="s2">just got a shot amid the realization is</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.639" end="00:04:52.139" style="s2">everything so you get that we need and</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.139" end="00:04:57.030" style="s2">affected by right and that we all get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.449" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">recognize that more than we did before</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.030" end="00:05:01.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s also more true than it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">before both and the more true part is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.500" end="00:05:06.569" style="s2">part of what&#39;s so critical about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:08.909" style="s2">unique time which is the the increase of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.569" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">our technological capabilities extending</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.909" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">what we effect and the globalization of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">our technology is such that we really do</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">affect more more quickly more tangibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:19.889" style="s2">more meaningfully impactful moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.370" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">faster and and more powerfully I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.889" end="00:05:23.009" style="s2">exactly what Daniel just said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:26.159" style="s2">there&#39;s two things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.009" end="00:05:27.889" style="s2">right when we&#39;re aware of it we&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.159" end="00:05:30.300" style="s2">that there&#39;s this inner penetration</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.889" end="00:05:31.710" style="s2">right that&#39;s happening and that God</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.300" end="00:05:33.150" style="s2">needs us and we need God and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.710" end="00:05:34.830" style="s2">saying thank you to each other and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.150" end="00:05:37.259" style="s2">actually our co-creative partners and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.830" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">it&#39;s more true than it ever was before</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.330" end="00:05:57.719" style="s2">outdated thing is this just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">thing that gonee hasn&#39;t worked out from</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.310" end="00:06:08.819" style="s2">actually pathological evolution happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.270" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">when you transcend a previous level and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.819" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">exclude the level before it okay we got</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:17.639" style="s2">we&#39;re completely new right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:19.229" style="s2">pathological right organic right</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.639" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">evolution that produces something new</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.229" end="00:06:24.150" style="s2">and gorgeous transcendent includes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:27.300" style="s2">highest intuitions of what comes before</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.150" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">strips aside the distortions the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.300" end="00:06:32.009" style="s2">pathologies and takes the essence I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:34.740" style="s2">take some like Zen right Zen is half</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.009" end="00:06:36.839" style="s2">realization and half Japanese Imperial</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.740" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2"> right and you got a pension</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.839" end="00:06:41.100" style="s2">with a disentangle to to right and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:43.170" style="s2">this realization so</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.100" end="00:06:45.390" style="s2">when we go back to a sacred text we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.170" end="00:06:47.430" style="s2">actually accessing the divine spark and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.390" end="00:06:50.280" style="s2">we&#39;re taking responsibility for the god</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.430" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">voice that&#39;s powerful well I see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.280" end="00:06:54.600" style="s2">and I wanted to share with you an</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:57.450" style="s2">experience I had I was asking the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.600" end="00:06:59.790" style="s2">universe or the divine what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.450" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">person could actually guide all the new</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.790" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">powers of humanity right nanotech</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:08.040" style="s2">biotech quantum computing and these are</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:11.000" style="s2">powers that are radically new hmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:14.750" style="s2">had an experience of the risen Christ</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.000" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">now that made me go to the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.750" end="00:07:19.380" style="s2">right I come from a Jewish agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:22.440" style="s2">secular background and in the New</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.380" end="00:07:24.660" style="s2">Testament I discovered this person who</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.440" end="00:07:28.260" style="s2">was actually manifesting what we could</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.660" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">become and so the sacred text of the New</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.260" end="00:07:32.340" style="s2">Testament and certainly coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">Old Testament was a manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.340" end="00:07:38.100" style="s2">what&#39;s becoming and then when I was able</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.640" style="s2">to see the Christ as that which we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:44.120" style="s2">becoming I could internalize it and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.640" end="00:07:47.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t find any image in modern culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.120" end="00:07:50.010" style="s2">whatsoever so horrible to the risen</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.640" end="00:07:51.660" style="s2">Christ if you take it at all seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.010" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.660" end="00:07:57.660" style="s2">take it as real and we are else would i</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:08:00.930" style="s2">look in science fiction no and mythology</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:03.900" style="s2">no and he did it as a present so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.930" end="00:08:05.700" style="s2">an example absent absolutely a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.900" end="00:08:07.410" style="s2">text and I&#39;m asking you to write the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.700" end="00:08:09.720" style="s2">foreword to this because you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.410" end="00:08:11.730" style="s2">who would understand this is not only</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.720" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">going back because it&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.730" end="00:08:15.660" style="s2">taking there was something there that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:18.120" style="s2">takes us forward and me and Christ both</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.660" end="00:08:19.620" style="s2">started as Orthodox rabbis we both got</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.120" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">crucified a certain time and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.620" end="00:08:22.950" style="s2">resurrection is happening so we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:24.510" style="s2">let me let me just you know let me just</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.950" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">kind of just comment on it for a second</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.510" end="00:08:27.750" style="s2">so important then here Daniel and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.790" style="s2">this thing will be dialoguing about and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.750" end="00:08:32.460" style="s2">have a dialogue about let&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:35.160" style="s2">feel into this for a second so the risen</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.460" end="00:08:37.620" style="s2">Christ right Christ consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.160" end="00:08:39.390" style="s2">Christ consciousness is interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.620" end="00:08:41.729" style="s2">through my level of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.390" end="00:08:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why we say we&#39;d only wake up and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.729" end="00:08:46.590" style="s2">show up we grow up and grow up means</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.400" end="00:08:48.150" style="s2">psychological maturity and grow up means</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.590" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">to grow up to higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.150" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">consciousness so if I&#39;m egocentric and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">have an awakened experience I&#39;ve woken</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:56.970" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">and I think well I&#39;m god great because</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.970" end="00:09:00.779" style="s2">I&#39;m at an egocentric level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">consciousness if I actually grow up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.779" end="00:09:04.470" style="s2">an ethnocentric level of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.360" style="s2">have an awakening experience as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.470" end="00:09:07.890" style="s2">where the chosen people right which</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.360" end="00:09:09.630" style="s2">might be a Jewish move or a Tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.890" end="00:09:11.370" style="s2">Buddhist move or I mean you know or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.630" end="00:09:12.450" style="s2">Christian move lots of people have made</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.370" end="00:09:15.420" style="s2">that move no one owns it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.450" end="00:09:17.850" style="s2">means I wake up right but then my waking</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.420" end="00:09:20.250" style="s2">up my state experience of knowing true</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:22.649" style="s2">nature is interpreted through an</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.250" end="00:09:23.820" style="s2">ethnocentric prism which is why I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.649" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">right and therefore I think we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.820" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">chosen people and the shaman who wakes</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:29.579" style="s2">up goes in massacres the next tribe so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:32.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to wake up and I&#39;ve got to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.579" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">up now I&#39;m worldcentric so my risen</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:36.600" style="s2">Christ what is now a world centric cares</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:38.279" style="s2">for all of humanity as a social activist</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.600" end="00:09:40.110" style="s2">now in Cosmo Sentra</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.279" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">so my risen Christ is the personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.110" end="00:09:45.029" style="s2">basically evolutionary impulse yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.700" end="00:09:47.339" style="s2">so so there&#39;s three kind of if you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.029" end="00:09:49.649" style="s2">there&#39;s three divine forces that come</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.339" end="00:09:52.649" style="s2">together there&#39;s sacred text but as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.649" end="00:09:54.060" style="s2">living reified I think we promise not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.649" end="00:09:56.269" style="s2">use the word reified so I take it back</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.060" end="00:09:59.010" style="s2">but as a living kind of a living</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.269" end="00:10:01.170" style="s2">pregnant expression of a divine force</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.010" end="00:10:03.540" style="s2">sacred text then there&#39;s the reader of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.170" end="00:10:05.160" style="s2">the text Barbara right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.540" end="00:10:07.949" style="s2">the divine force third-person running</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.160" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">through reality so when God meets God</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.949" end="00:10:13.529" style="s2">right and has a threesome Barbara the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">sacred text and source and that text is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.529" end="00:10:18.269" style="s2">reinterpreted but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">the text is now no longer authentic the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.269" end="00:10:21.420" style="s2">text has always interpreted the text is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:24.199" style="s2">never not interpreted yeah so by</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.420" end="00:10:27.029" style="s2">actually claiming that text right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.199" end="00:10:28.410" style="s2">evolving the text something happens I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.029" end="00:10:30.269" style="s2">just give you one example then tens of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.410" end="00:10:31.320" style="s2">you Daniel thank you for this is so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.269" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">so so important it&#39;s not talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.320" end="00:10:36.269" style="s2">anyplace but in the spiritual scene</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">which is why these new movements and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.269" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">evolutionary movements are disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:41.370" style="s2">from the basic you know spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:42.750" style="s2">impetus of so many of the great</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">traditions and therefore become much</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.750" end="00:10:46.949" style="s2">less effective but let&#39;s give you one</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">example take the binding of issac famous</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.949" end="00:10:50.370" style="s2">biblical story Kierkegaard talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.860" style="s2">in his book fear of trembling you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.370" end="00:10:54.750" style="s2">father and son camping trip hey sound</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.860" end="00:10:56.190" style="s2">let&#39;s go for a camping trip oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.750" end="00:10:58.350" style="s2">going to a sacrifice here Oh where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.190" end="00:11:00.600" style="s2">where&#39;s the cow no cow what are we going</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.350" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">to sacrifice I think you okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.600" end="00:11:03.810" style="s2">story is read on the Jewish New Year of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">Rosh Hashanah kind of a traumatizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.810" end="00:11:07.170" style="s2">story that&#39;s why all Jews are either</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">therapists or in therapy because we read</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:12.790" style="s2">oh my god but if you actually read the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.090" end="00:11:15.490" style="s2">story more carefully you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.790" end="00:11:17.590" style="s2">actually Abraham himself in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.860" end="00:14:56.540" style="s2">as you said early on there&#39;s a great</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.439" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">really intentionally beautifully all</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.199" end="00:15:24.949" style="s2">no longer relevant parts and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.639" end="00:15:28.189" style="s2">reclaiming subjectivity as meaningful</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.150" end="00:15:48.360" style="s2">deep thing to say yes subjectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.010" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">real and important it also comes through</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.360" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">cognitive models so we have to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">these to be able to interpret this ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">more meaningfully so that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">meta thing that I get there that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:15:58.440" style="s2">important and the second part that goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:00.150" style="s2">with that is I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.440" end="00:16:02.820" style="s2">definitions of the emerging epic is</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.960" end="00:16:58.230" style="s2">worth pointing out when when daniel says</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.340" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">subjectivity what he means is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.230" end="00:17:02.340" style="s2">quality the interpersonal quality and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:04.470" style="s2">what he&#39;s pointing to is is that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.340" end="00:17:06.840" style="s2">subjectivity shouldn&#39;t be dismissed or</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.470" end="00:17:08.670" style="s2">disqualified and what mumford called a</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.670" end="00:17:12.810" style="s2">actually needs to be reclaimed however</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.830" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">we need to reclaim it at a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.810" end="00:17:18.030" style="s2">of consciousness because now we&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:18.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s mediated to the prisms of our</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.960" end="00:17:22.560" style="s2">cognitive biases that are at play so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:24.780" style="s2">need to actually clarify the lenses of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.560" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">perception and not make a regressive</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.090" end="00:17:53.390" style="s2">all relationship to the origin of</p>
