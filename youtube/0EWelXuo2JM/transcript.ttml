<p begin="00:00:33.050" end="00:00:39.829" style="s2">I think of all the stories that we&#39;ve investigated<br />so far, all the fundamental myths of creation</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.829" end="00:00:44.290" style="s2">that we&#39;ve investigated so far, the two that<br />we&#39;re going to talk about in detail today</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.290" end="00:00:48.850" style="s2">are probably the two stories that have had<br />more impact on the course of world history</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:50.470" style="s2">than any other two.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.470" end="00:00:54.871" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk in some detail today about<br />the story of creation laid out in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.871" end="00:00:58.940" style="s2">and also the story of the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.940" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">Both stories are also characterized by a kind<br />of depth that&#39;s virtually elimitless.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">And I think in some ways that the topics we&#39;re<br />going to discuss today are the most enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">of all the many ideas that we&#39;ve traveled<br />through so far in this series.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">So, we&#39;re gonna be concentrating on an analysis<br />of this schema again.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:31.030" style="s2">The idea being here of course that the world<br />of experience, which is the world that mythology</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.030" end="00:01:37.800" style="s2">is attempting to describe has these fundamental<br />constituent elements, one associated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.800" end="00:01:45.300" style="s2">chaos or nature or the unknown, one associated<br />with culture or the great father or the predictable.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.300" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">And another associated with the archetypical<br />son, the individual who&#39;s the offspring of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:57.979" style="s2">the interplay of these two fundamental forces<br />But given that part of the purpose of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.979" end="00:02:04.250" style="s2">series is to elucidate the causes of war and<br />motivation for war, attention paid to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.250" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">dualistic nature of the individual is of,<br />of paramount importance.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">So we could say that just as nature has it&#39;s<br />terrible side and just as culture has its</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">terrible side, so the individual has his or<br />her terrible side.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:24.690" style="s2">And the depth of that, capacity say for atrocity<br />and vengefulness is just as deep as the depth</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.690" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">of terror that the unknown itself holds.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">I think this is a difficult, a difficult fact<br />for normal individuals to grasp, given that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">we&#39;re highly motivated to view ourselves as,<br />if not precisely good, at least as relatively</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:41.879" style="s2">harmless.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.879" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">But the evidence that as individuals we are<br />relatively harmless is very, very thin indeed.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to understand<br />the depth of motivation for atrocity and social</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:02:59.780" style="s2">conflict without coming to terms with the<br />capacity for evil that&#39;s characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.780" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:05.720" style="s2">Now both the story in Genesis and the story<br />of the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment, lay bare in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.720" end="00:03:09.320" style="s2">many ways the nature of the structure of individual<br />evil.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.320" end="00:03:11.770" style="s2">And also not only it&#39;s structure, but its<br />motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.770" end="00:03:18.680" style="s2">Why it is that people would turn more or less<br />voluntarily away from the good and embrace</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.680" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">what can only be described as it&#39;s polar opposite.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.790" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">So in addition to making reference to this<br />structural schema of course, we&#39;re also going</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:37.160" style="s2">to be discussing it&#39;s, the typical mode of<br />interaction of these elements of experience.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.160" end="00:03:43.050" style="s2">You may note for example that this diagram<br />with which you&#39;re now very familiar, the notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.050" end="00:03:47.851" style="s2">of order, chaos and reestablishment of order<br />also parallels the structure of the story</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.851" end="00:03:52.690" style="s2">in Genesis, the creation where human beings<br />are created first and exist in a paradisal</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.690" end="00:03:53.690" style="s2">state.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.690" end="00:04:01.210" style="s2">That that paradise is disrupted as, as a consequence<br />of some, some event of virtually cosmic significance,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.210" end="00:04:06.680" style="s2">that as a consequence of that disruption people<br />are destined to live a profane existence in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">constant wait for the next state of order.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">So just as this is a fundamental archetypical<br />structure so that fundamental archetypical</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">structure is, constitutes the, the basic grammar<br />for this story in Genesis.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">Now what we&#39;re gonna do to begin with is to<br />describe precisely how this idea of paradise,</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">descent and the search for paradise is illustrated<br />symbolically in Genesis and exactly what those</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">symbolic representations mean.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">The idea here being that the reason that the<br />authors of Genesis, the multiple authors of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:52.270" style="s2">Genesis extending over thousands and thousands<br />of years chose those symbols as not because</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.270" end="00:04:58.249" style="s2">they were labouring to be obscure or not because<br />they were establishing a pre-empirical representation</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.249" end="00:05:04.849" style="s2">of reality, a kind of quasi scientific representation,<br />but because these symbols have an elusive</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.849" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">or metaphorical richness that enables a story,<br />although short to be characterized by an almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:11.629" style="s2">infinite depth.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.629" end="00:05:12.629" style="s2">That&#39;s part of the reason.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.629" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">The other part of the reason is that when<br />you say something profound, you say it using</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:20.669" style="s2">the language, the clearest language that you<br />have access to.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.669" end="00:05:26.650" style="s2">And if the story is almost unutterably profound,<br />then the images in which it is enshrouded</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.650" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">are almost incomprehensibly complex.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:37.521" style="s2">It has to be that way because if the target<br />of the investigation is reality itself, something</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.521" end="00:05:43.409" style="s2">so complex that we cannot conceptualize it<br />fully, then the language that we use to represent</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.409" end="00:05:47.099" style="s2">that reality has to stretch us to the limits<br />of our ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.099" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">and it is the case that the story in Genesis<br />say as much as the stories of Buddhist enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">constitutes an artistic endeavor on the part<br />of the human race to portray the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">human reality and to explain the behavioural<br />and philosophical consequences of that reality.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:10.539" style="s2">That being a tall order perhaps we should<br />forgive the multiple authors for only being</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.539" end="00:06:16.380" style="s2">able to manage it in a way that&#39;s essentially<br />imagistic and dramatic, rather than explicit,</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.380" end="00:06:20.279" style="s2">logical, philosophical and fully developed.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.279" end="00:06:26.910" style="s2">So the first thing I&#39;d like to point out to<br />you is to, is a statement made by Eliade,</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.910" end="00:06:30.490" style="s2">which I think is one of the most enlightening<br />things I ever read.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.490" end="00:06:35.930" style="s2">Now, the first thing that Eliade does is describe<br />the universality of flood mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.930" end="00:06:37.900" style="s2">But then he puts a twist on it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.900" end="00:06:46.159" style="s2">So the idea behind flood mythology is something<br />like this, if societies deviate from an emergent,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.159" end="00:06:50.689" style="s2">a necessarily emergent kind of morality, a<br />kind of morality that takes the viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.689" end="00:06:55.029" style="s2">of all the inhabitants of a given society<br />into account, if a society deviates from that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.029" end="00:06:58.780" style="s2">viewpoint sufficiently, it dooms itself to<br />annihilation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.780" end="00:07:05.569" style="s2">That annihilation being represented mythologically<br />as the flooding of the society by the precosmogonic</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.569" end="00:07:08.629" style="s2">waters, the primordial element or chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.629" end="00:07:14.969" style="s2">So societies that are tyrannical doom themselves<br />to eradication by chaos, a simple equation.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.969" end="00:07:20.740" style="s2">But made more complicated by Eliade, his observation<br />that more than one factor plays a role in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.740" end="00:07:22.119" style="s2">the establishment of the tyranny.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.119" end="00:07:27.560" style="s2">On the one hand there&#39;s straight degeneration<br />of cultural presuppositions in that if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.560" end="00:07:34.210" style="s2">establish a state or a game, which has particular<br />rules, because the environment is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.210" end="00:07:38.300" style="s2">transforming itself, the rules by necessity<br />become out of date.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.300" end="00:07:43.509" style="s2">So merely as a consequence of the progression<br />of time, the presuppositions on which any</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.509" end="00:07:48.009" style="s2">state are founded tend to become less and<br />less relevant to the current environment.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.009" end="00:07:49.009" style="s2">Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.009" end="00:07:53.339" style="s2">So there’s this aging and senility merely<br />as a consequence of thermodynamic processes.</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.339" end="00:07:57.909" style="s2">But then Iliad also points out that there&#39;s<br />one additional factor which has to be attributed,</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.909" end="00:08:03.719" style="s2">not to society, but to the individuals that<br />make up that society, which is that the strictures</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.719" end="00:08:10.830" style="s2">and rules on which society was founded can<br />be constantly and carefully updated when necessary,</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.830" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">If all the individuals that make up that society<br />are perfectly willing to confront exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:21.289" style="s2">of emerging chaos in their own lives when<br />those exemplars emerge, which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.289" end="00:08:25.419" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to be guided in<br />your personality by the structures of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.419" end="00:08:26.419" style="s2">state.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.419" end="00:08:30.199" style="s2">But if you face something unknown that those<br />rules cannot handle, it&#39;s a moral necessity</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.199" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">and obligation on your part to face that emergent<br />anomaly forthrightly to solve it if you can,</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:40.440" style="s2">and then to communicate the consequences of<br />your solution to the rest of the members of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.440" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">your society.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">Now what Eliade points out is that the individual<br />who, who removes him or her self from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">responsibility of confronting their own anomaly<br />speeds the process by which the state decays.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">So the decay of the state and the possibility<br />for the emergence of chaos is an interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:03.100" style="s2">between the tenancy of the state to disorder,<br />the tendency of the state to, archaism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.100" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">senility merely as a consequence of change<br />and the voluntarily the voluntary unwillingness</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:13.759" style="s2">of the citizens that comprise that state to<br />face the unknown courageously when it confronts</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.759" end="00:09:14.759" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.759" end="00:09:18.389" style="s2">So Eliade says: that the deluge myth, deluge<br />myth is almost universally disseminated.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.389" end="00:09:23.509" style="s2">It is documented in all the continents, although<br />very rarely in Africa probably because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.509" end="00:09:25.339" style="s2">the relative shortage of water.</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.339" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">And on various cultural levels.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">A certain number of variants seem to be the<br />result of dissemination, first from Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:32.920" style="s2">and then from India.</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.920" end="00:09:38.839" style="s2">It is equally possible that one or several<br />diluvial catastrophes gave rise to fabulous</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.839" end="00:09:43.319" style="s2">narratives, but it would be risky to explain<br />so widespread a myth by phenomena of which</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.319" end="00:09:44.723" style="s2">no geological traces have been found.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.723" end="00:09:49.829" style="s2">That majority of the flood myths seem in some<br />sense to form part of the cosmic rhythm.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.829" end="00:09:55.259" style="s2">The old world, people by a fallen humanity<br />is submerged under the water and sometime</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.259" end="00:09:58.149" style="s2">later a new world emerges from the aquatic<br />chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.149" end="00:10:03.470" style="s2">In a large number of variants the flood is<br />the result of the sins or ritual faults of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.470" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">Sometimes it results simply from the wish<br />of a divine being to put an end to mankind.</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:14.279" style="s2">The chief causes lie at once therefore in<br />the sins of men and the decrepitude of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.279" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">world.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">by the mere fact that it exists - That is,<br />that it lives and produces - The cosmos gradually</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:23.339" style="s2">deteriorates and ends by falling into decay.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.339" end="00:10:25.889" style="s2">This is the reason why it has to be recreated.</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.889" end="00:10:31.290" style="s2">In other words, the flood realizes on a macrocosmic<br />scale what is symbolically affected during</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.290" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">the New Year festival.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2">The end of the world and the end of a sinful<br />humanity in order to make a new creation possible.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:47.970" style="s2">So then the question might arise logically<br />enough, what is it that would motivate an</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.970" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">individual to work to avoid anomaly when it<br />emerges in his or her own life.</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:54.630" style="s2">And to risk an eventual flood.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.630" end="00:11:01.420" style="s2">And even more profoundly, what would motivate<br />an individual perhaps to work for the antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.420" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">of order, to work to promote the emergence<br />of chaos, since we know that people are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">ambivalent in their moral stance<br />Is it possible that we can create a compelling</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:20.750" style="s2">motivational story for the desire of the individual<br />as such to work against the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.750" end="00:11:23.730" style="s2">good rather than for it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:27.009" style="s2">So let&#39;s take a look at what Genesis says<br />about the creation of experience.</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.009" end="00:11:32.080" style="s2">So first of all, remember we&#39;re taking a phenomenological<br />stance on this story, which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.080" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">this story is not an objective retelling of,<br />of materialistic emergence.</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:41.510" style="s2">It’s something more specifically dramatic.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.510" end="00:11:44.050" style="s2">It describes the nature of human experience.</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.050" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">Okay?</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:46.529" style="s2">The nature of conscious human experience.</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.529" end="00:11:53.199" style="s2">And in fact the creation story of Genesis<br />lays explicit stress on individual consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.199" end="00:11:56.740" style="s2">literally as a precondition for being itself.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.740" end="00:12:01.699" style="s2">Which is to say that underlying the story<br />of Genesis is the notion that without whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.699" end="00:12:06.810" style="s2">consciousness is, there would be no segregated<br />entities and therefore no being.</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.810" end="00:12:12.740" style="s2">So this is one manner in which Genesis attempts<br />to put human beings at the centre of the cosmos,</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.740" end="00:12:18.920" style="s2">so to speak, which is the idea that the world<br />independently of consciousness, whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.920" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">world is absolutely needs to be reflected<br />by consciousness in order to exist in any</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.790" style="s2">sense that existence could reasonably be defined.</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.790" end="00:12:33.380" style="s2">First chapter:<br />&quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.380" end="00:12:34.380" style="s2">the earth.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.380" end="00:12:35.410" style="s2">And the earth was without form and void.</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.410" end="00:12:37.670" style="s2">And darkness was on the face of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">Now, the idea that the earth was without form<br />and void takes us back to the [13:48:55] Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:48.889" style="s2">creation myth and because the word for void,<br />the Hebrew word for void is “Tehom”.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.889" end="00:12:52.430" style="s2">And “Tehom” is a word derived from Timat.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.430" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">And the void, the chaos that constitutes the<br />unformed condition of the cosmos prior to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.660" end="00:13:04.889" style="s2">the elaboration of being is assimilated to<br />the same category as Timat, which is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.889" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">terrible unformed and frightening aprioric<br />condition that has to be courageously confronted</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:13.570" style="s2">in order to manifest itself as being.</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.570" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">&quot;And the earth was without form and void and<br />darkness was on the face of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.450" end="00:13:23.310" style="s2">So now you see another, another interplay<br />of opposites here between matter and water,</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.310" end="00:13:24.620" style="s2">the primordial elements.</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.620" end="00:13:26.300" style="s2">So first of all it&#39;s heaven and earth.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.300" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">And then it&#39;s earth and water and, and the<br />height and the deep.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.420" end="00:13:33.620" style="s2">And the spirit of God moved upon the face<br />of the water.</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.620" end="00:13:39.639" style="s2">So another opposite: that interaction between<br />spirit and whatever it is that the precosmogonic</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.639" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">water or chaos constitutes.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:44.779" style="s2">&quot;And God said let there be light.</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.779" end="00:13:45.779" style="s2">And there was light.</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.779" end="00:13:47.420" style="s2">And God saw the light, that it was good.</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.420" end="00:13:49.369" style="s2">And God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.369" end="00:13:50.369" style="s2">&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.369" end="00:13:54.389" style="s2">And then a prototypical division between light,<br />which is associated with illumination and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.389" end="00:13:58.779" style="s2">enlightenment and consciousness because we&#39;re<br />conscious during the day.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.779" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">And the sun and life that emerges nested inside<br />this, the initial opening lines of this sentence.</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.470" end="00:14:13.060" style="s2">Northrop Frye notes that there&#39;s tremendous<br />emphasis on the notion of a repetitive cycling</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.060" end="00:14:18.389" style="s2">of days and nights in the opening sentences<br />of Genesis, even though from a formal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.389" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">this emphasis is paradoxical because the notion<br />of the day emerges before the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:25.240" style="s2">the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.240" end="00:14:29.560" style="s2">And Fry&#39;s point is not that this is some careless<br />gesture on the part of the people who authored</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.560" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">Genesis.</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">But more that it&#39;s an attempt to emphasize<br />the idea of a cyclical relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:41.620" style="s2">consciousness and light and darkness and chaos<br />and to highlight the idea that this cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.620" end="00:14:46.750" style="s2">relationship is somehow absolutely vital to<br />being itself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.750" end="00:14:52.569" style="s2">So Genesis one five says &quot;and God called the<br />light day and the darkness he called night.</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.569" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">And the evening and the morning were the first<br />day &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">Frye says &quot;... the central metaphor underlying<br />beginning is not really birth at all.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:02.009" style="s2">It is rather the moment of waking from sleep.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.009" end="00:15:07.990" style="s2">When one world disappears, a world of virtuality<br />and potential, and another comes into actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.990" end="00:15:08.990" style="s2">being.</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.990" end="00:15:10.899" style="s2">This is still contained within a cycle.</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.899" end="00:15:14.459" style="s2">We know that at the end of the day we shall<br />return to the world of sleep...&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.459" end="00:15:19.449" style="s2">and that&#39;s a notion that has a metaphorical<br />resonance because there&#39;s the sleep that punctuates</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.449" end="00:15:20.449" style="s2">periods of consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.449" end="00:15:25.139" style="s2">And then there&#39;s the great sleep at the end<br />of life, which is characterized by the complete</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.139" end="00:15:27.870" style="s2">cessation of consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.870" end="00:15:30.990" style="s2">We know that at the end of the day we shall<br />return to the world of sleep.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.990" end="00:15:35.889" style="s2">But in the meantime there&#39;s a sense of self-transcendence<br />of a consciousness getting up from an unreal</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.889" end="00:15:38.760" style="s2">into a real or at least more real world.</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.760" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">This sense of awakening into a greater degree<br />of reality is expressed by Haraclitis as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.860" end="00:15:49.019" style="s2">passing from a world where everyone has his<br />own logos, into a world where there&#39;s a common</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.019" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">logos - experience that we all share.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:57.589" style="s2">&quot;Genesis presents the creation as a sudden<br />coming into being of a world through articulate</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.589" end="00:16:04.410" style="s2">speech, which is another aspect of logos&quot;logos<br />incorporates the idea of creative exploration,</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.410" end="00:16:09.410" style="s2">And then the formulation of the consequences<br />of that exploration in verbally communicable</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.410" end="00:16:10.730" style="s2">categories<br />Right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.730" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">Which give our, give our aspects of our being<br />their defined boundaries and parameters and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.470" end="00:16:22.350" style="s2">enable us to establish a shared mode of social<br />being- through articulate speech conscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.350" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">perception light and stability.</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">Something like this metaphor of awakening<br />may be the real reason for the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">days and such recurring phrases.</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:33.379" style="s2">&quot;And the evening and the morning were the<br />first day&quot;, even before the day as we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.379" end="00:16:41.889" style="s2">it was established with the creating of the<br />sun</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.889" end="00:16:48.110" style="s2">The most fundamental pair of conflicting and<br />cyclically interacting pairs of opposites</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.110" end="00:16:55.379" style="s2">that is portrayed in Genesis is essentially<br />the pairing of chaos versus order, chaos versus</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.379" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">generative order.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:02.149" style="s2">And a poem by F.I Tiuitchev expresses this<br />idea extremely well and very powerfully.</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.149" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to read it to you.</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">When sacred night sweeps heavenward she takes<br />the glad the winsome day.</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:12.059" style="s2">Unfolding it,<br />rolls up it&#39;s golden carpet that had been</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.059" end="00:17:14.930" style="s2">spread over an abysmal pit.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.930" end="00:17:17.320" style="s2">Gone vision like as the external world.</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.320" end="00:17:22.370" style="s2">And man a homeless orphan has to face<br />in utter helplessness naked, alone</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.370" end="00:17:24.670" style="s2">the blackness of immeasurable space.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.670" end="00:17:31.080" style="s2">Upon himself he has to lean with mind<br />abolished, thought unfathered in the dim</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:33.059" style="s2">depths of his soul he sinks.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.059" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">For nothing comes<br />from outside to support or limit him.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:41.740" style="s2">All life and brightness seem an ancient dream<br />while in the substance of the night</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.740" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">unraveled, alien, he now perceives<br />a faithful something that is his by right.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.310" style="s2">Um, absolutely brilliant poetic statement,<br />I think.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.310" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">Laying out very nicely, very richly the, the<br />fundamental nature of the existential paradox</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">that constitutes human life.</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">Pointing to a very profound sense of futility<br />and fear.</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:08.860" style="s2">But then beyond that to the notion that in<br />the depths of the unknown, in the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.860" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">the darkness and in the depths of all that,<br />that&#39;s fundamentally unfaceable, there still</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:20.910" style="s2">lurks something that can be discovered given<br />sufficient courage.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.910" end="00:18:27.500" style="s2">Another fundamental division portrayed indirectly<br />in Genesis, the word versus chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.500" end="00:18:32.420" style="s2">So what you have in genesis is an absolutely<br />stellar idea.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.420" end="00:18:38.530" style="s2">I think perhaps the most fundamental contribution<br />of archaic Jewish thinking to western and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.530" end="00:18:43.660" style="s2">world civilization, which is that although<br />it is easier in some ways to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.660" end="00:18:49.930" style="s2">actual matrix of things, their material substrate<br />as the strata from which they emerge, it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.930" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">equally reasonable and perhaps more pragmatically<br />useful to note that things only exist because</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:01.790" style="s2">of the interaction between the logos, the<br />word that characterizes consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.790" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">And whatever this matrix is.</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:09.040" style="s2">So in Jewish thought and then Christian thought,<br />and of course in thoughts of that sort echoed</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.040" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">throughout the world, there&#39;s the idea that<br />consciousness associated with the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:19.800" style="s2">directly associated with the deity is actually<br />the thing that in interaction with this matrix</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.800" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">give, gives rise to being.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">Genesis plays a stress, places stress on this<br />notion of the internal logos, the individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:31.790" style="s2">consciousness in two very complex ways.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.790" end="00:19:38.630" style="s2">It first says that it&#39;s the word of God, the<br />logos of God that gives, that gives order</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.630" end="00:19:40.700" style="s2">to chaos and makes being emerge.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.700" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">But then even more particularly it&#39;s the,<br />it’s the self-conscious logos of individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">humans, their capacity not just to see the<br />world as an object.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:57.400" style="s2">But also to see themselves as an object that<br />gives the world the particular value slant</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.400" end="00:19:58.460" style="s2">that it has for us.</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.460" end="00:20:03.940" style="s2">which is to say that not only are we in a<br />world where the subject and the object are</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">separated.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:09.710" style="s2">And, and therefore experience and suffer the<br />consequences of that separation-But even more</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.710" end="00:20:16.160" style="s2">particularly we are the only creatures who<br />are so conscious that we can observe ourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.160" end="00:20:17.160" style="s2">as objects.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.160" end="00:20:21.770" style="s2">And the consequence of that is that because<br />we&#39;ve extended our consciousness to ourself,</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.770" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">we&#39;re capable of conceptualizing things that<br />other creatures cannot conceptualize.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:31.610" style="s2">Such as the infinite possibility that lays<br />manifest of the unknown but also the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.610" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">that as individuals we&#39;re subject to our finite<br />limitations, right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">That we can become diseased.</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:40.810" style="s2">That we can become mentally ill.</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.810" end="00:20:42.840" style="s2">And that finally we&#39;ll die.</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.840" end="00:20:48.470" style="s2">And so the idea here is that something like<br />the extension of logos to the object, to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.470" end="00:20:55.990" style="s2">subject has made human existence finally problematic.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.990" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">And genesis refers to this as essentially<br />the heritable sin of Adam.</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:07.410" style="s2">Because we&#39;re aware of our own vulnerability<br />as a genetic consequence merely of being human.</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:13.410" style="s2">There&#39;s a transformation in the nature of<br />experience that has essentially cosmic significance.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.410" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">Lao Tzu in the Tao Te Ching makes a comment<br />on the formless chaos that constitutes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:27.430" style="s2">matrix of things, the origin of things in<br />the following manner.</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.430" end="00:21:33.390" style="s2">He says &quot;there was something formless yet<br />complete that existed before heaven and earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.390" end="00:21:35.570" style="s2">without sound, without substance.</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.570" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">&quot;<br />This is the void or the chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.930" style="s2">&quot;Dependent on nothing, unchanging all pervading.</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.930" end="00:21:41.930" style="s2">Unfailing.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.930" end="00:21:44.500" style="s2">One may think of it as the mother of all things<br />under heaven.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.500" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">The idea here being that whatever experience<br />is in the absence of a delimited human consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:54.110" style="s2">is something that’s outside the boundaries<br />of time.</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.110" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">Because time -temporality is a human attribute.</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:22:02.030" style="s2">And it&#39;s outside the boundaries of spatial<br />limitation because only human beings with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:08.750" style="s2">their delimited and fixed size can attribute<br />spatial aspects to being itself.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.750" end="00:22:15.040" style="s2">So whatever it is, is that exists without<br />us, is so comprehensive and so complete and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.040" end="00:22:21.650" style="s2">transcends temporal dimensions to such a great<br />degree that it can&#39;t be conceptualized as</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.650" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">being at all.</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:26.890" style="s2">It’s something that transcends being to<br />such a degree that it&#39;s not even nameable</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.890" end="00:22:32.090" style="s2">but still exists as &quot;the mother of all things<br />under heaven&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.090" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">Now Genesis formally associates the human<br />being with logos.</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:46.370" style="s2">And this is a determinative move in human<br />history just as the Mesopotamians first hypothesized</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.370" end="00:22:51.900" style="s2">that their emperor was equivalent to Marduk,<br />the force that confronted Timat and carved</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.900" end="00:22:57.080" style="s2">her into pieces and made the world, and just<br />as the Egyptians conceptualized their pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.080" end="00:23:03.450" style="s2">as the intermingling between Osiris, the stability<br />of the state and Horus the exploratory hero.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.450" end="00:23:09.160" style="s2">And then disseminated that identity down the<br />aristocratic levels, closer and closer to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">the individual, individual.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:18.670" style="s2">So the ancient Hebrews said, “and God said<br />let us make man in our image after our likeness.”</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.670" end="00:23:25.470" style="s2">Now, it could be said that the logical derivation<br />of that statement is that god looks like human</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.470" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">beings.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:28.700" style="s2">Or conversely that God is an old man with<br />a beard.</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.700" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">But it means something I think that&#39;s more<br />sophisticated than that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:38.350" style="s2">Which is that the central aspect that&#39;s associated<br />with this transcendent deity, the logos, which</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.350" end="00:23:43.680" style="s2">is the thing that gives rise to order as a<br />consequence of it&#39;s confrontation with chaos</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.680" end="00:23:47.560" style="s2">is also the thing that centrally characterizes<br />human consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.560" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">And so with that there&#39;s this transcendent<br />notion that inside each human being is a spark</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:55.460" style="s2">of genuine divinity.</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.460" end="00:24:00.500" style="s2">And it’s the manifestation of that divinity<br />in human temporal and spatial parameters that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.500" end="00:24:05.170" style="s2">literally keeps the cosmos generating.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.170" end="00:24:13.270" style="s2">&quot;So God created his, man in his own image<br />in the image of God created he, him.</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.270" end="00:24:18.260" style="s2">Male and female created he them and let them<br />have dominion over the fish of the sea and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.260" end="00:24:22.370" style="s2">the fowl of the air and over the cattle and<br />over all the earth and over every creeping</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.370" end="00:24:24.170" style="s2">thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.170" end="00:24:25.170" style="s2">&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.170" end="00:24:28.620" style="s2">Now fundamentalist Christians read this as<br />an injunction, right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.620" end="00:24:32.650" style="s2">This is what human beings should do, dominate<br />all other living things.</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.650" end="00:24:36.950" style="s2">But it&#39;s more like a description, which is<br />that the consequence of the embeddedness of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.950" end="00:24:42.100" style="s2">this spark of divinity in the individual is<br />precisely what gave rise to the human ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.100" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">to dominate the planet.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">Which is an ability that at least at the moment<br />seems fundamentally unparalleled, with no</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:50.270" style="s2">limit in sight.</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.270" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">So it&#39;s not an injunction so much as a cold-hearted<br />description.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:25:01.170" style="s2">There&#39;s a very profound idea underlying the<br />necessity of the creation of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.170" end="00:25:02.170" style="s2">human being.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.170" end="00:25:07.070" style="s2">Here&#39;s a line of archaic Jewish speculation<br />that runs something like this:</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.070" end="00:25:14.410" style="s2">Why is the creation of a limited subject necessary<br />if God&#39;s omniscient and omnipotent and omnipresent?</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.410" end="00:25:17.350" style="s2">Why would he bother creating anything outside<br />of himself?</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.350" end="00:25:20.170" style="s2">And the line of speculation runs like this.</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.170" end="00:25:26.950" style="s2">The one thing that a being that is complete<br />in all regards even all hypothetical regards</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:30.120" style="s2">lacks by necessity his limitation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.120" end="00:25:36.150" style="s2">And as a consequence of that anything that&#39;s<br />absolute is not complete and can&#39;t be complete</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.150" end="00:25:37.300" style="s2">without limitation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.300" end="00:25:40.571" style="s2">And so there&#39;s an emergent idea in Genesis.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.571" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">And most notions of the emergence of human<br />consciousness that the absolute needs the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:52.590" style="s2">reflection point of a delimited being to actually<br />spring into some kind of defined actuality.</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.590" end="00:25:58.190" style="s2">So that being itself becomes an interplay<br />between the necessary limitations of the finite</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.190" end="00:26:02.390" style="s2">and the transcendent reality of the absolute.</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.390" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">And so being is something that emerges because<br />of the fact as another ancient Jewish tradition</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:15.160" style="s2">has it, God and man are in a sense twins,<br />mutually dependent on one another for their</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.160" end="00:26:18.580" style="s2">defined being.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.580" end="00:26:22.650" style="s2">From such a perspective, being has the same<br />nature as a game.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.650" end="00:26:25.170" style="s2">When you&#39;re playing a game you have to play<br />by rules.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.170" end="00:26:29.480" style="s2">Which means that there are things that you<br />can do while playing the game.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.480" end="00:26:30.740" style="s2">But there are many, many things you can&#39;t<br />do.</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.740" end="00:26:34.840" style="s2">And that the game could not exist without<br />the limitations.</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.840" end="00:26:39.080" style="s2">Also predicated on the idea that the imposition,<br />the Nietzschian idea that the imposition of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.080" end="00:26:45.060" style="s2">limitations on a structure actually gives<br />rise to the possibility of diverse new forms.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.060" end="00:26:49.500" style="s2">Which is also a very sophisticated way of<br />conceptualizing the world.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.500" end="00:26:56.730" style="s2">So from the perspective of Genesis, the individual<br />is the locale of the experiential drama.</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.730" end="00:27:54.400" style="s2">And the fact that the individual is limited<br />is a necessary precondition for being.</p>
