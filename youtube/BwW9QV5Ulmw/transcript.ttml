<p begin="00:02:26.350" end="00:02:33.399" style="s2">That&#39;s the 2011 book and in particular has been quite controversial. So I thought we with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">Good. Thanks for having me you published explaining post-modernism in 2011 in the revised version</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.500" end="00:02:47.050" style="s2">How has it been selling first of all, what sort of reaction are you garnery?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:49.910" style="s2">Yeah sales have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.910" end="00:02:53.290" style="s2">Steady, which is gratifying for an academic book</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.290" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2">And then in the last I would say three to four years sales have picked up again. Just because</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.240" end="00:03:03.789" style="s2">Post-modernism has spilled out from being a primarily intellectual movement to a more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.610" end="00:03:09.940" style="s2">Cultural movement as a result of that I&#39;d say the reactions have been strongly polarized</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.209" end="00:03:16.779" style="s2">Particularly among philosophers the reactions tend to be positive as we talk with</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.750" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">intellectuals outside of the area of philosophy the reactions start to become more mixed to outright hostile and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.390" end="00:03:32.410" style="s2">Also interestingly among the broadly thinking public. There&#39;s been a lot of response to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.410" end="00:03:35.889" style="s2">So, uh that&#39;s been been gratified again. Of course, the reactions are</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:41.769" style="s2">Polarized because post-modernism is a very strong right vigorous movement. That makes some very</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:48.369" style="s2">audacious in my view destructive claims and then as we&#39;re seeing when they spill out into the cultural arena</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.549" end="00:03:51.789" style="s2">people realize the stakes are high and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.860" end="00:03:57.070" style="s2">We have the usual kinds of social media debates that we have a net. I&#39;m going to do something terrible here</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.860" end="00:04:16.779" style="s2">2016 so that&#39;ll be some small benefit to doing it. So</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.860" end="00:06:33.729" style="s2">I thought we might start by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:41.559" style="s2">Explaining post-modernism again your 2011 book skepticism and socialism from Rousseau difficoult</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:44.050" style="s2">Because I know that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:49.629" style="s2">Perhaps more controversial of late and it was when you originally published it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.390" end="00:06:55.419" style="s2">Absolutely, oh the sails and the academic and the public reaction</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.630" end="00:07:03.760" style="s2">Right. Well sales have been strong. The book was originally in 2004 installed sold steadily for the first decade or so</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.760" end="00:07:07.149" style="s2">Which is quite gratifying for for an academic book</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.570" end="00:07:11.830" style="s2">and then starting about three years ago in part because</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.350" end="00:07:18.040" style="s2">Post-modernism started to spill out of the strict in the academic intellectual world into the broader cultural world</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:22.270" style="s2">Sales picked up again, and there&#39;s been of a two-front</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.640" end="00:07:28.149" style="s2">Set of discussions one at the intellectual level and one of the more public thinking public level as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.480" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">Yet gratifyingly lots of translations. I think there will be three more translations added this year</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:40.089" style="s2">Arabic Hebrew and Estonian are in the works, so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.730" end="00:07:42.849" style="s2">All together I&#39;m pleased with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.550" end="00:07:51.219" style="s2">The the reactions are quite polarized in part because reactions to post-modernism itself are polarized. It&#39;s a it&#39;s an extreme movement as</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.950" end="00:07:58.839" style="s2">Good deep thinking should be even if I disagree fundamentally with post-modernism. It is a well articulated</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.320" end="00:08:07.029" style="s2">negative outlook on most of life&#39;s philosophical questions and so we should expect that any movement that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:09.140" style="s2">pushes buttons</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.140" end="00:08:11.140" style="s2">fundamentally like that should</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.240" end="00:08:15.730" style="s2">Get some extreme reactions the same thing holds when for me when I push back</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.280" end="00:08:20.470" style="s2">Against in my book some of these strong to my mind ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.260" end="00:08:27.249" style="s2">Nihilistic claims that post-modernism ends up making I also get the the negative pushback the pushback</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.740" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">Kind of comes in two forms. I&#39;ve found from the professional reviews</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">There have been H to my knowledge by professional philosophers in the philosophy journals</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">And they are generally strong to very strongly positive the normal scholarly quibbles arise</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:51.969" style="s2">When I get pushback for our sorry reviews from academics outside of the philosophy they tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.310" end="00:08:57.849" style="s2">polarized so I&#39;m strong in favor, but then particularly people in history in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.610" end="00:09:01.240" style="s2">sociology in in rhetoric studies and literature</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.150" end="00:09:08.199" style="s2">Places where there are stronger contingents of postmodern thinkers, I tend to get strongly negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.780" end="00:09:13.439" style="s2">Responses and those responses are also mirrored in the the general thinking public</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">When they respond and write back and write reviews maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">To bring people up to date</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.540" end="00:09:28.830" style="s2">For you to give us a brief overview of your view of post-modernism like a definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.830" end="00:09:31.619" style="s2">It&#39;s one of those tricky. Yeah, terms like</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:35.669" style="s2">Existentialism or phenomenology that are bandied about by people</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.550" end="00:09:38.849" style="s2">educating people on a fairly regular basis, but</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.370" end="00:09:44.159" style="s2">Right where where the definition itself is slippery and difficult to pin down</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.260" end="00:09:47.609" style="s2">So right talk a little bit about how you view</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">post-modernism and also</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:55.229" style="s2">What argument you made with regards to the history of its development, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.570" end="00:09:59.249" style="s2">Well, it makes sense that it&#39;s slippery in part because post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.950" end="00:10:01.950" style="s2">philosophically avoids</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.140" end="00:10:05.879" style="s2">Categorizations avoids broad sweeping statements, although they do make some</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:12.059" style="s2">So anytime you try to make a precise broad sweeping claim about what this?</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.550" end="00:10:19.620" style="s2">post-modernism amounts to you will get pushback on that but there is a broadly unifying set of themes -</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.020" end="00:10:22.770" style="s2">post-modernism if you start by breaking the term down its</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.620" end="00:10:31.260" style="s2">Post-modernism. So first you have to say what is modernism such that post-modernism is reacting against it or saying that we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.329" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">beyond and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.980" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">Modernism is used variously in different fields of modernism in art in literature. I&#39;m using a philosophical and historical</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:43.560" style="s2">understanding of post-modernism and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.050" end="00:10:48.599" style="s2">It&#39;s mostly used now. That is to say we look at the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.600" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">So that essentially is the last four to five hundred years of history at least in the in the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.970" end="00:10:59.790" style="s2">so what&#39;s going on in the world five hundred years ago is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.180" end="00:11:09.089" style="s2">revolutionary transformation of Western society we have Columbus crossing the ocean and so we&#39;re entering into a new era of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.540" end="00:11:15.269" style="s2">Globalization the Renaissance is in full swing and its impact</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:19.409" style="s2">Late 1400s early 1500s is now being felt all over</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:21.550" style="s2">Europe</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.550" end="00:11:27.830" style="s2">There is the Protestant Reformation and the Counter Reformation. So religious life in the West is being dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.860" end="00:11:33.650" style="s2">transformed you see the beginnings of science with thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.260" end="00:11:41.330" style="s2">Copernicus and thus alias in anatomy and so scientific method is being developed and all of the things that we now recognize as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.400" end="00:11:48.259" style="s2">Scientific disciplines are being founded. So that&#39;s the the modern world starting four or five hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.470" end="00:11:53.810" style="s2">philosophically, we start looking at the analyses that are being offered by thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.510" end="00:11:55.860" style="s2">Francis Bacon</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.860" end="00:11:59.690" style="s2">Rene Descartes and others and we see that they are putting</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.180" end="00:12:05.210" style="s2">Fought on a different foundation from that that had gone on earlier</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.589" end="00:12:09.589" style="s2">What happened with the modernists</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.410" end="00:12:12.950" style="s2">maybe if we tried to sum it up is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.190" end="00:12:17.989" style="s2">Seem to be this emerging consensus that the world was</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.510" end="00:12:19.529" style="s2">rationally</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.529" end="00:12:22.609" style="s2">Intelligible. Yes, and that human beings could</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:29.000" style="s2">explore both physically and mentally and also come to predict and control the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.180" end="00:12:31.730" style="s2">transformations of the material world</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.730" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">I mean it seems to me that that&#39;s the fundamental element of let&#39;s say the scientific and therefore also the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.760" end="00:12:42.799" style="s2">perspective but but also I think that what I went along with that was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.640" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">Progress</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:54.260" style="s2">genuine progress in knowledge was possible and along with that the benefits of progress both conceptually and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:13:00.649" style="s2">technologically and I mean it seems to me to be it seems to me to be fair to point out that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.489" style="s2">movement for substantive fruit</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.490" end="00:13:10.010" style="s2">I mean yes argue about the misery that the modernist movement caused along the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.589" end="00:13:14.299" style="s2">Say with regards to the advancement of military technology and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.300" end="00:13:22.250" style="s2">But it seems indisputable to me that the average human being is far better off now than he or she was</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.620" end="00:13:27.229" style="s2">Well, certainly 200 years ago and absolutely 500 years ago, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.230" end="00:13:32.750" style="s2">So this revolution in thought with the subsequent developments in science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.750" end="00:13:35.479" style="s2">We certainly can judge philosophies by their fruits</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.540" end="00:13:38.719" style="s2">And so we can then say yeah, absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.300" end="00:13:44.940" style="s2">We&#39;re live longer. We&#39;re living healthier were living less pain-free life were able to enjoy a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.820" end="00:13:48.659" style="s2">More art more leisure and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.660" end="00:13:52.380" style="s2">So all of the things that and again, this is a value judgment if you think those are all good things</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.050" end="00:13:59.010" style="s2">Then we&#39;re doing a whole lot better as a result of of that philosophy. No the other side though</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.010" end="00:14:02.489" style="s2">I want to emphasize here is that you emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.120" end="00:14:11.669" style="s2">That the world is rationally intelligible that along with modernism came the claim that it was rationally intelligible to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.070" end="00:14:18.510" style="s2">Individual rather than bear being an elect number of people who have special cognitive insights into the mysteries of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.730" end="00:14:21.269" style="s2">Or that there are certain authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.850" end="00:14:26.670" style="s2">institutions that are controlled by elites and only they are the ones who have</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.130" end="00:14:34.679" style="s2">cognitive and therefore social authority to make various pronouncements part and parcel of the rise of modernism is a broadly</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">Universalizing of that that each individual is born with the rational capacity and that with proper training education literacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:48.839" style="s2">And so forth they can come to understand the world for themselves. They can be self responsible</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.839" end="00:14:50.010" style="s2">They can take charge of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.010" end="00:14:55.229" style="s2">And as a result of that we should have an extension of Rights that used to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.510" end="00:14:58.469" style="s2">prerogatives only of the few an expansion of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.290" end="00:15:02.550" style="s2">You can do whatever you want with your life broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.860" end="00:15:10.349" style="s2">and so what we then see is that it&#39;s not only a religious elite or a political elite that is empowered but rather</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">Every human being and then we can see</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.779" end="00:15:17.099" style="s2">systematically over the course of the next century it gets extended to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.470" end="00:15:24.600" style="s2">not only males who own property but to all males and then to women and then to people of other ethnicities and other races as</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.970" end="00:15:27.930" style="s2">We push back against all of us. So we have this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:35.940" style="s2">Universal rights and universal self responsibility Universal freedom that I think also is part and parcel of the modern movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">Well the thing about science that makes it so peculiar. I think is that science is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.660" end="00:15:49.020" style="s2">Technology that enables people who are bright, but not that bright</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.270" end="00:15:55.650" style="s2">Let&#39;s say to genuinely produce advances in College because of the method</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:02.760" style="s2">Right meaning if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a careful scientist, look when we studied what predicted academic?</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.580" end="00:16:08.309" style="s2">achievement for example both in graduate school and among faculty members</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.640" end="00:16:14.369" style="s2">Creativity didn&#39;t even enter the equation that&#39;s interesting noted conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.590" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">But I think it&#39;s partly because with the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.430" end="00:16:23.280" style="s2">you can you can actually break down your knowledge seeking into a set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.800" end="00:16:24.850" style="s2">implementable</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.850" end="00:16:27.299" style="s2">technological steps and that enables it to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.150" end="00:16:34.350" style="s2">Implemented on an incredibly broad scale and even if a lot of it is Error error ridden</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.350" end="00:16:40.350" style="s2">which is obviously the case and and to a scandalous degree to some what lately it still means that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:45.179" style="s2">Hundreds of thousands of us and increasingly now millions of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.690" end="00:16:49.049" style="s2">Grind away slowly at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.050" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">careful technology of knowledge acquisition that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:57.059" style="s2">Overall, we do seem to be able to predict him to control the world better</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.160" end="00:17:04.349" style="s2">then that started to become question, you know, one of the things that seem to characterize post-modernism one definition that I&#39;ve read is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.110" end="00:17:06.790" style="s2">skepticism of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.790" end="00:17:11.759" style="s2">Meta-narratives, right? That&#39;s sorry. That&#39;s from Jean Francois leotard and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.730" end="00:17:17.940" style="s2">He is the one credited with labeling post-modernism philosophically, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.940" end="00:17:22.469" style="s2">So and defining it as a skepticism toward meta-narratives what that means</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.870" end="00:17:26.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things built into that one is of course the skepticism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.850" end="00:17:32.550" style="s2">Philosophy for the last century and a half or so has entered an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.340" end="00:17:39.510" style="s2">Skeptical mode so that pushes back against the very broad claims that the early modernists are</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.570" end="00:17:43.709" style="s2">Making that the power of reason is great</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.710" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">It is highly competent and that essentially we can figure out all of the important truths of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:52.770" style="s2">We can come up with a big story that explains everything ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.320" end="00:17:59.579" style="s2">not necessarily that any one individual will contain all of that knowledge in his or her mind, but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.220" end="00:18:03.270" style="s2">Communally, there will have a huge amount of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.270" end="00:18:06.089" style="s2">we will slowly as you&#39;re putting it together piece together a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.340" end="00:18:10.600" style="s2">big pictures worried about the way the world works and then in principle</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.600" end="00:18:17.050" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s nothing about the universe that we can&#39;t figure out. They&#39;re just things that we haven&#39;t been able to figure out yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.290" end="00:18:23.800" style="s2">So the skepticism that leotard and the others are talking about is a skepticism about that grand set of claims</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.800" end="00:18:27.729" style="s2">Right a meta-narrative a narrative that encompasses everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.480" end="00:18:31.480" style="s2">Instead we&#39;re left with smaller</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:38.410" style="s2">narratives and then as the movement develops, we should be skeptical even about the truth status or the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.110" end="00:18:42.490" style="s2">the knowledge status of those smaller narratives</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.830" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">so what becomes important in the postmodern tradition is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.880" end="00:18:53.229" style="s2">Skepticism about our ability to know the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.110" end="00:19:02.020" style="s2">And in milder form as much as the modern thinkers thought we could and in stronger postmodern form at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.120" end="00:19:06.550" style="s2">That maybe there is no such thing as truth. No, such thing as knowledge instead</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.550" end="00:19:12.609" style="s2">All we have is opinions and beliefs that are subjectively held but don&#39;t have any objective</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.710" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">Influence so sewer, for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.890" end="00:19:22.209" style="s2">They seem to be convinced in some strange way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.850" end="00:19:24.500" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.500" end="00:19:25.940" style="s2">disturbed me</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.940" end="00:19:29.259" style="s2">When I first really discovered dictionaries when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.200" end="00:19:30.760" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:31.910" style="s2">I&#39;d look up a word in the dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.910" end="00:19:36.759" style="s2">And of course, it would just refer to another word in the dictionary and that would refer to another word in the dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.830" end="00:19:44.770" style="s2">and yes in some sense any definition outside of the dictionary and the French intellectuals that were so</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.980" end="00:19:53.170" style="s2">Influential in the postmodern world seemed to think of meaning in exactly that way they exactly understand that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.050" end="00:19:58.389" style="s2">Linguistic meaning is necessarily embedded in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.700" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">Linguistic context so that each word is dependent on each phrase and each phrase is dependent on each sentence. And so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:07.310" style="s2">contextual</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.310" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">dependency</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:10.630" style="s2">absolutely on</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.730" end="00:20:18.520" style="s2">Linguistic framing but they seem to me to and and this is one of the major problems I think of post-modernism in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.770" end="00:20:20.770" style="s2">university is that they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.160" end="00:20:23.150" style="s2">deny, or ignore</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.150" end="00:20:28.269" style="s2">The existence of any world whatsoever outside of linguistic construction</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.460" end="00:20:32.710" style="s2">And that&#39;s that&#39;s something that strikes me as extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.230" end="00:20:38.410" style="s2">curious that that like it&#39;s a real denial of nature in my estimation, but also something</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:44.650" style="s2">tremendously dangerous because well, assuming that you think that physics and biology and chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:51.759" style="s2">Actually have any sort of genuine reality. It denies the existence of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.340" end="00:20:54.910" style="s2">substrate of existence that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.610" end="00:20:59.890" style="s2">purely linguistic relates to I mean, I always think of words as being</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.820" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">They&#39;re not so much descriptions, they&#39;re tools that you use to like and that&#39;s a Vidkun Stinney anigh Diaz</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:11.080" style="s2">That words are really tools that you use to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.480" end="00:21:19.000" style="s2">operate on the world width and the consequences of those operations are actually manifest in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:24.759" style="s2">sensation and perception and emotion and motivation and embodiment rather than purely on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:29.770" style="s2">linguistic level and so I also don&#39;t really understand how it could be that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.440" end="00:21:37.510" style="s2">intellectuals could come to the conclusion that are and this seems like a primarily French idea that hmm our ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.120" end="00:21:39.890" style="s2">primarily constructed</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.890" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">linguistically, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:49.060" style="s2">How do I resist under those circumstances? Yeah, now that strong form of linguistic skepticism that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.640" end="00:21:56.170" style="s2">Articulating is most pronounced in Jacque Derrida, and he does bill himself as a post</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:21:59.500" style="s2">structuralist and that&#39;s a linguistic version of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.020" end="00:22:01.250" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.250" end="00:22:03.430" style="s2">but the the challenge here is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.520" end="00:22:06.849" style="s2">Our view is that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.400" end="00:22:08.990" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.990" end="00:22:14.530" style="s2">Relational phenomenon it&#39;s responsive to an external world and that should be the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.050" end="00:22:17.030" style="s2">realist commitment that we make</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.030" end="00:22:22.540" style="s2">The problem that the the post-structuralist are coming up with by the time we get to Dairy da I should say</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.060" end="00:22:25.359" style="s2">the idea that there isn&#39;t any sort of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.820" end="00:22:30.220" style="s2">substrate matching on to not all of the post modernists will buy into that as</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.380" end="00:22:34.869" style="s2">Strongly as dairy Dodd does they will might say well there&#39;s something out there, but which is can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.239" end="00:22:40.599" style="s2">What the relationship is between our concepts and our words and an external reality?</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.179" end="00:22:44.589" style="s2">So the point though, is that the words that we use are</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.109" end="00:22:50.829" style="s2">abstractions and they do come along fairly far or high up in our cognitive development and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.129" end="00:22:54.129" style="s2">if you want to argue that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.230" end="00:23:01.959" style="s2">Consciousness is a response to reality or that consciousness is a relational phenomenon as I do to maintain that objective</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.539" end="00:23:06.248" style="s2">relational commitment there or you then have to do is take up all of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.830" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">skeptical arguments that want to put consciousness out of relationship or to say that there&#39;s no way to bridge this gap between</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:16.340" style="s2">the subject and the object</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.340" end="00:23:18.340" style="s2">Once you start going down that road</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">If you want to say for example, that perception is fraught with</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.330" end="00:23:26.649" style="s2">allusions or hallucinations or that we can&#39;t tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.230" end="00:23:28.369" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.369" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">vertical</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.539" style="s2">Perception when our sensory organs are in contact with reality and a hallucination</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.749" end="00:23:35.230" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.230" end="00:23:42.999" style="s2">Then you have a gap between our conscious apparatus and reality if you then want to go on and argue as empiricists do</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:45.230" style="s2">that our</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.230" end="00:23:49.179" style="s2">Concepts and the words that we assign to the concepts are based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.789" end="00:23:50.809" style="s2">empirical</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.809" end="00:23:55.988" style="s2">observations or perceptual observations, but you now believe that those perceptual observations are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.509" end="00:24:02.319" style="s2">Subjective and out of relation with objective reality. Then you&#39;re going to say these</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.929" end="00:24:10.719" style="s2">abstract concepts and words are also out of relation with reality and then what gives them their meaning if you can&#39;t establish a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.029" end="00:24:12.169" style="s2">the words and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.169" end="00:24:12.739" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.739" end="00:24:19.569" style="s2">then you&#39;re into the dictionary you&#39;re saying well what gives the words their meaning is their sideways or network connections to other words and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.759" end="00:24:24.878" style="s2">Then a generation or two later you&#39;re into Derrida&#39;s University where he says</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.489" end="00:24:27.519" style="s2">Where the language is all of reality?</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.489" end="00:24:34.449" style="s2">That&#39;s also where the postmodernists claim about. The primacy of power seemed to sneak in</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.269" end="00:24:38.858" style="s2">It&#39;s like well if the words are only related to one another</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:42.489" style="s2">They&#39;re verbal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.489" end="00:24:44.949" style="s2">Well, they don&#39;t seem to have any motive force</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.950" end="00:24:51.400" style="s2">And as soon as you enter a lens of linguistic consideration that has no motive force</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.400" end="00:24:53.400" style="s2">then there&#39;s nothing to do and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.110" end="00:24:58.270" style="s2">This seems to me to account for God being criticized very often for</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.970" end="00:25:02.560" style="s2">Let&#39;s say conflating post-modernism and Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.870" end="00:25:09.339" style="s2">But it seems to me that the Marxists or that the post modernists have had the default to what are essentially Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.620" end="00:25:12.849" style="s2">preconceptions to add any motive to their thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.100" end="00:25:20.380" style="s2">what they&#39;ve done is to say that well words are related to one another and that&#39;s how they derive their fundamental meaning and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.380" end="00:25:22.630" style="s2">really connected to the world in any real way</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.390" end="00:25:25.930" style="s2">Except insofar as they privileged</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.330" end="00:25:33.790" style="s2">One group or another or one point other in terms of power and status which exactly sort of go back to your dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:38.319" style="s2">Analysis that the next step then would be to say if words are in these</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:42.790" style="s2">Linguistic relationships to other words and we can find out what they are in dictionaries</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.790" end="00:25:49.180" style="s2">Well who writes the dictionaries and then at that point or you&#39;re not asking an epistemological?</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.580" end="00:25:52.960" style="s2">Question anymore. You are asking a social and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.540" end="00:25:57.069" style="s2">Question. So who are the authors of the dictionary? What author?</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:05.470" style="s2">authorizes rather than with the power to decide what words mean at that point we step directly out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.810" end="00:26:07.790" style="s2">No kind of narrow epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.790" end="00:26:10.629" style="s2">arguments into social and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:13.780" style="s2">arguments about linguistic communities so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:27.040" style="s2">One another and there&#39;s this gap between the words and empirical reality which by the way I don&#39;t think anybody disputes</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.140" end="00:26:32.079" style="s2">I mean, that&#39;s why we need five senses. That&#39;s why we need to communicate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:37.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why we need the scientific method right is because it&#39;s difficult to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.910" end="00:26:41.859" style="s2">useful one-to-one relationship between words and reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.870" end="00:26:48.219" style="s2">But if words serve power then it seems to me that what the post modernists have done is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.770" end="00:26:50.600" style="s2">taken</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.600" end="00:26:52.040" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.040" end="00:26:59.649" style="s2">motivation let&#39;s call it the motivation for power at least and and sneaked it through the back door and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.440" end="00:27:02.440" style="s2">reconnected the world linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.060" end="00:27:06.200" style="s2">abstraction to the world of reality but</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.780" end="00:27:07.910" style="s2">Saying well</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.910" end="00:27:08.430" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.430" end="00:27:14.749" style="s2">the only connection is one of power and then they leave why it is that people want power like</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.910" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">the idea that people want power first of all, it&#39;s complicated idea because you have to define power and you have to define what and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.310" end="00:27:27.289" style="s2">those aren&#39;t trivial issues by any stretch of the imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.129" style="s2">So you you you sleek it in the back door is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.450" style="s2">Self-evident and then that seems to undermine the general post modernist claim</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.450" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">It&#39;s like if it&#39;s if the words are only embedded in a network of meaning that&#39;s related to other words then</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.270" end="00:27:51.920" style="s2">It isn&#39;t a fair move on to logically or epistemologically to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.640" end="00:27:54.810" style="s2">Reinsert</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.810" end="00:28:01.789" style="s2">power striving like a nietzsche and power striving or even in Adlerian power striving as the fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.670" end="00:28:05.060" style="s2">What you call it sort of sui generis</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:07.800" style="s2">motivation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.800" end="00:28:12.230" style="s2">Characterizes human beings so I also don&#39;t understand how they get away with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.390" end="00:28:18.770" style="s2">Except that it seems to be like a mask for the continuation of a Marxist move on new guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.680" end="00:28:23.180" style="s2">Well, I have no problem with seeing power as a positive</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:27.379" style="s2">Coming back to just in a moment to all of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.260" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">Suspicions that you&#39;re announcing about inappropriate understandings of the relationship of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:40.580" style="s2">I do think we should be able to say our cognitive capacities are a power that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.250" end="00:28:48.560" style="s2">we they are a tool and the whole point of using that tool is to increase our power in the world to achieve our</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.780" end="00:28:49.920" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.920" end="00:28:52.129" style="s2">what the postmoderns are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.150" end="00:29:01.999" style="s2">Undercutting the two things that make that understanding of power legitimate one is to say that when I am making a cognitive claim</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">I am</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:10.820" style="s2">Successfully saying something about the world so that we can use the words knowledge and truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.820" end="00:29:13.909" style="s2">so if I want to act on the basis of my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.919" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">that those beliefs do map onto world as it really is but if you are skeptical about any sort of a knowledge claim</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.870" end="00:29:25.620" style="s2">Or any sort of a truth claim then you&#39;re just going to say no. No</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.380" end="00:29:29.579" style="s2">Your claims merely are subjective</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.789" end="00:29:37.199" style="s2">Beliefs that are peculiar to you or peculiar to your group and they don&#39;t have any special cognitive status</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.990" end="00:29:44.099" style="s2">Whatsoever. And in that case if you want to act on or use those beliefs to empower you well</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.100" end="00:29:46.100" style="s2">Then you are in an out of reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:47.730" style="s2">connection now</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.730" end="00:29:55.049" style="s2">The other thing though is we want to say that power should be a tool that we use for good for advancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.419" end="00:29:57.419" style="s2">genuine values in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.429" end="00:30:04.229" style="s2">But another part of the postmodern skepticism is to say that we cannot ground any values objectively</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.659" end="00:30:10.018" style="s2">Instead values are merely subjective preferences either individually or group oriented</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:16.620" style="s2">So in that case, if you have your value framework, then we&#39;re into the problem of relativism that I have my value framework</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.169" end="00:30:24.778" style="s2">neither of us is able to adduce any facts that give an objective grounding to those values or to argue that those values should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.090" end="00:30:26.409" style="s2">universally embraced</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.409" end="00:30:31.559" style="s2">Then we&#39;re just left with you have a certain amount of power to advance your interest</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.559" end="00:30:34.229" style="s2">I have a certain amount of power to advance my interests and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.779" end="00:30:39.268" style="s2">it&#39;s a naked power struggle in the suspicious way that you&#39;re worried about and that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:47.730" style="s2">We come back to this issue of how Marxist or not the postmodern czar, but you&#39;re right that at least the great-grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.370" end="00:30:52.319" style="s2">Move it was made by the Marxists in one generation and the Nietzschean</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.659" end="00:30:57.719" style="s2">next generation to strip power down to that amoral</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.019" end="00:31:05.159" style="s2">Ontological status that you are worried about but but what&#39;s the motivation for it? It&#39;s like if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.100" end="00:31:10.319" style="s2">Reality that&#39;s outside the linguistic and why is it?</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.629" end="00:31:13.859" style="s2">Why is it that first of all what is well, I think there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.019" end="00:31:16.019" style="s2">Yeah, I think there are two kinds of motivations</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.019" end="00:31:22.679" style="s2">One of the one of the things we know is that there are people who just like power they want to control other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.779" end="00:31:24.210" style="s2">They have their agendas</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.210" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">No, we can talk about the sociological and the psychological foundation of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:31.469" style="s2">But that is an ongoing fact about society</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.470" end="00:31:36.179" style="s2">some people just want power and they will then rationalize their</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.549" end="00:31:41.488" style="s2">Use of power over other people by a variety of means, okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.119" end="00:31:46.319" style="s2">That&#39;s one that is an extra linguistic reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.850" style="s2">Yes thing that&#39;s so surprising. It&#39;s like I&#39;m not using that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.759" end="00:31:57.419" style="s2">Let me see the case. You think right if you think of the way some lawyers argue in a courtroom?</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.139" end="00:32:04.319" style="s2">They will use all sorts of reach out or rhetorical power plays they will make fallacious</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.450" end="00:32:06.029" style="s2">Arguments if they can get away with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.029" end="00:32:11.878" style="s2">It will browbeat witnesses and make up facts and so forth now, they are not really skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.879" end="00:32:14.459" style="s2">They believe that there&#39;s an external world and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.499" end="00:32:21.988" style="s2">They just believe that life is a power struggle and any tactic is fair in order to achieve their ends. All right, so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.629" end="00:32:28.349" style="s2">Postmodernist lawyers, they&#39;re just old-fashioned power seeking lawyers and so forth now that is one motivation</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.350" end="00:32:29.850" style="s2">It comes up in religious circles</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.850" end="00:32:32.639" style="s2">It comes up in political circles that comes up in the school yard</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.830" end="00:32:37.109" style="s2">And so on but the other one in the one that I think that we are worried about though</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.109" end="00:32:41.639" style="s2">Is that those who get to that view about the amoral ontological?</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.909" end="00:32:44.440" style="s2">substrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.440" end="00:32:48.059" style="s2">being power are those people who are smart and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.759" end="00:32:55.979" style="s2">Who do some thinking about philosophy thinking about politics and so forth and they argue themselves into that position?</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.710" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">because they find the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.259" end="00:33:03.358" style="s2">Power of those skeptical arguments to be convincing rationally to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.549" end="00:33:07.829" style="s2">So even though the this is not a paradoxical formulation, even though they are rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.440" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">Individuals, they are following the logic of certain skeptical arguments to its conclusion and the legitimate conclusion of those arguments</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:23.249" style="s2">Is that a moral power rules the universe? Okay. So so let&#39;s let&#39;s examine that for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.249" end="00:33:25.499" style="s2">I mean, this is another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.019" end="00:33:28.019" style="s2">strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:34.648" style="s2">Specious to say the least. I mean first of all, I&#39;m very skeptical of people who try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.099" end="00:33:40.919" style="s2">reduce all complex phenomena to a single explanatory mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.020" end="00:33:45.410" style="s2">No, I mean if you look at because I do look at things biologically</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.630" end="00:33:50.060" style="s2">It&#39;s obvious that human beings have a multitude of primordial</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:57.229" style="s2">Motivational systems and that we share them and that we share them with animals. There&#39;s pain and there&#39;s fear and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.780" end="00:34:04.190" style="s2">incentive reward and there&#39;s rage and there&#39;s play and there&#39;s hunger and there&#39;s lust and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.530" end="00:34:09.169" style="s2">That&#39;s a handful that there&#39;s more than that and these are very and you know those</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.380" end="00:34:13.099" style="s2">motivations get integrated across time into</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.860" end="00:34:21.169" style="s2">Hyper motivations let&#39;s say that would be something akin to an integrated narrative one. That is</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.960" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">Manifested interpersonally, but also played out socially and higher-order values emerge from that. Um,</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.370" end="00:34:33.859" style="s2">You take a claim like the post modernist make that well, first of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:41.479" style="s2">they accept the idea that there&#39;s almost nothing but hierarchy and that people&#39;s fundamental motivations is to climb up the hierarchy even though they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.330" end="00:34:47.929" style="s2">My experience has been for example, whenever I talk about hierarchy the postmodernist types go after me</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.940" end="00:34:54.409" style="s2">Because I&#39;m making the claim that hierarchy is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.050" end="00:35:00.949" style="s2">Phenomenon not necessarily a beneficial one, but an inevitable one in some sense with its pros and cons</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.950" end="00:35:08.179" style="s2">but they accept that uncritically when they presume that power is the fundamental drive and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.430" end="00:35:12.409" style="s2">Problem is and this is an even more serious one as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.410" end="00:35:19.370" style="s2">Is that the evidence that the most effective way for human beings to?</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.430" end="00:35:21.930" style="s2">occupy</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.930" end="00:35:25.790" style="s2">positions of authority, let&#39;s say and competence in</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.820" end="00:35:30.620" style="s2">Human dominance hierarchies isn&#39;t through the naked expression of power</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.870" end="00:35:36.349" style="s2">That&#39;s actually unbelievably unstable, you know even Fran&#39;s de Waal when he was studying chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.420" end="00:35:41.750" style="s2">You know, the female chimpanzees are more empathetic than the male chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:50.210" style="s2">But of all the chimpanzees, the alpha males are the most impacted. They&#39;re the ones that engage in the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.730" end="00:35:52.410" style="s2">reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.410" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">interactions with the members of the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.490" end="00:35:59.479" style="s2">And there&#39;s evidence occurring from all sorts of areas including</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.180" end="00:36:05.060" style="s2">developmental psychology the developmental psychology of Piaget for example that suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.790" end="00:36:07.790" style="s2">like something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.460" end="00:36:12.020" style="s2">cooperative game playing aim towards a particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.599" end="00:36:17.029" style="s2">Important end is a much more stable means for establishing</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.090" end="00:36:22.519" style="s2">Hierarchical relationships between people than power. It&#39;s like power</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.070" end="00:36:30.619" style="s2">only rules in tyrannies and and I guess maybe that&#39;s part of the reason that the post modernists also insists that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.840" end="00:36:38.659" style="s2">The Western hierarch is fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy because that justifies their claim. That power is the primary</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.869" end="00:36:44.299" style="s2">Motivator and mover of the world, but I just don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a tenable position</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.420" end="00:36:46.680" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.680" end="00:36:54.109" style="s2">well, I think ontologically it&#39;s fair to say that most postmoderns buy into the notion that power is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:57.349" style="s2">Fundamentally, there&#39;s not anything that can be reduced to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.750" end="00:37:04.280" style="s2">but that my reading of them is that that is not the entire philosophical story because power just is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.890" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">tool a means to an end and that still leaves open the question of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.330" end="00:37:16.009" style="s2">what ends - which one is going to use that power and here and I think the postmoderns are</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.440" end="00:37:21.589" style="s2">Rightly diverse in their views. There is a strong streak of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.589" end="00:37:28.099" style="s2">Then this is something that goes back to Marxism in general or broadly socialism in general. That will say</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.130" end="00:37:30.990" style="s2">Yes, we all want</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.990" end="00:37:34.490" style="s2">power but we recognize that power is</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:39.409" style="s2">Unequally distributed in the world and that connects to your points about hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.080" end="00:37:42.080" style="s2">But what is your value?</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.450" end="00:37:46.939" style="s2">reaction to that unequal distribution of power in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">Now there are the Nietzschean who will react to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:50.970" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.970" end="00:37:58.970" style="s2">the unequal distribution of power is fine and our sympathies are with those who have more power because we want them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.670" end="00:38:07.159" style="s2">Advance the human species by some evolutionary mechanism, but that is a subjective value preference that they are adding to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.170" end="00:38:12.330" style="s2">Previous facts that power is fundamental that power is unequally distributed</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.150" end="00:38:18.060" style="s2">now we&#39;re adding my sympathies are with those who have more power the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.730" end="00:38:26.369" style="s2">Socialist or more narrowly Marxist response to those to say power is fundamental power is unequally distributed</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.130" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">But our empathy is with those who are on the losing side of history</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:34.859" style="s2">So to speak or a various source of social forces</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.859" end="00:38:41.849" style="s2">And so what that then means for them is that they will accept that power is operating in an hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.310" end="00:38:45.629" style="s2">Context but that they want to use whatever power they have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.270" end="00:38:47.410" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.410" end="00:38:49.889" style="s2">equally redistribute the power in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.430" end="00:38:53.020" style="s2">In a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.020" end="00:38:54.190" style="s2">egalitarian fashion</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.190" end="00:39:01.020" style="s2">The only needs to talk about it&#39;s going to be though that third component about what your value</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.390" end="00:39:05.190" style="s2">Reaction is to what you take to be the metaphysical substrate</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.670" end="00:39:12.149" style="s2">There&#39;s another form of real world smuggling that goes along with that which is both</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.030" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">ontological and ethical and the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.080" end="00:39:21.869" style="s2">Smuggling would be while there are definitely power structures and that people compete for power</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.200" end="00:39:27.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s claim number one, which seems to be extra linguistic and claim number two is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.109" end="00:39:32.969" style="s2">the proper moral stance of a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.940" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">empathy so there&#39;s a claim that something like empathy exists and that he should be reserved for people who are on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.780" end="00:39:45.689" style="s2">Lower end of the hierarchical distribution. That&#39;s right. Okay, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.600" end="00:39:49.229" style="s2">Postmoderns like Foucault make that very clear</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.470" end="00:39:51.910" style="s2">Richard Rorty</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.910" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">even more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.220" end="00:39:56.020" style="s2">makes that claim</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.020" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2">Jacques Derrida is a very interesting case because most of his work is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.490" end="00:40:06.869" style="s2">Not overtly social ethical or political but at various points particularly toward the end of his life</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.869" end="00:40:09.358" style="s2">He says, you know, my my entire sympathies are with</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.300" end="00:40:12.300" style="s2">the oppressed and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.550" end="00:40:15.779" style="s2">Reinvigorating a certain kind of or in the spirit of Marxism something or other</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.359" end="00:40:18.090" style="s2">but from his perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.090" end="00:40:22.589" style="s2">He recognizes that he has no philosophical resort to justify</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.900" end="00:40:26.819" style="s2">that value claim and he doesn&#39;t want to say that it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.309" end="00:40:33.509" style="s2">personal subjective preference that he has so he does appeal to a kind of Conti and regulative idea or</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.940" end="00:40:41.220" style="s2">What we&#39;re in more old-fashioned whether it&#39;s a kind of platonic form that that we need to appeal to if we&#39;re going to justify</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.770" end="00:40:44.099" style="s2">in some way so it&#39;s kind of interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.819" end="00:40:48.989" style="s2">Recognizing exactly the problem that you&#39;re pointing out. Where do we get that?</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.720" end="00:40:53.939" style="s2">empathy claim from and justify that the postmoderns</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:41:00.089" style="s2">Recognize the predicament and some of them are trying to point to extra linguistic sources for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.309" end="00:41:06.809" style="s2">Well that opens that opens a big can of worms if your initial claim is that there&#39;s no such thing as an extra linguistic source</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.270" end="00:41:13.709" style="s2">Exactly. Yes, because you let one extra linguistic source in especially something as complicated as the interplay between</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.559" end="00:41:18.569" style="s2">Say power hierarchy and empathy. I mean, yes, those are major</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.630" end="00:41:25.109" style="s2">motivational forces and then if you&#39;re willing to admit to the existence of those major</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.220" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">Motivational forces. Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to exclude pain. It&#39;s hard to exclude anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:37.439" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to exclude or something even more basic is hunger</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.049" end="00:41:40.049" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.270" end="00:41:47.729" style="s2">The proclivity for cooperation and play it&#39;s like all of biology. It seems to me sneaks back into</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.279" end="00:41:52.109" style="s2">the postmodern project as soon as those initial</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.460" end="00:42:02.399" style="s2">Well, absolutely, but that&#39;s what we&#39;re finding a lot of our debates are right now about psychology and biology</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.069" end="00:42:09.028" style="s2">Is that certain number of psychologists and biologists are pushing back and saying oh there is a reality here or we&#39;re getting great</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.250" end="00:42:14.669" style="s2">Resistance from the postmodern second and third generation to having to do so</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.400" end="00:42:22.619" style="s2">Okay. So now you said the philosophers that have reviewed your book have been basically positive and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.109" end="00:42:25.679" style="s2">Why are you receiving?</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.740" end="00:42:32.219" style="s2">Positive feedback from what is it about philosophy and about philosophers or about your work?</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.510" end="00:42:36.860" style="s2">Eliciting a positive response from them. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.590" end="00:42:42.259" style="s2">Well, my book is primarily an intellectual history to some extent I am</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.780" end="00:42:48.590" style="s2">Polemical and pushing back against post-modernism. So people don&#39;t understand that. I&#39;m taking a stance as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.900" end="00:42:52.549" style="s2">But the primary purpose of the book is to do a solid intellectual history</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.550" end="00:42:59.120" style="s2">where does this confusing sprawling but nonetheless very vigorous and powerful movement come from and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t come out of thin air, but rather there&#39;s a lot of deep thinking that&#39;s behind it</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.680" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">So what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m tracing what I see as the important intellectual movements of the last two centuries</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.860" end="00:43:17.209" style="s2">So I&#39;m starting with Contin Rousseau. I&#39;m talking about Hegel marx, nietzsche Heidegger and the others so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.780" end="00:43:20.780" style="s2">All of those figures are</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:28.670" style="s2">difficult complex and important in their own right and there are scholarly debate about say how skeptical or not Conte is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.010" end="00:43:32.150" style="s2">whether there&#39;s an element of liberalism or not in each</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.150" end="00:43:35.479" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s connection to the Nazis and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.180" end="00:43:39.710" style="s2">So there is a range of scholarly movement and most of these major</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.770" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">Intellectuals have two or three major schools of interpretation attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.530" end="00:43:49.640" style="s2">But what and so the pushback that I am getting on</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.250" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2">contour unmeet or Heidegger or whatever will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.610" end="00:44:00.979" style="s2">From those who are in a different school of interpretation with respect to them, but typically among the Philosopher&#39;s it&#39;s a respectful</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.890" end="00:44:09.739" style="s2">Engagement because they will recognize that there is a very good argument that can be made for interpreting. The Philosopher&#39;s the other way</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.890" end="00:44:16.429" style="s2">and typically then what I&#39;m doing is emphasizing the skeptical elements or they ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.340" end="00:44:21.110" style="s2">Negative and nihilistic elements that get sifted out and woven together</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.810" end="00:44:28.100" style="s2">Into ultimately the the postmodern framework and along the way the Philosopher&#39;s who want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.100" end="00:44:32.600" style="s2">Well, you know this particular thinker is not that bad or you would not buy into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.750" end="00:44:41.239" style="s2">Project. Those are the ones who will criticize me on various things, but I typically find though outside of philosophical circles</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:47.419" style="s2">though is and that this is not a criticism of these individuals since we can&#39;t know ever thing is that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.390" end="00:44:54.440" style="s2">Will know something about Nietzsche or Heidegger or or Conte, but they&#39;re not up on the scholarly literature</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.450" end="00:44:59.179" style="s2">You know, they&#39;ve read one book or one article about that person that was written from a certain perspective</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:05.659" style="s2">So if I make the argument for the other perspective on that thinker it&#39;s new to them and it seems outrageous to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.660" end="00:45:11.360" style="s2">And so they will react negatively to it. So something like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.780" end="00:45:20.330" style="s2">So now you wrote this book back in 2004. So you were pretty early observer of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.960" end="00:45:23.250" style="s2">The</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.250" end="00:45:26.899" style="s2">Vital importance. I suppose of the post modernist debate</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.900" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">I mean there it certainly be none rise in political correctness in the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:35.899" style="s2">and that&#39;s it disappear by the mid 90s, but</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.080" end="00:45:42.469" style="s2">2004 is I would say five or six or maybe even eight years</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.230" end="00:45:45.469" style="s2">previous to the to this new</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.890" end="00:45:48.300" style="s2">burgeoning of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.300" end="00:45:55.909" style="s2">Political polarization and and the debate between the politically correct types. Let&#39;s say and those who take a more</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.490" end="00:46:01.729" style="s2">biological perspective it&#39;s like what clued you into the fact that this was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.300" end="00:46:07.999" style="s2">Issue of fundamental of potentially fundamental importance. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.790" end="00:46:13.459" style="s2">Well, yeah, thanks. I think if there&#39;s a testament to the power of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.040" end="00:46:17.149" style="s2">philosophy the power of ideas the power of logic that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.820" end="00:46:19.770" style="s2">when you identify</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.770" end="00:46:25.009" style="s2">Abstract principles and their adoption and you have a good sense of logic you can make predictions</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.140" end="00:46:29.390" style="s2">About how they&#39;re going to play out when they are applied in real life</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.180" end="00:46:35.120" style="s2">This is one of my major career beliefs that philosophy is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.300" end="00:46:40.999" style="s2">disembodied abstract head in the clouds, but no matter how abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.820" end="00:46:44.149" style="s2">speculative various philosophical positions</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.970" end="00:46:52.520" style="s2">Seem to be when they are believed and acted upon the they make a real-life difference</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.520" end="00:46:54.350" style="s2">So in part, that&#39;s what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.350" end="00:46:59.529" style="s2">I actually wrote the first draft of the book 20 years ago this year in nineteen 9</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.530" end="00:47:04.119" style="s2">I had a sabbatical and so I I had an outline of the book written in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.520" end="00:47:08.889" style="s2">1999 and then by the middle part of the year 2000 I had</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.470" end="00:47:15.669" style="s2">Fully written the book but it didn&#39;t come out till 2004 because I had some challenges with getting getting it published</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.730" end="00:47:23.559" style="s2">I think what has happened in the last 5 years or so is that we are now into second or third generation</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.470" end="00:47:32.020" style="s2">Post-modernism depending on how you count things and what has happened is the the first generation of postmoderns were very successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.020" end="00:47:38.799" style="s2">Inside academic circles at educating large numbers of students getting a significant number of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.109" end="00:47:42.969" style="s2">through graduate school and then to themselves becoming</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:50.949" style="s2">Professors and public intellectuals and things reached a critical mass. I would say starting six or seven years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.950" end="00:47:55.210" style="s2">So then we start to notice it significantly starting to transform</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.940" end="00:48:02.889" style="s2">The internal demand dynamics of the university but we also now have a critical mass of activists who are now</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.170" end="00:48:05.829" style="s2">Graduated maybe they didn&#39;t graduate with PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.829" end="00:48:08.048" style="s2">They got bachelor&#39;s degrees or master&#39;s degrees</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:15.069" style="s2">But they&#39;ve gone into activist organizations and they are trying to and successfully</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.470" end="00:48:17.470" style="s2">shifting the terms of the debate</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:23.049" style="s2">Outside of the academic world and so the broader public starts to notice things</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:25.460" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.460" end="00:48:28.270" style="s2">That&#39;s where we are right now with the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.940" end="00:48:34.359" style="s2">manifesting itself on two major fronts the academic world and the broader cultural space</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.150" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">So what are your concerns about that like when you look out at the world?</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:45.849" style="s2">You are obviously concerned enough about post modernist thinking to devote a</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.099" end="00:48:51.578" style="s2">Substantial proportion of your academic career to it and then to put yourself on the line to some degree as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.089" end="00:48:56.048" style="s2">What is it about the post modernist view that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.670" end="00:49:01.389" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s ask this question two ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.750" end="00:49:04.750" style="s2">What do you think?</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.849" end="00:49:06.829" style="s2">the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.829" end="00:49:13.488" style="s2">if any are to the post modernist view or the inevitability of it and what you think the dangers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">Disadvantages are hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.200" end="00:49:21.470" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s to two big questions first. Why why I&#39;m worried about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.049" end="00:49:26.059" style="s2">And there&#39;s a question about what degree of worry right one should have</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.059" end="00:49:29.238" style="s2">Interestingly and my home discipline of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.539" end="00:49:35.209" style="s2">Post-modernism is not that strong part of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.660" end="00:49:38.660" style="s2">flirted with and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.479" end="00:49:40.819" style="s2">Post-modernism for a while</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.819" end="00:49:46.548" style="s2">I think philosophy did generate all of the arguments or we saw the major arguments that postmoderns use</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.859" end="00:49:52.369" style="s2">the force if he does have built into its DNA, so to speak a very healthy respect for</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.220" end="00:49:55.220" style="s2">argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.039" end="00:49:58.819" style="s2">A no liking for new argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.819" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">So what has happened mostly in the philosophy profession is a serious development and engagement with all of these negative</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.089" end="00:50:08.629" style="s2">skeptical arguments and so on but then a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:14.989" style="s2">realization that a lot of them don&#39;t work in various ways and then people moving off in other directions or</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.420" end="00:50:17.960" style="s2">once we start seeing the same arguments being</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.599" end="00:50:22.909" style="s2">recycled and retreading a certain amount of boredom occurs with it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.579" end="00:50:27.709" style="s2">smart active minded people live like new things and so someone comes along with a new</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.959" style="s2">Positive argument or a new positive program and philosophers get excited about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:37.819" style="s2">And so post-modernism is a little bit passe in those disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:40.460" style="s2">But I am worried about it because philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.670" end="00:50:44.149" style="s2">Demographically is a tiny proportion of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.029" end="00:50:51.169" style="s2">Academy and the postmodern arguments have been picked up by the larger and more influential</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">academic disciplines such as</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.089" end="00:50:55.039" style="s2">psychology, right</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.039" end="00:51:00.709" style="s2">You know this one as well english literature to some extent in the law schools in the field of history sociology</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.109" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">is very polluted and then the the big rise of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.849" end="00:51:07.759" style="s2">various special Studies programs</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.759" end="00:51:14.869" style="s2">You know gender studies race studies ethnicity studies and so on you find a much higher percentage of post-modernism there now</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.910" end="00:51:17.149" style="s2">I have not seen good</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.999" end="00:51:25.339" style="s2">journalistic sociology about higher academic - whether it&#39;s 8 percent or 40 percent of people who are postmodern or</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:33.899" style="s2">But there clearly is an uptick statistically significant increase in the number of people who are adopting</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.690" end="00:51:35.710" style="s2">post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.710" end="00:51:42.509" style="s2">Viewpoints and then educating the next generation of students. Yes. Why don&#39;t the activist types</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.970" end="00:51:45.389" style="s2">Yeah, absolutely. Yes, that&#39;s right. So</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.690" end="00:51:49.049" style="s2">There is that this is a non philosophical issue</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.049" end="00:51:52.049" style="s2">this is a journalistic or a demographical issue about</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.450" end="00:51:57.929" style="s2">measuring to what extent it&#39;s a rising movement how widespread it is and so on and my concern</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.359" end="00:52:05.278" style="s2">professionally is with the arguments that generate post-modernism and refuting those now why this is important is</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.710" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">Well, you know, I&#39;m a professor</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:14.339" style="s2">So I&#39;m always dealing with young people who are at the early stages of their their careers and in my view the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.799" end="00:52:16.690" style="s2">That we all need</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.690" end="00:52:20.909" style="s2">As human beings were thoughtful people. We want to be passionately engaged with the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.910" end="00:52:26.910" style="s2">we want our lives to be meaningful is we do need a philosophy of life that&#39;s going to success set us up for</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.609" end="00:52:32.879" style="s2">The best chance of succeeding in our lives as possible. So in my view</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.579" end="00:52:37.619" style="s2">Basically an optimist we do need as young people</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.049" end="00:52:45.929" style="s2">With our whole lives ahead to have some sense that my life is going to be meaningful. It&#39;s going to be significant that there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:49.199" style="s2">important values that I can strive for</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.430" end="00:52:56.789" style="s2">The romantic in me wants to say my life can and should be this great adventure and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.089" end="00:53:01.859" style="s2">Having that fundamental commitment and helping students sort out</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.859" end="00:53:07.318" style="s2">What are the genuine values that are worth pursuing in life that has to be?</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:09.700" style="s2">instilled in young people</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.700" end="00:53:16.409" style="s2">Otherwise, they will just drift through life and then they will get to their older years and realized that their life is frittered away</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.869" end="00:53:20.068" style="s2">Yes, okay. So that&#39;s an interesting. No, that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.619" end="00:53:22.390" style="s2">observation because you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.390" end="00:53:25.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to account at least in part for</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.619" end="00:53:28.679" style="s2">well, let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.849" end="00:53:34.528" style="s2">Surprising and surreal popularity of my public lectures</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.410" end="00:53:39.529" style="s2">so absolutely yes about a hundred and fifty cities now to about</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.170" end="00:53:44.599" style="s2">300,000 people and you know, I lay out a fairly straightforward case</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.599" end="00:53:52.068" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s very much analogous to the case that you just described and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.950" end="00:53:55.399" style="s2">Well, we looked for some</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.039" end="00:53:58.019" style="s2">unassailable truth</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.019" end="00:53:59.940" style="s2">and for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.940" end="00:54:04.849" style="s2">There are two unassailable pessimistic truths and one. Is that a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.700" end="00:54:11.569" style="s2">Substantial proportion of life is going to be suffering because we&#39;re finite and even if things are going well for you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.569" end="00:54:17.719" style="s2">Now you&#39;re subject to illness mental and physical you&#39;re subject to the decimation of your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.720" end="00:54:23.269" style="s2">You&#39;re going to lose the people that you love the world that you know is going to change in ways that you find</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:29.719" style="s2">disconcerting and unfortunate and so sufferings built in and then if you don&#39;t want me</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:36.679" style="s2">Interrupting at that point the the phrase unassailable truth and what we should be doing though in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.470" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">education is</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">Saying that there are no</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.089" end="00:54:48.798" style="s2">Unassailable truths that part of a good education is any previous generations truth should be assailed at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.109" end="00:54:50.700" style="s2">intellectually by the students they should</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.700" end="00:54:57.230" style="s2">challenge question and look at those truths what the best arguments can be amounted against them and then make their own judgments about</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.509" end="00:55:04.969" style="s2">Whether they agree that this truth is in fact a truth or whether it needs to be rejected and and moved on</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.279" end="00:55:08.839" style="s2">so the great danger I think of post-modernism though is its</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.900" end="00:55:14.690" style="s2">skeptical stance toward the idea of there being truth at all and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.240" end="00:55:17.240" style="s2">then in its activist</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.369" end="00:55:25.159" style="s2">manifestation when the professors are functioning as I just have my subjective preferences and I have power in the classroom and my</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.799" end="00:55:32.389" style="s2">View as a professor of my practice rather as a professor is simply to indoctrinate students in my subjective preferences</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.700" end="00:55:37.220" style="s2">in that case what you are doing is not only giving students a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.740" end="00:55:39.059" style="s2">cynical</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.059" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">Negative ultimately as a negative empty view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:50.059" style="s2">But you are not at all training them in the ability to think for themselves to compare competing viewpoints and make their own judgment</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.059" end="00:55:53.269" style="s2">So that&#39;s the danger right? Well, I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:57.350" style="s2">Should I should reconsider my</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.900" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">Use of the word. I&#39;m a saleable. I I&#39;m thinking more</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.540" style="s2">I was thinking more I supposed clinically in some sense unit</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.820" end="00:56:13.219" style="s2">My experience has been that you don&#39;t have to scratch very deeply beneath the surface of people&#39;s lives right until you find</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:15.270" style="s2">And I know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.270" end="00:56:20.629" style="s2">They&#39;re dealing with and so I don&#39;t know. I know you&#39;re not saying this big from the students perspective</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.630" end="00:56:27.860" style="s2">It can&#39;t be that Professor Peterson with all of his years of experience and wisdom has announced that this is a truth therefore</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.860" end="00:56:33.799" style="s2">It&#39;s a truth. They have to go through the process that you went through. Hopefully you can accelerate that process</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.010" end="00:56:38.270" style="s2">For them, but they have to go through that process. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.270" end="00:56:45.560" style="s2">well, I mean I do that in the lectures by telling stories to and and and illustrating the fact that you know, the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.230" end="00:56:49.369" style="s2">limitations that are placed on us that produce</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:56.119" style="s2">Suffering and I invite people I would say to draw their own conclusions about how they regard</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.369" end="00:56:58.819" style="s2">that reality in their own lives and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.580" end="00:57:05.719" style="s2">the second proposition let&#39;s say is that the suffering is often made worse by</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:08.959" style="s2">Malevolence and that can be while this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.560" end="00:57:14.810" style="s2">What would you say impersonal malevolence of nature or the more personal</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.210" end="00:57:20.389" style="s2">malevolence of society or the individual and so we&#39;re faced with that set of problems that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.150" end="00:57:24.950" style="s2">that vulnerability that&#39;s characteristic of existence and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:33.139" style="s2">that that vulnerability because it constitutes a real set of problems calls to us to generate solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.390" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">It&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:39.889" style="s2">Attempt to generate solutions that that adventure that you described earlier</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.830" end="00:57:46.279" style="s2">seems to me to manifest itself and so it seems reasonable to me to</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.250" end="00:57:51.050" style="s2">to suggest to young people that they do have a destiny that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.840" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">gives their life</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:58.820" style="s2">significant individual import and that is to take arms up against the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.180" end="00:58:02.180" style="s2">inequities of existence at</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.460" end="00:58:07.850" style="s2">Whatever levels they counted to act forthrightly and courageously to minimize unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.280" end="00:58:15.800" style="s2">suffering and to constrain malevolence and that and that it&#39;s also it is also actually a vital importance that they do that because</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.230" end="00:58:17.310" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.310" end="00:58:20.330" style="s2">their failure to do so is</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.150" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">more damaging than their than they think</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.780" end="00:58:29.150" style="s2">They&#39;re not ilysm and cynicism that might entice them into</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.710" end="00:58:33.949" style="s2">Nihilistic and destructive acts themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.650" end="00:58:39.650" style="s2">Actively is more destructive than they think and their capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.770" end="00:58:43.910" style="s2">positive things in the world on a large scale</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.760" end="00:58:52.760" style="s2">individually and in their family and in their community is much larger than they think I it&#39;s very difficult for me to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:55.230" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.230" end="00:58:58.730" style="s2">Young people cannot can be left</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.400" end="00:59:02.479" style="s2">Uninformed of that as at least a potential reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.940" end="00:59:09.020" style="s2">without falling down the rabbit hole of nihilism and cynicism and subjectivism and relativism that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.810" end="00:59:15.049" style="s2">Seems to me to the be at least one of the primary dangers of post-modernism. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.450" end="00:59:21.439" style="s2">Yeah, I think undred percent on the latter part of what you were saying. I think on the should be an open question initially</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.140" end="00:59:26.689" style="s2">Yes, there is suffering in the world. Yes. There is malevolence in the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.930" end="00:59:35.270" style="s2">But we should also be open to the fact that there is pleasure. There is beauty there is romance</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.970" end="00:59:37.970" style="s2">There is adventure</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.010" end="00:59:42.800" style="s2">there is genuine love in the world and what proportions of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">Benevolence versus malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:49.580" style="s2">happiness versus suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.190" end="00:59:55.070" style="s2">Possible and natural to human beings that should be part of the conversation early on</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.290" end="01:00:00.739" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an appropriate initial start. Go ahead your tools. I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.840" end="01:00:03.919" style="s2">That&#39;s a conversation about the potency of your tools</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:11.630" style="s2">like you can you can admit that these fundamental limitations exist, but you don&#39;t have to draw the conclusion that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.550" end="01:00:16.550" style="s2">Constraining in any oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.540" end="01:00:24.409" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s not just about the tools it&#39;s also about the nature of reality that we are confronting there are of course</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.930" end="01:00:29.990" style="s2">People who are Pollyanna sthoo have this view that the world is on our side</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.990" end="01:00:33.560" style="s2">There&#39;s a benevolent God or the forces of the universe are lined up</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.930" end="01:00:39.409" style="s2">Such that I lead a charmed life and everything will go well for me. There are people at the other end of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.930" end="01:00:46.010" style="s2">Who you know who argued the opposite the fates are against me. The gods hate me no matter what I do</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.800" end="01:00:52.820" style="s2">The forces that govern the universe will just grind me down that&#39;s got nothing to do with my toolset</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.369" end="01:00:57.049" style="s2">Initially, so to speak that&#39;s a metaphysical claim about the nature of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.720" end="01:01:00.889" style="s2">now when we do turn to the toolset if</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.530" end="01:01:05.060" style="s2">Whatever your position is along the spectrum of benevolence to malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.060" end="01:01:08.689" style="s2">There is the question about how much power I have</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.089" end="01:01:16.909" style="s2">To craft my own tools to to force myself into the kind of being that can take on life&#39;s challenges and here I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.220" end="01:01:23.060" style="s2">Post-modernism is dangerous in two important respects in my view the the most important</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.450" end="01:01:28.760" style="s2">development of education schooling parenting and so on is</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.849" end="01:01:36.709" style="s2">giving students and young people the critical thinking the rational power to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.320" end="01:01:45.049" style="s2">Understand the world to be able to conceptualize it to know how to do the experiments to analyze the results to sort out</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.330" end="01:01:52.459" style="s2">good truth claims from bullshit and so on and so all of that cognitive development that can only come from a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.800" end="01:01:55.099" style="s2">commitment to the idea that the evidence matters</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.740" end="01:01:59.300" style="s2">that doing the experiments matters that being</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.910" end="01:02:07.250" style="s2">excruciatingly, ly honest with respect to the to the the power of the arguments for and against positions that one might want to argue or</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.830" end="01:02:10.249" style="s2">Adopt, but that&#39;s absolutely important</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.250" end="01:02:16.099" style="s2">the development of a student&#39;s rational logical critical capacity is fundamentally important and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.770" end="01:02:20.780" style="s2">Post-modernism is an assault on that and what that means is that in practice students</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.780" end="01:02:25.879" style="s2">Do not develop that most important life skill and so put them out into the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.339" end="01:02:33.299" style="s2">without the tools that they need and I think they are then more likely to feel disempowered there likely to feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.730" end="01:02:36.359" style="s2">Overwhelmed and then we get the angry</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.420" end="01:02:42.060" style="s2">despairing activist type of person that we see in larger numbers now the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.390" end="01:02:47.820" style="s2">modernists are concerned ethically with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.470" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">Re-establishment of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:56.969" style="s2">genuine power at the bottom of the power hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.640" end="01:03:05.190" style="s2">Why do you think it&#39;s the case if it is the case and many commentators have made this case Jonathan Hyde among them</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.650" end="01:03:10.710" style="s2">That the doctrines that the post modernists tend to be teaching young people</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.260" end="01:03:12.849" style="s2">seem to be so</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.849" end="01:03:14.849" style="s2">Absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.190" end="01:03:17.190" style="s2">Infantilizing and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.349" end="01:03:19.349" style="s2">undermining rather than</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.619" end="01:03:22.949" style="s2">strengthening and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.220" end="01:03:26.200" style="s2">increasing resilience</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.200" end="01:03:34.020" style="s2">Is it that they&#39;re not interested at the individual level? I mean because it seems so paradoxical that these things are happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.140" end="01:03:37.829" style="s2">Yeah, a couple things on that one is</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.500" end="01:03:42.209" style="s2">That in addition to developing a person&#39;s rational capacity</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.210" end="01:03:48.540" style="s2">We do need to develop their emotional capacity life is a capacity for a great adventure for great positivity</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.540" end="01:03:53.609" style="s2">But as you emphasized there is also going to be a significant amount of pain and suffering</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.950" end="01:03:59.490" style="s2">And so what we need to do is develop our emotional capacity for handling</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.490" end="01:04:02.879" style="s2">All of that resilience is an important part of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.250" end="01:04:08.849" style="s2">One unfortunate part of the postmodern package though is that they are focusing on a very narrow</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.339" end="01:04:16.049" style="s2">range of emotions typically negative emotions and they don&#39;t see those emotions as having any connection to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.660" end="01:04:18.660" style="s2">rationality or any connection to a</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.849" end="01:04:22.139" style="s2">response to an actual objective reality out there, so</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.490" end="01:04:31.169" style="s2">The emotional life of human beings is both cramped and a mystery if you take the postmodern framework</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.780" end="01:04:39.449" style="s2">Seriously, and so I think what happens then is when those postmodern ins become teachers or professors or in a position of authority</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.839" end="01:04:42.839" style="s2">It&#39;s a large amount of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.320" end="01:04:44.400" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.400" end="01:04:48.289" style="s2">Communication that is going on, but it&#39;s going to be a negative</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.540" end="01:04:52.700" style="s2">rage focused despair focus cynical jaded focused kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.670" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">emotionalism and to the extent the students pick up on that they&#39;re going to be turned off or if they have some</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.450" end="01:05:08.299" style="s2">Predisposition toward that they just get sucked into that emotional universe better speak to Jonathan Heights point that you&#39;re raising</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.090" end="01:05:15.769" style="s2">yeah, let me just say one thing that is striking to me as I find it interesting among our public intellectuals that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.620" end="01:05:20.299" style="s2">three of the most prominent people on the public intellectual sphere</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.000" end="01:05:22.470" style="s2">Are yours?</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.470" end="01:05:24.060" style="s2">Jonathan hight and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.060" end="01:05:27.620" style="s2">Steven Pinker and all three of you are professionally</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.470" end="01:05:30.360" style="s2">psychologists I</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.360" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know think that that is accidental because</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.320" end="01:05:37.970" style="s2">what all three of you are doing in different ways is</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.580" end="01:05:46.309" style="s2">noticing that philosophy of course is a very abstract set of arguments and principles, but all of those do need to be operationalized in</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.160" end="01:05:51.889" style="s2">actual living breathing human beings and when you see how they are actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.200" end="01:05:56.419" style="s2">Operationalized in human beings a large part of what you&#39;re doing is psychology</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.180" end="01:05:59.180" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.310" end="01:06:01.310" style="s2">Not accidental that</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.530" end="01:06:03.450" style="s2">psychologists are of</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.450" end="01:06:06.950" style="s2">significant importance in the public intellectual space right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.470" end="01:06:11.929" style="s2">So to speak to Jonathan Heights point I think what he is</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.530" end="01:06:17.660" style="s2">Pointing out is that we are now into a second and third generation of postmoderns and</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.750" end="01:06:21.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a devolution in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.410" end="01:06:24.410" style="s2">intellectual quality of</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.630" end="01:06:31.369" style="s2">The movement and that makes sense because if you&#39;re first generation movement is quite skeptical and relativistic</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.370" end="01:06:35.240" style="s2">But nonetheless very educated as Roorkee</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:38.749" style="s2">Derrida Foucault leotard, especially in my view</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.270" end="01:06:40.800" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.800" end="01:06:42.800" style="s2">but the end</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.800" end="01:06:46.130" style="s2">Conclusion of their position is that we don&#39;t need to take</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.160" end="01:06:51.230" style="s2">rationality logic the quest for objectivity to seriously</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.140" end="01:06:55.190" style="s2">what will happen in the next generation then will be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.190" end="01:06:58.190" style="s2">whole Jan duration of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.230" end="01:07:04.699" style="s2">people with PhDs who don&#39;t take logic rationality in the quest for objectivity very seriously and said,</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.700" end="01:07:07.250" style="s2">They will be not developing those</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.099" end="01:07:14.659" style="s2">Skillsets at a very high level so there will be a devolution. They will be more emphasizing emotionalism</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.660" end="01:07:18.410" style="s2">There will be more emphasizing activism and then in the third generation</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.930" end="01:07:21.080" style="s2">It will be a further devolution</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.720" end="01:07:23.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.640" end="01:07:26.089" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a huge going</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">self defeating</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.460" end="01:07:34.099" style="s2">Is it simple it is? Yeah, it is. I think it is self defeating</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.890" end="01:07:42.890" style="s2">intellectually, and one of the things that people who are intellectuals who have been following the arguments for a while notice is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.890" end="01:07:48.230" style="s2">Is just a recycling of arguments that I heard five years ago ten years ago 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.230" end="01:07:53.810" style="s2">and so it becomes self-defeating in the sense that it fails to attract the ongoing interest of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.150" end="01:08:01.460" style="s2">The smart very active minded people. I think also that this is something built into human nature and this is my my great</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.550" end="01:08:06.560" style="s2">optimism with young people when they come to university, however</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:12.889" style="s2">Underprepared and damaged. They might be by their their primary and high school education</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.260" end="01:08:17.060" style="s2">They are nonetheless particularly, I think in North America still</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.150" end="01:08:24.410" style="s2">Optimistic gung-ho they believe that they can make something of their life. I said when they start going into classes</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.930" end="01:08:30.559" style="s2">Where the professors in word and action and just in their physical bearing are commuting</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.140" end="01:08:34.700" style="s2">communicating rather messages of defeatism and synthesis some</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.730" end="01:08:37.620" style="s2">students who are</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.620" end="01:08:40.129" style="s2">Psychologically healthy will just avoid those classes</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">They will go into fields that hold some promise of positivity for them</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.690" end="01:08:50.419" style="s2">It will be the character entrepreneurial fields. I&#39;m sorry they may avoid</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.089" end="01:08:55.879" style="s2">University all together. Yeah, absolutely. Sure. Yeah. So what&#39;s the point of going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.060" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">wallowing</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:03.769" style="s2">about what a victim you are or what a bad person you are because you have white skin or you&#39;re a male or whatever for</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.770" end="01:09:07.669" style="s2">Four years now, I&#39;m gonna quit University and get on with living</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.590" end="01:09:12.219" style="s2">I do think there also will be corrective mechanisms in place</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.210" end="01:09:19.900" style="s2">To some extent universities are driven by dollars and who is writing the fake checks</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.930" end="01:09:24.070" style="s2">if it&#39;s a million dollar donors when some</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.650" end="01:09:28.179" style="s2">terrible manifestation of political correctness happens at their institution</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.180" end="01:09:35.110" style="s2">They won&#39;t write the million dollar check the next year that will get noticed and that will be communicated in various ways. So</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.690" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">The you know, the universities have their problems, but I am ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.580" end="01:09:46.450" style="s2">Optimistic that they will be able to heal themselves there are market mechanisms in place to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.330" end="01:09:50.439" style="s2">So to bracket time span, okay, that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.750" end="01:09:55.990" style="s2">It&#39;s interesting that I mean, I wavered between optimism and pessimism because I feel that</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.400" end="01:10:08.799" style="s2">Postmodernists is relatively young and relatively entrenched and protected by tenure. And of course, I think tenure is a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.250" end="01:10:13.870" style="s2">But that and that they&#39;re also unbelievably good at</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.630" end="01:10:15.670" style="s2">fomenting activism</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.670" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">I mean, I think political surveys indicate that only about 4% of the general population who views that might be regarded as</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.200" end="01:10:25.730" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.730" end="01:10:27.500" style="s2">Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.500" end="01:10:32.500" style="s2">Postmodern it&#39;s it&#39;s a tiny minority likes bigger than that in the universities, but they they swing up</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.830" end="01:10:35.780" style="s2">They swing beyond their weight</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.780" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">They had absolutely they had past their weight and it&#39;s also I think because you know serious academics</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.770" end="01:10:47.380" style="s2">This is my impression. Is that serious academics really ignored the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.920" end="01:10:49.970" style="s2">Second-rate</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.970" end="01:10:54.909" style="s2">Postmodern disre or decades feeling that the arguments that they were making were</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.250" end="01:10:58.720" style="s2">weak enough so that they didn&#39;t even require a</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.980" end="01:11:04.660" style="s2">Strong rebuttal I mean even when Steven Pinker wrote his book come</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.900" end="01:11:09.639" style="s2">the blank slate, you know, I read that book and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:15.340" style="s2">That it was an interesting book, but I thought Jesus, dr. Pinker</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.190" end="01:11:21.430" style="s2">No one&#39;s believed that people are blank slates for like 30 years. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.729" end="01:11:24.729" style="s2">It seems as a biological</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.489" end="01:11:29.169" style="s2">Psychologist it just seemed to me to be observed that that case had to be even made</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.170" end="01:11:34.059" style="s2">But yeah, it&#39;s obviously right about that and I was obviously very wrong about that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.729" end="01:11:36.729" style="s2">yeah predictions are</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.249" end="01:11:39.249" style="s2">hard to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.499" end="01:11:42.099" style="s2">And I think it goes back to we need better</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.979" end="01:11:48.279" style="s2">Journalism about the demographics of higher education and what&#39;s going on there? So is it</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.010" end="01:11:56.079" style="s2">4% Is it 12% Is it 25% Then this issue you&#39;re raising about punching above their weight</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.229" end="01:11:58.840" style="s2">That does seem to be true</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.840" end="01:12:05.889" style="s2">but how much above their weight are they punching is the major problem in the classrooms, or is that a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.409" end="01:12:09.998" style="s2">You know as we know most academics don&#39;t like Mickey work</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.999" end="01:12:10.449" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.449" end="01:12:17.709" style="s2">But a significant number of the first-rate people Orrock doing their real academic work and they&#39;re trying to avoid committee work</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.019" end="01:12:19.719" style="s2">but the second and third Raiders</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.719" end="01:12:24.669" style="s2">They don&#39;t mind committee work and they see it as a vehicle to power within the university for them. Um</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.249" end="01:12:27.249" style="s2">so if the postmoderns are</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:30.039" style="s2">As we like to think 2nd or 3rd great</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.039" end="01:12:32.319" style="s2">That&#39;s a little bit unfair not all of them are</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.539" end="01:12:37.689" style="s2">But a higher percentage of them doing the important committee worked and they have a certain amount of power</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.690" end="01:12:43.869" style="s2">They&#39;re an overlooked part of the university demographics from my perspective is student life</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.449" end="01:12:45.920" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:47.920" style="s2">the residents</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.249" end="01:12:55.929" style="s2">The people who look after the residents the hall all in the entertainment and deciding what student clubs are authorized or not</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.960" end="01:12:59.919" style="s2">there&#39;s been a significant infiltration of</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.440" end="01:13:06.789" style="s2">Postmodernism in that area that&#39;s not on the academic side or only in indirect. But if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.610" end="01:13:10.809" style="s2">Orientation program and again, we need better journalism here</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.809" end="01:13:15.759" style="s2">But you find a significant number of them are devoting the whole and Torrie orientation week</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.300" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">When the first-year students are coming in two</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.510" end="01:13:28.329" style="s2">Lectures on privilege and oppression and whatever the buzzwords are that also is an important issue as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.159" end="01:13:33.159" style="s2">Chronicle of Higher Education</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.349" end="01:13:34.400" style="s2">excoriating</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.400" end="01:13:39.579" style="s2">Faculty&#39;s event occasion for producing precisely the kinds of internal</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.919" end="01:13:46.419" style="s2">University activists that are pushing exactly that kind of agenda, right? Yeah faculties of Education</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.419" end="01:13:48.489" style="s2">I do some work in philosophy of education</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.059" end="01:13:53.708" style="s2">They are all over the map but there has been a significant postmodern shift</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.499" end="01:13:58.659" style="s2">As with post-modernism being the reigning philosophy of education</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.659" end="01:14:06.429" style="s2">And then that of course that has impact not just in higher education because that&#39;s training the next generation of teachers</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.219" end="01:14:08.570" style="s2">one of my</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.570" end="01:14:09.889" style="s2">younger colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.889" end="01:14:15.248" style="s2">a man named Andrew Colgan recent PhD from Western University of Western, Ontario</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.369" end="01:14:20.799" style="s2">In his dissertation was documenting the the significant demographic</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.349" end="01:14:24.938" style="s2">shift among the Ontario high school teachers toward</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.519" end="01:14:32.559" style="s2">Basically buying into a postmodern framework and that&#39;s a going to be a very important generational shift for Ontario</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.709" end="01:14:39.128" style="s2">so what makes you like you talked about market forces and the corrective ability and</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.159" end="01:14:44.138" style="s2">and we spoke before we started this podcast about</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.679" end="01:14:47.479" style="s2">About</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.479" end="01:14:49.479" style="s2">optimistic and positive</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.609" end="01:14:57.279" style="s2">Elements my movements. I mean so well, I&#39;ve two questions for you at least before we conclude and one is</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.010" end="01:15:05.559" style="s2">You you seem optimistic and positive and and so what do you see is the route out of this and and what?</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.869" end="01:15:09.398" style="s2">What will replace it and like what&#39;s the time span?</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.979" end="01:15:11.419" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.419" end="01:15:12.519" style="s2">Yes, well</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.519" end="01:15:19.839" style="s2">I think one thing that we are noticing is an increasing number of first-rate people who are now engaging the debate within higher</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.149" end="01:15:22.659" style="s2">education so you can mention someone like</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.209" end="01:15:29.469" style="s2">Steven Pinker who&#39;s not just doing academic psychology now and said he&#39;s devoting resources to</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.229" end="01:15:33.339" style="s2">Defending in a public intellectual sphere the Enlightenment project</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.099" end="01:15:36.099" style="s2">Jonathan Haidt also excellent</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.189" end="01:15:39.969" style="s2">Psychologist doing clinical work as well</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.969" end="01:15:45.549" style="s2">But nonetheless is formative in creating that heterodox Academy bringing together</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.070" end="01:15:50.030" style="s2">Academics from a wide variety of political spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.430" end="01:15:57.919" style="s2">But the positions but nonetheless all agreeing that academic freedom free speech and so forth are important the work that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.850" end="01:16:06.799" style="s2">Stepping out onto the public space stage as well. So there is a major uptick in very good</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.380" end="01:16:08.430" style="s2">academics</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.430" end="01:16:14.539" style="s2">Taking post-modernism and its offshoots seriously and pushing back and I think that augers well</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.540" end="01:16:17.689" style="s2">I think there also is a financial</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.420" end="01:16:21.950" style="s2">Clout, I think young students when they come in they do</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:26.480" style="s2">Take a post-modernism course</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.480" end="01:16:33.500" style="s2">But they don&#39;t go back for more or they plug into the student grapevine and they learn which courses to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.380" end="01:16:36.740" style="s2">and in many cases that postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.290" end="01:16:42.410" style="s2">Activist type of professors they are really ghetto wised in marginal departments</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.510" end="01:16:44.480" style="s2">They might be outsized in their voice</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.480" end="01:16:50.540" style="s2">but they&#39;re not attracting a huge number of students and in my view the students that they are attracting are ones, who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.090" end="01:16:58.700" style="s2">Already predisposed to that. They&#39;re not necessarily converting seems to be so least invasive way of dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.660" end="01:17:03.439" style="s2">Post-modernism if it if it does have the negative</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.260" end="01:17:10.429" style="s2">attributes that we&#39;ve been discussing is actually something like a market solution which is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:17.450" style="s2">Inform young people as to it&#39;s essentially and to help convince them that there are</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:19.410" style="s2">viable</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.410" end="01:17:23.059" style="s2">alternatives like viable philosophical alternatives viable political</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.610" end="01:17:29.569" style="s2">Alternatives courses they could be taking that would enrich their lives instead of enhancing their sense of victimization</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.150" end="01:17:31.280" style="s2">Exactly. That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.280" end="01:17:34.759" style="s2">the safest route rather than political intervention or or</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.160" end="01:17:37.160" style="s2">some kind of attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.290" end="01:17:43.249" style="s2">radically change the structure of the universities which seems to more dangerous than than usable and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.760" end="01:17:47.389" style="s2">I&#39;m very gung-ho on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.390" end="01:17:53.059" style="s2">The internet of course is just a tool can be used for good or ill and there&#39;s a lot of crap as we all know</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.060" end="01:17:56.390" style="s2">On the internet, but it also is the case that young</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.910" end="01:17:58.910" style="s2">open-minded hungry students</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.100" end="01:18:05.399" style="s2">When they are at a U versity and they&#39;re not getting the education that they want. They now have access to all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.740" end="01:18:10.619" style="s2">Viewpoints and they&#39;re actively exploring them and I&#39;m sure you get hundreds of contacts</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.620" end="01:18:13.349" style="s2">I get lots of contacts from students from all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.990" end="01:18:15.190" style="s2">Who?</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.190" end="01:18:21.089" style="s2">Come to me through the internet, and I know that that&#39;s a worldwide phenomenon. I also do think</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.670" end="01:18:23.670" style="s2">That there&#39;s lots of very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.160" end="01:18:25.840" style="s2">entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.840" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">experimentation going on in higher education</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.450" end="01:18:35.519" style="s2">Some of it&#39;s driven by the cost demographics, you know people asking the reasonable question. Is it really worth a quarter million dollars?</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.640" end="01:18:40.470" style="s2">To to get a good higher education at a traditional bricks-and-mortar</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.990" end="01:18:45.089" style="s2">university or should I spend just a hundred thousand dollars and maybe get only a</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.850" end="01:18:49.499" style="s2">75% quality education at an online</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.050" end="01:18:54.779" style="s2">Institution or some other vehicle? So there&#39;s lots of experimentations that are going on there</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.780" end="01:18:58.080" style="s2">and of course the technology is just getting better and better so</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.840" end="01:18:59.920" style="s2">instead of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.920" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">the only</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:07.890" style="s2">Avenue being taking the universities on head-on from the inside that battle has to be fought and some of us are doing it but there</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.890" end="01:19:12.119" style="s2">Will be a significant number of people who will just avoid the universities altogether and they&#39;ll be new</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.250" end="01:19:17.310" style="s2">Institutions that are created and that will be a market solution. Mm-hmm. Do you know that seventy about</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.310" end="01:19:25.080" style="s2">75% of the cumulative student debt in the United States is held by women. I</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.440" end="01:19:28.440" style="s2">Did not know that</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.600" end="01:19:34.950" style="s2">Supported number of those women are black so it that it&#39;s so perverse</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.740" end="01:19:38.490" style="s2">Hmm. They&#39;re so perverse part of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.310" end="01:19:43.769" style="s2">Explanation for that. It&#39;s not the total explanation is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.310" end="01:19:47.200" style="s2">These</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.200" end="01:19:48.970" style="s2">women were</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.970" end="01:19:55.109" style="s2">Enticed or chose to enter disciplines where the probability of making enough money</p>

<p begin="01:19:58.870" end="01:20:03.809" style="s2">Especially given the high interest rates that are associated with student debt is extraordinarily low</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.480" end="01:20:06.720" style="s2">No, that&#39;s another strange</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.480" end="01:20:11.580" style="s2">Reaction as a perverse unintended consequence. Oh, I was not aware of that statistic. I was aware that</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.580" end="01:20:17.350" style="s2">This matters with my experience about 60% of our university graduates are women</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.380" end="01:20:22.870" style="s2">Compared to only about 40% male. So there&#39;s a demographic shift there. So</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.260" end="01:20:27.070" style="s2">But I was not aware of the the racial component of that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.750" end="01:20:31.000" style="s2">Intended consequence</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.000" end="01:20:32.800" style="s2">It&#39;s really what you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.800" end="01:20:38.410" style="s2">Because there&#39;s poor women laboring under these debt loads that it looks like they&#39;re never going to be able to clear</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.780" end="01:20:43.090" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s that&#39;s optimism. It&#39;s long term optimism, but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.140" end="01:20:50.410" style="s2">That&#39;s good to hear can I ask you a little bit about what your private</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.030" end="01:20:57.050" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.050" end="01:20:58.130" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.130" end="01:21:01.150" style="s2">Social media more and as your work has become</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.940" end="01:21:03.940" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.190" end="01:21:06.759" style="s2">Disseminated and discussed publicly. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.430" end="01:21:11.769" style="s2">Pluses and the minuses for you and what&#39;s changed for you? Yeah overall</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.470" end="01:21:13.490" style="s2">plusses</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.490" end="01:21:15.729" style="s2">A way the minuses definitely</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.250" end="01:21:23.890" style="s2">Whether the mean- has been that it&#39;s cut a lot into my writing time in some ways. Majorly. I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.530" end="01:21:26.530" style="s2">stereotypical nerd my</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.230" end="01:21:32.680" style="s2">ideal day is to go to the library with my computer and read and write with a stack of books and</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.380" end="01:21:34.550" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.550" end="01:21:37.990" style="s2">Envision my professors life as being dominated by that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.360" end="01:21:43.480" style="s2">But certainly for the last couple of years my my writing and thinking time has been has been lessened</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.150" end="01:21:47.379" style="s2">the other major negative just has been they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:54.970" style="s2">just the crap you have to put up with with people who are on various hobby horses who disagree with you, but who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.580" end="01:21:57.580" style="s2">social skills or the</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.650" end="01:22:00.339" style="s2">to know how to have a fruitful discussion so</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.740" end="01:22:06.729" style="s2">They send to you ad hominem emails and just resort to insults because you you disagree with them</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.820" end="01:22:13.420" style="s2">so there&#39;s been a certain steady stream of that but part of my learning curve has driven just to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.760" end="01:22:17.470" style="s2">ignore that or filter that out and focus on the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.080" end="01:22:23.019" style="s2">The positive responses and and the critical responses that are raising good questions. I</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.660" end="01:22:29.229" style="s2">Did want to mention if I can plug I have an open college podcast series and I&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.469" end="01:22:36.939" style="s2">Podcasts in the work where I&#39;m taking up the the serious and in some cases good criticisms that have been raised of my work</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.250" end="01:22:40.419" style="s2">So I&#39;m I&#39;m working on on those as well</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.090" end="01:22:43.090" style="s2">That&#39;s just part of the ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.239" end="01:22:48.489" style="s2">Fun scholarly back-and-forth that that should be going on and</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.310" end="01:22:51.080" style="s2">while I am down on</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.080" end="01:22:53.439" style="s2">Post-modernism I should say that I do think</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.320" end="01:22:56.320" style="s2">It&#39;s an important part of any person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.870" end="01:23:01.450" style="s2">education to at least for some time consider the most skeptical and</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.790" end="01:23:08.319" style="s2">Nihilistic arguments that are out there that post-modernism should have a seat at the table in any person&#39;s education</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.860" end="01:23:11.860" style="s2">And so it really should be a three or four-way</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.440" end="01:23:18.009" style="s2">Debate that&#39;s going on there and and students need to process those arguments for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.620" end="01:23:19.670" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.670" end="01:23:22.029" style="s2">Other pluses are that I do enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.550" end="01:23:25.989" style="s2">travel so in addition to my normal academic</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.810" end="01:23:28.610" style="s2">conferencing and academic lectures</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.610" end="01:23:36.009" style="s2">I&#39;ve been giving some public intellectual lectures and interacting with the general public more thinking public and that&#39;s been a lot of fun</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.010" end="01:23:38.010" style="s2">It&#39;s actually been very encouraging to realize</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.780" end="01:23:40.780" style="s2">How many smart?</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.940" end="01:23:45.370" style="s2">Knowledgeable people there are out there in the world living full lives</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.820" end="01:23:54.100" style="s2">doing very interesting things, but they also have an interest in intellectual matters and you can have a very fond this conversation with them about</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.650" end="01:23:56.650" style="s2">Nietzsche or Marx or</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.900" end="01:23:59.469" style="s2">the current state of higher education, so I found that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.170" end="01:24:06.910" style="s2">The the the tourism part that comes with the travel and just interacting with people that I never would have interacted to be very pleasurable</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.460" end="01:24:10.569" style="s2">the other big plus has been since I am a</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.360" end="01:24:17.620" style="s2">professor I just love young students in their first second year of university when they realize</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.050" end="01:24:23.860" style="s2">How big the intellectual world is and how exciting it can be that when they come alive intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.620" end="01:24:29.680" style="s2">And then having a lot more students from around the world who will email me or Facebook me?</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.350" end="01:24:32.379" style="s2">with very interesting questions or</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.900" end="01:24:40.390" style="s2">They have their own podcast and when I can I&#39;ll have a you know, 45 or 50 minute conversation with them on their podcast</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.940" end="01:24:42.200" style="s2">so if</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.200" end="01:24:49.389" style="s2">Interacting with a lot more students from other parts of the world than than I otherwise would have so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.390" end="01:24:51.260" style="s2">We&#39;ll roll the pluses have been great</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.260" end="01:24:58.389" style="s2">The thing is about the public exposure and the social media exposure that it&#39;s so interesting. Is that come?</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.470" end="01:25:06.429" style="s2">The people who come to listen to you only come because they want to listen to you hmm</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.760" end="01:25:14.050" style="s2">it&#39;s really part of it&#39;s a real pure form of the university because there&#39;s no compulsion as there is with say</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.240" end="01:25:18.579" style="s2">Mandatory classes and grades and so on in universities is that that&#39;s right there</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.580" end="01:25:22.149" style="s2">Is this tremendous public hunger for philosophical discourse?</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.340" end="01:25:29.019" style="s2">That&#39;s really been completely in some sense undiscovered up until now and it&#39;s it&#39;s not an asset</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.270" end="01:25:31.810" style="s2">That&#39;s right. And that&#39;s why I think optimistically</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.450" end="01:25:36.490" style="s2">I am or ultimately I am optimistic because I think it is built into</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.160" end="01:25:41.260" style="s2">Human nature to to want to be vigorous to engage with the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.260" end="01:25:49.119" style="s2">and since we&#39;re such a smart species to engage with the world intellectually, so young people in their teens when they are becoming</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.810" end="01:25:57.189" style="s2">More fully aware of themselves as independent of their parents and that their whole life is ahead and they&#39;re preparing for life</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.190" end="01:25:59.190" style="s2">they do have this hunger and</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.510" end="01:26:01.780" style="s2">It&#39;s beautiful to see it activated</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.200" end="01:26:04.910" style="s2">Yeah, obviously</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.910" end="01:26:08.079" style="s2">all the controversy that surrounded your work hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.720" end="01:26:16.659" style="s2">Soured you in the least on the intellectual enterprise. It sounds like quite the contrary. What are you working on now?</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.780" end="01:26:22.780" style="s2">Next five years. That&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.690" end="01:26:28.960" style="s2">Missions what I&#39;ve carved out in my schedule starting the end of this academic year</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.570" end="01:26:31.190" style="s2">mid May a</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.190" end="01:26:38.200" style="s2">Significant amount more of writing time and so I&#39;m I&#39;m making progress and I&#39;m optimistic that by the end of this calendar year</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.210" end="01:26:42.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll be almost on this next book. What I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.430" end="01:26:51.039" style="s2">Focusing on the positive the post-modernism book is negative the Nietzsche and the Nazis book is negative going into some dark philosophical and political</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.410" end="01:26:53.150" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.150" end="01:26:56.890" style="s2">but the to put it positively what are the</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.620" end="01:27:01.809" style="s2">positive philosophical issues and positions that need to be developed to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.110" end="01:27:09.219" style="s2">reinvigorate the Enlightenment to correct its deficiencies to make people realize</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.860" end="01:27:12.639" style="s2">that the postmodern arguments are</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.430" end="01:27:16.090" style="s2">powerful, but they&#39;re powerfully based on some</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.760" end="01:27:20.499" style="s2">often easy philosophical issues or mistakes to make</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.350" end="01:27:24.189" style="s2">Very subtle. So my value added is as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.370" end="01:27:27.370" style="s2">The way I&#39;m going to impart package</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.370" end="01:27:34.479" style="s2">This is to say that we do have huge debates along any number of dimensions about politics and so on</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.850" end="01:27:41.140" style="s2">but in fact, most of our debates about politics are not at all about politics, they are about underlying</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.260" end="01:27:49.090" style="s2">Philosophical issues. So for example, we&#39;re having debates right now about the proper political</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.670" end="01:27:51.729" style="s2">status of say transgender</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.550" end="01:28:00.249" style="s2">Individuals, but we&#39;re spending very little time actually talking about the politics of it instead. We are having arguments about human nature and</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.220" end="01:28:03.220" style="s2">to what extent things are fixed</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.010" end="01:28:06.880" style="s2">Causally into a extent things are a matter of human volition</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.520" end="01:28:11.979" style="s2">what things are subjective what things are objective and so on and so</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.680" end="01:28:14.420" style="s2">Really we are having</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.420" end="01:28:15.530" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.530" end="01:28:19.389" style="s2">Arguments hopefully philosophical arguments. It should be informed by biology</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.730" end="01:28:25.270" style="s2">but even that is itself a philosophical debate because some people want to say we should approach this as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.060" end="01:28:31.840" style="s2">Scientific method type of question look at the facts look at the experiments and others have a more free-floating</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.480" end="01:28:35.590" style="s2">Ideological commitment that is to say they&#39;re operating on a different</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.320" end="01:28:39.939" style="s2">epistemology so really what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re having a debate about</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.120" end="01:28:47.470" style="s2">Epistemology and human nature not really debates about politics so that the politics is just a manifestation of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.500" end="01:28:49.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.760" end="01:28:51.080" style="s2">then my</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.080" end="01:28:57.970" style="s2">Hopeful professional value added is to bring clarity and some fresh perspectives on on</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.850" end="01:29:04.390" style="s2">On those philosophical debates, one of the things that has plagued lost. Sorry. I&#39;ll just say one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.390" end="01:29:07.419" style="s2">It has played philosophy as a whole number</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.300" end="01:29:12.100" style="s2">false alternatives that have been entrenched in the discipline for</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.920" end="01:29:14.920" style="s2">generations and in many cases</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.650" end="01:29:17.650" style="s2">If you can notice</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.130" end="01:29:25.390" style="s2">- apparently opposed arguments but realize they have a shared premise and in often cases that shared premise is</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.670" end="01:29:27.670" style="s2">implicit then</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.710" end="01:29:33.850" style="s2">Asking what the alternatives to that implicit premise would be once you make it explicit can be very illuminating</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.850" end="01:29:40.359" style="s2">So I&#39;m working that territory a lot. Hmm. Well, it&#39;s interesting. You know that maybe one of the consequences is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.940" end="01:29:42.860" style="s2">out of them</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.860" end="01:29:44.750" style="s2">Let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.750" end="01:29:48.069" style="s2">rather murky darkness of moral relativism and</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.160" end="01:29:54.999" style="s2">Post-modernism and the claim that power is the fundamental motivation of human beings. I mean, these are very</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.000" end="01:29:57.560" style="s2">pessimistic</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.560" end="01:29:59.270" style="s2">philosophical statements</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.270" end="01:30:01.270" style="s2">taken almost - almost</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.580" end="01:30:09.189" style="s2">Dudes think - they&#39;re logical extreme. Hmm. Maybe what will happen is that out of that will come something like a</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.340" end="01:30:12.340" style="s2">philosophy, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.350" end="01:30:15.399" style="s2">genuinely optimistic without being naive</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.760" end="01:30:18.760" style="s2">Exactly. That&#39;s nicely put I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:21.430" style="s2">reminded of a line from the Roman</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.130" end="01:30:29.770" style="s2">poet Horace who was reflecting on some of the skeptical and nihilistic trends of his time where they were</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.470" end="01:30:33.339" style="s2">Denying the natural world denying and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.190" end="01:30:36.190" style="s2">then a lion is</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.320" end="01:30:39.279" style="s2">Though you drive nature out with a pitchfork</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.920" end="01:30:45.489" style="s2">Ever she will return right? So the optimistic return is is what we&#39;re working on now</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.070" end="01:30:50.739" style="s2">Right well and there does seem to be I would say a tremendous hunger for that, you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.739" end="01:30:55.029" style="s2">one of the things why and I&#39;m sure you see this in your teaching is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.670" end="01:30:57.819" style="s2">It it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.700" end="01:31:01.539" style="s2">you know, I I usually begin my lectures on a</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.239" end="01:31:07.749" style="s2">fairly pessimistic note, you know detailing out the problems of human nature and</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.690" end="01:31:14.859" style="s2">society and to some degree the natural world trying to make a vicious case for the for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.860" end="01:31:18.700" style="s2">in some sense the atrocity of life and</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.330" end="01:31:25.840" style="s2">It means that there&#39;s nothing hidden in some sense when the argument begins and then I</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.180" end="01:31:29.440" style="s2">Try to make a case that despite that you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.440" end="01:31:36.250" style="s2">We have within us the capacity to transcend that and then that capacity to transcend that</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.310" end="01:31:40.929" style="s2">the atrocity of life is actually more powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.180" end="01:31:48.190" style="s2">Then you can derive an optimism out of the pessimism out of the pessimism. That&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.710" end="01:31:53.710" style="s2">Optimistic because of the depth of the pessimism, you know, I can you could tell students</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.710" end="01:31:59.980" style="s2">Look you guys you&#39;ve got real problems to deal with it&#39;s no wonder that you&#39;re suffering from the existential</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.010" end="01:32:05.949" style="s2">Dilemmas that you&#39;re suffering from they&#39;re real. Hmm, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.830" end="01:32:11.860" style="s2">Set of viable solutions and maybe a very large set of viable solutions that can be</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.320" end="01:32:16.690" style="s2">that you can learn and that you can practice and that you can engage in that make a</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.910" end="01:32:23.260" style="s2">genuine difference to your life and a genuine difference to the life of the people around you and that this is even more real than</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.630" end="01:32:26.230" style="s2">the reality of the relativism in them</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.990" end="01:32:29.980" style="s2">and the nihilism and and the pessimism and</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.970" end="01:32:36.159" style="s2">I&#39;ve been aligning that especially with the idea of responsibility. You know that</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.920" end="01:32:42.069" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to find the sustaining meaning in your life through the adoption of a</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.980" end="01:32:44.180" style="s2">substantive</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.180" end="01:32:47.680" style="s2">responsibility as you can manage and it&#39;s really quite remarkable how</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.530" end="01:32:54.400" style="s2">Ready people are for that idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.120" end="01:32:59.650" style="s2">Reduces the audience&#39;s to silence to speak of that</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.230" end="01:33:07.149" style="s2">Yeah, well, that&#39;s all of that touching on the profound themes that human beings do need to engage with</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.670" end="01:33:13.359" style="s2">My approach is typically a different particularly with my my first-year students. Where am I?</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.200" end="01:33:18.010" style="s2">Reading of them is a lot of them are coming into</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.770" end="01:33:21.879" style="s2">University feeling somewhat constrained sometimes they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.400" end="01:33:28.750" style="s2">University because they have to be in university or they have the sense that their lives are largely</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.420" end="01:33:37.209" style="s2">predetermined or that things have been mapped out either by their parents or expectation of certain social horses or whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.969" end="01:33:41.979" style="s2">Getting them to see that the world is a lot more open</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.620" end="01:33:47.949" style="s2">To them. There are a lot more possibilities than that. They have more power to shape their own</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.770" end="01:33:51.999" style="s2">destinies than they otherwise might have been taught so</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.270" end="01:34:00.790" style="s2">higher education has transformative in the sense of of liberating them from constraints that they</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.750" end="01:34:04.750" style="s2">Felt themselves to be put in</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.750" end="01:34:07.750" style="s2">And I found that that has been</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.969" end="01:34:13.059" style="s2">Useful in tapping into the hunger that we are both talking about because that can be suppressed</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.310" end="01:34:15.640" style="s2">but once they get a taste of it that in fact</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.739" end="01:34:22.689" style="s2">they are free agents that the world is a lot more open-ended than other people might have been telling them they they</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.060" end="01:34:27.789" style="s2">They start to drink it up. Well, that was very exciting University for me</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.860" end="01:34:28.940" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.940" end="01:34:35.890" style="s2">I came from a small town and went to increasingly large universities and every time I made a transition</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.920" end="01:34:40.960" style="s2">Vince that the world was opening up to me continue to increase</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.630" end="01:34:46.630" style="s2">In a part, that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.140" end="01:34:52.779" style="s2">Makes post-modernism unsettling because it really is a cramped intellectual vision</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.150" end="01:34:56.620" style="s2">But it also tends to put people into smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.670" end="01:35:04.330" style="s2">Categories or you&#39;re only a member of this group and you&#39;re an exemple are of it</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.489" end="01:35:08.109" style="s2">and your identity has been shaped by forces beyond your control and</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.659" end="01:35:13.479" style="s2">You can&#39;t engage with other cultures and other individuals except on the basis of hostility</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.480" end="01:35:18.549" style="s2">Which just means people retrench so it&#39;s a very closing in kind of intellectual movement</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.550" end="01:35:22.659" style="s2">so there the the optimism and the the romance and the adventure in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.850" end="01:35:28.479" style="s2">You can in fact take charge of your own life and make yourself and the world a better place</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.929" end="01:35:33.219" style="s2">That&#39;s the point that we need to emphasize. But of course, it can&#39;t be a naive one</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.230" end="01:35:37.569" style="s2">So we do need better intellectual tools for that. Well, I do think students to</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.780" end="01:35:43.210" style="s2">always love teaching undergraduates is because even those who are</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.940" end="01:35:45.940" style="s2">Who have that?</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.040" end="01:35:48.040" style="s2">brittle and</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.550" end="01:35:50.840" style="s2">Thin-skinned</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.840" end="01:35:53.290" style="s2">cynicism sort of the prematurely</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.110" end="01:35:55.310" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.310" end="01:35:57.290" style="s2">intellectually hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.290" end="01:35:59.290" style="s2">however II thought this</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.900" end="01:36:01.900" style="s2">dynamism of youth that</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.120" end="01:36:04.120" style="s2">wants exactly</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.370" end="01:36:06.370" style="s2">That call to adventure</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.500" end="01:36:09.100" style="s2">Exists and that they will respond</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.739" end="01:36:11.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.000" end="01:36:16.870" style="s2">Unbelievable enthusiasm, I agree entirely. That&#39;s right. Yeah - any message that puts</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.540" end="01:36:21.219" style="s2">That idea across in a believable manner and that takes them seriously</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.949" end="01:36:25.389" style="s2">The other thing that struck me - that it&#39;s really saddening</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.000" end="01:36:30.669" style="s2">you know, I&#39;ve talked to hundreds of people after my lectures now and</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.510" end="01:36:35.620" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s almost inconceivable</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.610" end="01:36:39.730" style="s2">The degree to which people are</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.340" end="01:36:42.340" style="s2">starving for encouragement</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.380" end="01:36:49.089" style="s2">How little they get and how little it takes to make a massive difference in their life just to say, you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.090" end="01:36:51.610" style="s2">You are a sovereign individual of</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.699" end="01:36:58.929" style="s2">Divine value that you&#39;re the cornerstone of the community and and and that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.690" end="01:37:02.799" style="s2">presupposition of our society that happens to be true and that you</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.960" end="01:37:10.149" style="s2">Can put your life together with truth and courage and things will work out better and even more importantly than that</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.550" end="01:37:13.420" style="s2">Whether it works out or not, even more importantly than that</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.060" end="01:37:20.649" style="s2">That is the adventure and destiny of your life and it actually matters and people are sewing</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.140" end="01:37:23.680" style="s2">Dyeing they&#39;re dying for that idea</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.620" end="01:37:27.729" style="s2">Yep, that&#39;s beautifully put so thanks for saying that</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.210" end="01:37:33.759" style="s2">Well, look, I&#39;d like to know when you put up those podcasts that</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.489" end="01:37:37.179" style="s2">respond to the criticisms of your book</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.000" end="01:37:42.910" style="s2">So if you would be kind enough to let me know that I&#39;ll be happy to do so</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.910" end="01:37:50.169" style="s2">I would I would love to publicize them. It might be an opportunity again for us to have another conversation</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.880" end="01:37:59.679" style="s2">Because I&#39;m very interested in the criticisms, you know, because I relied on your book a fair bit in my discussion of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.730" end="01:38:04.389" style="s2">It&#39;s not an area of expertise of mine</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.389" end="01:38:10.899" style="s2">You know, I was one of those academics who tended to ignore it not entirely but while I was pursuing my own studies</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.900" end="01:38:12.900" style="s2">but your book was extremely useful and</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.309" end="01:38:15.229" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.229" end="01:38:21.219" style="s2">Necessarily the case that because I&#39;m not as philosophically versed as I might be that I can</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.429" end="01:38:28.899" style="s2">Evaluate all the criticisms and so I would definitely like to know more about that and to know more about you respond</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.900" end="01:38:34.779" style="s2">So, please do let me know. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me again. I always find that</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.510" end="01:38:37.510" style="s2">extremely illuminating</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.670" end="01:38:42.939" style="s2">Right, I appreciate the invitation and spending time with you as well. It&#39;s good fun</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.239" end="01:38:50.379" style="s2">Great-grand important. Oh, good luck. Good luck with your ambitions and I wish you</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.110" end="01:38:56.889" style="s2">even more success in the public domain because I think that what you&#39;re doing is extremely helpful and</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.800" end="01:39:00.159" style="s2">Well, thank you. Yeah, you too. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.519" end="01:39:09.219" style="s2">The regard is mutual. Absolutely. All right. Well, hopefully we&#39;ll have a chance to meet at some point in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.949" end="01:39:11.749" style="s2">not-too-distant future</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.749" end="01:39:13.309" style="s2">Perfect</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.309" end="01:39:15.339" style="s2">Very good to see you. You too</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.999" end="01:39:18.999" style="s2">Bye for now. Bye bye</p>
