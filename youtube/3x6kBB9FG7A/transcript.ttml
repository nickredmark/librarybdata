<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">yeah so let&#39;s talk about palladium so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">the basic thesis of palladium</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">is that america is in rough shape</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">politically and ideologically and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">and we conceived of the project</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">as a way to start changing that as a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">a little corner in the discourse where</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">it is possible to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">things frankly and at a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">create a community of people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">can hopefully help contribute as</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">we get through the next couple decades</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">trouble uh so the basic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">historical thesis is we&#39;re reaching the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">of kind of a period of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">stability complacency um</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">and and we&#39;re entering into kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">period of perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">more chaos and decay and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">natural cycle within any complex system</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">you have things built up and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">decay</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">and the way uh that we have to approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">these things as historical actors</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">is that we have to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">ways to detach from the stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">and build new things that isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">be dragged down so if you think of it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">terms of winter and spring</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">in the winter in the fall there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">generally a bunch of things decaying but</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">there are also</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">seeds being sown and then in the spring</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">things come back</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">up so that&#39;s kind of a very metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">way to describe what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">trying to sow the seeds of new growth</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">in civilization and social technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">and particular america&#39;s institutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">early in this period of what we expect</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">a lot of change so what we do to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">accomplish that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">is we publish as peter was saying we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">publish long form</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">we publish analysis of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">going on in the world we publish</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">analysis of things that are going on in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to kind of take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">philosophical long-term</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">relatively realist approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">to what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">and we summarize this as we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">produce navigation grade information</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">for the people who are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">future institution buildings</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">um so you know you need to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">world you need to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">going on well enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">navigate it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">and a lot of the kind of currently</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">existing media</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">the mainstream doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">always provide that for you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">time it&#39;s narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to suck you into a political</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">thing um</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s operating within established</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">paradigms which are what actually is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">failing so we&#39;re trying to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">established paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">look at things with fresh eyes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">the first aspect the second aspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to provide fresh visions</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">in particular visions for a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">if we&#39;re thinking about who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">making decisions in society it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">people with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">most power so we try to approach these</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">questions from the first person so to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">speak of like well what would</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">what should an elite be interested in um</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">and so we try to build visions for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">where we should be taking society from</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">from that perspective of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">govern a society well and responsibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">and so this um this produces kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">concept of governance futurism</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">and then additionally we have a third</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">pillar of the project which</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">is the community we think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">one of the most important and high</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">leverage ways to impact history and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">and impact the way things are going into</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">society is to build networks</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">with uh a lot of talented people the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">young talented ambitious people</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">with um a particular way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">the world and so what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">is build a network around our project of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">people who are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">really dissecting these political</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">problems that we&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">and these social problems and and coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">up with productive</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">answers to them not necessarily in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">short term like policy and so on but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">the longer term vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">and understanding so and and our</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">expectation and our hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">is that by building this community we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">will help positively contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">um our our</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">society&#39;s development over the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">couple or sorry the the next couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">decades where i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">such people will hopefully will be at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">high premium and hopefully we&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">to provide some of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s the overall pitch for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">project um and that&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.560" style="s2">background for</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">why we do what we do which is again as</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.560" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">peter was saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">long form publishing analysis vision</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">that kind of stuff so i&#39;ll turn it over</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">to ash to fill in some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">yeah thanks wolf so you know as wolf was</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">laid out very well there we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">looking at things not from an sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">abstract perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">or you could even say from an objective</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">because when you&#39;re looking at the sorts</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">of stories we&#39;re covering</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">alternative governance models or</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">development or power elites thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">about something or</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">why have institutional failures occurred</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">these are not stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">that you can just kind of look at from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">bird&#39;s eye view as if you&#39;re not part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">the story that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">um one of the things that we in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">particular did early on that helped</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:57.199" style="s2">bootstrap the publication</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">was on the ground coverage we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.199" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">an excellent piece done very early on in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">the project about xinjiang</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">uh and the camps for uyghurs and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">situation in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">uh cities in that region there uh we had</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">people report to us about the yellow</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">vest protest in france</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">about the protest in chile um kazakhstan</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">and some of the interesting stuff going</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">on there basically in all these cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to identify who are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">institution builders</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">and who are the i know samuel comes on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">this thing a lot so let&#39;s see the live</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">uh involved in these stories and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">you know on the one hand uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">there is an event that goes on in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">world right now we have a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">um it has been the event maybe now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">becoming the setting for other events</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">protests mass evictions and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">but uh within that setting there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">people who are responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">to some degree for things going on in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve looked at pieces that have just</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">institutional failure in a very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">we&#39;re not interested in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">we want to know who did or did fail to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">uh who built the institution when it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">working why is it no longer working</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s like the lens through which we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">kind of view</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">all of the things we cover uh the china</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">bead card events and so on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">um we have as i&#39;m sure a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">more recently moved into doing salons as</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">um and there we try to talk to some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">the most interesting people</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">um who are actually building</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">institutions or projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">doing insightful analysis today so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">had vitalik buterin on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">uh john tallinn uh michael lind recently</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">who&#39;s the best-selling author has</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">interesting work on</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">the new class for and class analysis uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">so covering a range of topics here</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">basically we&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">in people who are actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">figure out how the world works</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">and are putting skin in the game right</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">uh either providing analysis</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">or building something uh ideally</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">that is based on the assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">their analysis is correct</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">because you know this is in a way uh how</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">you know you could trust someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">um overall uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">our coalescing together</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say of narrative long-form and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">analysis seems to have gone over</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">pretty well it&#39;s i i think something</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">that&#39;s getting people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">either thought of politics as something</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t impact them</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">i think especially in the tech sector</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of assumption that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">can just escape</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">you know decentralize or or build some</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">kind of a blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">and then you can ignore the hard work of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">politics or</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">institution building um i you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">think this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">illusion is ever more starting to fade</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">and being based in san francisco as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">project uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">that you know i proud to say a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">the work we&#39;ve done has helped</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">add to that i just want to add to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">something peter said though so i&#39;m based</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">um perhaps there&#39;s other people here</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">also based in the city</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">and as i&#39;m here i&#39;m starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">interesting convergences between these</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">toronto has a lot of um ties</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">in a way to the bay area people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">know this but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">the original research on deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">on ai and other issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">occurred in this city and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">seen ever more institutional ties</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">growing between these two cities</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s made me interested in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">about where else in america what other</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">cities are starting to learn from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">bay area</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">maybe in ways that are imperceptible uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">palladium&#39;s lens does come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">bay area subculture in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">right we&#39;re trying not to just fill up</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">some pre-established</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">position on the political spectrum we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">interested in substance</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">given that the bay area seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">having cultural impact</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">in other cities this gives me some hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">that the kind of analysis palladium is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">will also start increasingly to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">capture the imaginations of people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">are trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">uh do something useful or understand the</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">outside of one ecosystem so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">project that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">you know we&#39;re looking at uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">at north america as a whole really um</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe just some sketching around</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">uh the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">finer details of what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">why we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">um i know that we kind of wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">touch on a couple issues that are of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">relevance or interest to us at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">moment uh wolf</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">you want to know some stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">elite education and culture so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">yeah cool thanks ash um</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">one way to follow on what ash was just</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">saying about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">kind of the west coast and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">the cultural project</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">uh in a way of of sort of the bay area</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">extended culture and the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">project of palladium</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">and connect that to the elite formation</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">issue is</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">uh we think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">yeah we think there&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">important happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">on the west coast in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">ability to think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">uh think in new ways and think new</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">that isn&#39;t just in the established</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">and so one of the big issues that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">focus on domestically</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">in america is how does the elite think</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">how do they think about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">um how do they educate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">how basically how are we running this</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">right or or this this continent really i</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">there&#39;s so so this is one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">central issues that we&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">interested in what i think our most</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">sort of popular and well-known article</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">in this vein was</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">natalia deshawn&#39;s article the real</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">uh the kind of culture of elites</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">of elite self-conception at elite</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">kind of less privileged than they</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">right now and that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">of the big problems that we want to look</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">at is like okay there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">you you need an elite in society you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">always have an elite there&#39;s always some</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">relatively smaller group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">holds the preponderance of power</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">and how those people think and operate</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">is of supreme importance and if they</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in right now so this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">one of the dimensions along which</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">we we sort of orient our work we we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">so there&#39;s a bunch of these aspects that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at that&#39;s kind of like our</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">domestic</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">our major domestic project is what</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">should the american league</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">elite be thinking like and how are they</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">thinking and i&#39;ll leave it at that i i</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">issues that we&#39;re faced with but</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">ash go for go add your part to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">yeah you know so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">kind of touching off the global</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">counterpart of what wolf was just</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">um one of the main focuses</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">of palladium from the start has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">this idea that we&#39;re living in a time</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">when governance model there is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">a monopoly on models of governance</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">uh you know i personally this has always</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">been a fascinating thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">for me i studied uh economics in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">undergrad years</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">and at that time i had written a paper</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">um i must have been about 18 or 19 at</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">the time on</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">uh the chinese party states</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">constitutional model</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">and i remember at the time one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">things that fascinated me about this was</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">i was shocked at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">thinking that the chinese state was</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">in terms of building a model of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">governance that was sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">to and in competition with the american</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">now this was obviously couched in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:13.360" style="s2">certain ways they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">win-win cooperation or in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.360" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">you know peaceful development but there</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">was an immense amount of thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">put into the idea that what china was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">building was a uniquely chinese path of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">um since then i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">understanding has crept out into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">discourse in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">bigger way but quite late in a way right</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re at a point now where</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">the relationship between china and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">us is something like a second cold war</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">or at the very least a contest for</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">over the global economy over</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">why is this the case i would posit that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">since the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">ended there was an assumption that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">participate in economic prosperity and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">stability</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">there was one way to do it uh you buy</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">into the american alliance and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">american model of governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">more or less if you do this you will</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">have those things</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">there are some exceptions to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">obviously saudi arabia has never</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">implemented american social values</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">uh singapore has economic prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">and english linguistic familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">but it has always framed itself as</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">having asian values</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">um you know in practice this means maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">a more authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">form of government although one that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">still somewhat democratic</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">uh and harsher enforcement of social</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">norms</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">but generally speaking it was understood</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">that these were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">you know iterations or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">unprincipled exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">of the american model</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">this is no longer the case and i would</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">basically say here that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">the fatal mistake that was made was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">thinking that we did not have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">to what elites in rising states and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">powers were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">had we looked at what the chinese elite</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">was saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">to itself and taken it seriously we</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">would have predicted their development</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">ex you know with extreme accuracy what</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">we&#39;re doing at palladium</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">is taking them seriously better late</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">than never right</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">uh and i think that what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">that there are things that we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">from this model in terms of challenging</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">our assumptions of what is necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">stability and for prosperity and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">on uh american america obviously is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">very different country</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">we have different expectations and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">social morays</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">but i think that four american elites</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">american governors to have more humility</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">about their expectations and assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">will be a good thing we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">translation work</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve done deeper dives or you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:01.919" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">writers verbally moved on deeper dives</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.919" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">as to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">discourse is like among chinese</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">political elites</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve brought that as well uh i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">mentioned already we&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">kazakhstan</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve looked at eastern europe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">soon going to be having a piece on</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">russia</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">and its project of using history to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">solidify</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">its national identity uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">basically in a world that&#39;s gonna become</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">more multi-polar</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to become conversant</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">not just with the ways that our elites</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">but with the ways that elites in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">number of other powers think</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of our central goals in</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">terms of global coverage</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of other stuff i could</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">discuss here peter but i think i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">maybe leave it to you and we could pivot</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">to q a here</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s some good stuff um so if you</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">one of our first salons here was with uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">robert zubrin</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">who is a big advocate of a direct mars</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">mission and you know a central focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">he has is why has the uh space program</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">that america built</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">failed um when america was</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">building you know set itself to school</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.559" style="s2">in the early 60s they&#39;re gonna put a man</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">this was not feasible this was not</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">politically feasible it had no popular</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">support it was not technologically</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.919" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">and by the end of the decade they did it</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">process of institution building you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">it included people like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">uh von braun you know a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">who built</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">um engineering institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">scientific institutions but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">political institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">um you know something that i i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">earlier but we&#39;ll bring it again</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">there&#39;s this assumption today that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">is science and technology on the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">hand and politics on the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">uh in the post-war period when we look</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">at the institutions that were built this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">also applies to things like darpa</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:38.400" style="s2">um this applies to the research done in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">u.s military that resulted in things</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">like our gps systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">uh or on technologies like cpus that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">appear on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">you know in a lot of our electronic</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">devices those institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">were built politically by people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">understood political landscape</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">and had goals that required scientific</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">and technological</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">means to be realized i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">political impetus is often the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">thing to occur in these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">and then a lot of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">assume are just this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">tide of uh technological progress are</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">often downstream</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">and obviously they can develop in ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">that their founders didn&#39;t foresee</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">but they are the result of you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">they&#39;re not just the result of some</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">inevitability of history</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">so i&#39;ll uh it&#39;ll be my answer for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">wolf did you want to jump in here as</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">well or shall we i mean maybe i&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">more specific about like particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">projects that i find interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">i mean so obvious ones the big the big</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">institution founders that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">aware of who are actually building</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">um you know the big silicon valley</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">in particular um</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if these really count but</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">amazon and spacex</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">uh not not actually based in the bay</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">area but uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">i think those ones are good examples of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">of kind of like people who are actively</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">founding institutions</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">and and building these</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">new pieces of machinery i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">there&#39;s that much</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">else going on it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">you know overseas there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">you look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">what g is doing with the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">communist party</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">um uh one of our sort of like big</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">surprise stories was</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on in kazakhstan where</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">nurse ultan has actually just been</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">totally rebuilding that country um</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">in a quite optimistic way and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">and then we you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">starting to look</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">briefly at the the situation in russia</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">like uh putin is obviously one of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">people who&#39;s been actually building</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">in america i think we&#39;ve had kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">long period</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">of no one having the power</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">or vision to build that much so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">hard to really name</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">i i&#39;m sure there&#39;s many good examples</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just off the top of my head it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">hard to name</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">a lot of exciting stuff other than uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">some of these companies that have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">founded in the last 20 years yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">and but i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">is um a part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">because the system of public</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">institutions right formal government</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">have decayed in a big way the instant</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">the public institutional golden age</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">in america i think was the post-war era</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">up until essentially the 60s you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">the space program that i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the first great institution that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">was built this kind of public</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">institution it was one of the last</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">from the 70s onward we see decay but we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">see also</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">spillover effects from those</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">in terms of public education in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">that now allow a bunch of private</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">institutions that are highly competent</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">to be built</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">the key point i&#39;m trying to make here is</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">that when we talk about institutions</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">this can apply to companies it can apply</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">states maybe it can apply to religious</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">cults</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">uh we&#39;re using this term in a broad way</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">the claim we&#39;re making here is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">there are equivalencies</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">between good well-run states and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">well-run companies and well-run cults</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">and their failure modes are often</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">similar too</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">when as in america&#39;s case may be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">system of institutions becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">spread thin that uh it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">impossible to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">so that the institution as a whole can</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">function right</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">what what american decision maker has</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">the power to really say</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">we need a systemic change right uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">there is really no one in control of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">so likewise when</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen this in a number of private</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">companies maybe apple is on this path</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">when the people who know how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">institution is meant to run</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">are no longer in the picture and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">succession is not achieved</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">then those institutions will decline and</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">how they decline will be the same across</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">states companies and so on</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">working on in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">understanding how the elite think what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">you know what what is that information</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">going to do for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">as far as you know leading to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">redesigning a new system</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">so um yeah good question</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">i&#39;m i wouldn&#39;t characterize it quite as</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">narrowly as like characterizing how the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">elite thinks i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">um that&#39;s kind of one of the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">aspects it&#39;s it&#39;s more like um</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">the larger trajectory of how they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">thought in the past versus thinking now</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">and how and like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">what things could look like differently</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">and and really focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">institutional part</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">uh as for like how they think now i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">i think dan feldman in the chat actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">caricatures it pretty well which is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">they the the driving ethos in america</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">right now especially among the elite is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">let&#39;s just make sure that we can get our</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">own kids into the right schools</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">and you know make sure do whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">to the country or whatever to like make</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">sure that you know i&#39;m getting my comfy</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">retirement</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">this is you know obviously a caricature</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">but also it&#39;s it&#39;s an ethos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">quite widespread among the elite in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">sense that like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not an ethos of i&#39;m in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">this situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m responsible for the situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:43.039" style="s2">but rather just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m just some upper middle class</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.039" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">i just want to get my kids into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">right school right and i oh i happen to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">have a lot of power so i&#39;m going to like</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">use that power</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">to keep stability keep the system</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">running</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">and make sure that i&#39;m getting mine</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">and that that is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">uh the current situation or like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">trouble with the current situation i</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">would diagnose that as</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">in a way a lack</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">either a lack of ambition or lack of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">coordination if if</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">you had the well there&#39;s many different</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">of of sort of describing what exactly is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">wrong with that i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">one of the mistakes that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.519" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">make though is they think oh the elite</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">less selfish they should be like</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">you know more altruistic care about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">everyone else uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">they should not just be</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">they should give away their power or</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">something like this and i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t actually solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">or and is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">some combination of that and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">completely unrealistic i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">the way that i see this getting solved</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">is again you need someone in charge who</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">has the power</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">who understands that they have the power</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">and has big enough goals of what to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">with that power</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">um you know obviously you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">benevolent goals and so on but at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">big enough goals that they see</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">their imperative as being something more</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">than just maintaining their own personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">fiefdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">um and i think we see this in the past</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">where you had times</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">uh you know obviously in a war situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">they&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have a very large goal</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">which is which is survival and conquest</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">um in the post-war scenario you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">had big goals like let&#39;s go to the moon</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">or let&#39;s prove that we&#39;re better than</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">the soviets</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">and i think i think it&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">have like those big driving goals</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">that for which you can&#39;t just suppress</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">the rest of society you have to mobilize</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">the rest of society</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">around some grander conception of why we</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">even have a society like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s perhaps one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">important questions what is society for</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s something that someone built</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s built for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">to maintain it is an ongoing process of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">why are we doing it right is it pure</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">altruism no one does</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">like very few people do that much for</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">pure altruism they have some motive what</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">are they trying to do with it um</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">and what&#39;s exciting about about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">that we have a society as opposed to not</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">having a society</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">why should i maintain it why should i</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">add to it why should i grow it</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">um and and i think that has to come</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">along with society-sized goals you need</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">to have some conception of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">where are we going as a society what</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">kind of society we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t just some nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">story that we tell people but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">something we actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s so i think that&#39;s like one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">the critical aspects</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure if this is really</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:43.760" style="s2">answering your question but</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s sort of one of the critical</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.760" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">aspects in how i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">the the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">elite motivation i guess and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">the there&#39;s the whole other side which</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">do they have do the elites have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">institutional coherence</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">and the knowledge to actually coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">around such a goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">and achieve it and actually go and build</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">the structures of society</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">that um that would allow them to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">so yeah i&#39;d like to jump in here quickly</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">before i think there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">uh illustration that we can make here</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">so this will be kind of a sneak peek for</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">the stoa uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">but someone in the palladium community</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">is writing a piece on her experience at</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">harvard</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">uh and one of the most fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">discussion topics is the way that career</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">fairs work</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s a very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">that happens because the harvard</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">community right we</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">you know there&#39;s children of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">billionaires there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">people from you know from wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">families in other countries</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">one would expect right any one of us who</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">hasn&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">oh if only i&#39;d been born with a billion</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">dollars or</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">10 million dollars to my name what would</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">i do with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">so you would expect it at a place where</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">a lot of people come</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">from you know families of means that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">there would be a big focus on okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">you have access to these kinds of forms</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">of dynastic wealth</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">how do you use them well how do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">achieve great things with them how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">you take</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">maybe a minor elite dynasty and make it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">into a great one</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t happen at all what happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">instead is that these kids are</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">shuttled off to career fairs where</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">mckinsey</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">and a few banks and maybe 10 or 20 other</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">are at every single affair for every</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">single faculty via the sciences or arts</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">or business</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:36.079" style="s2">or whatever um the result is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">there is immense pressure and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.079" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">competition there is a sort of striver</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:41.040" style="s2">mentality created</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">the impression is that there are very</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.040" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">few jobs that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">allow their applicants to both earn a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">good living</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">and keep their status you know the sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">of job that a harvard graduate should</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">i think that this is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">terrible situation to be in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">because if we live in a society where a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">lot of our institutions were</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">founded by very publicly oriented uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">decision makers whose and those</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">institutions depend on</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">that you know the people running them</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">think in long-term ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">and think in ways that how do you invest</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">in an institution or how do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">make the sacrifices necessary to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">running</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">uh that could be an education system it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">could be scientific research it could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">international alliances and personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">diplomatic relationships</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">you know there are a lot of these kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">of miniature empires that exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">when most of the elite class inculcates</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">itself into the mindset that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">that i should be striving for is a job</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">at mckinsey</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that those institutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">will end up lasting and we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">the short-termism</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">across both the private and the public</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">sector yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a good illustration there</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">i i have something to add to this so i</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an underlying assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">we&#39;re making here which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">uh a substantial social constructivism</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">of goals um that that basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:07.920" style="s2">even the elite is very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">influenced by what the narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">about what their role in society is and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">what they&#39;re supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">and right now the narrative is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">upper middle class that all elites are</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.839" style="s2">bad you&#39;re not supposed to be an elite</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to get rid of your power</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">except</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">only publicly really uh and and just be</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">upper middle class</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">and and go and get your like slick</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">consulting job at mckinsey fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">you know make your 200 000 a year maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">your 600 000</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.240" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">a year and you know just make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">no one</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">no one rocks your boat too much and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">like that&#39;s how things are narrativized</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">right now of like what you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">and if that is the narrative that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">floating around that&#39;s available that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">what people are going to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">um so one of the things that i want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">do with this project and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">you know i hope other people contribute</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">to this is i think we need to build up</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">a narrative of what is a positive role</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">for an elite in society that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">just something lame like that but is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">saying no you have power</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to build that power</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to build a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">uh a powerful system of governance and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">then go</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">and do these these you know ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">things uh in society with it like</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">let&#39;s actually solve our social problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">like we&#39;re supposed to actually build</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">institutions and solve our social</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">and yes that involves large amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">personal power large amounts of power</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">concentration at the top</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">and and a particular ethos a particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">way of being</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">someone mentioned no bless oblige in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">trap very much that kind of thing but we</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">also have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">i think recognize</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">where that comes from what it goes along</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">with i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">people are often trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">these narratives where</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">being in a being an elite is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">purely a position of liability you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">supposed to just help everyone else for</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">for no particular reason to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to be altruistic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">supposed to be a public servant</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">i think these narratives actually are</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">not inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">they fail to capture the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">and so they end up falling out of favor</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">i think we need narratives that are more</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">like why do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">help everyone else in society because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">makes us more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">right um we help other people because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">makes us</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">strong i mean it builds a stronger</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">society that can do more and do more</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">things and is more to the glory of its</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">rulers um</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">and and so you i think building</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">alternate narratives from the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">like upper middle class</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">strive within existing institutional</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">structure to kind of like maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">privilege</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">narrative is is necessary we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s much bolder than that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">and i think ironically like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">sees the problems with the current like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">maintain your privilege model of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">eliteness and they move in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">wrong direction from that or for for</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">good reason it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">why are we supporting an elite that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">um oriented towards perpetuating their</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">own privilege</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">for no particular reason uh and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">move like oh well let&#39;s just get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s share it let&#39;s spread it</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">around whereas i think what has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">is more like let&#39;s give that thing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">positive uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">utilization and come up with a positive</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">narrative of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">of the existence of an elite anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">one of my uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">larger kind of goals with with i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">all need to be working on cool let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">move to more questions though</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">so jeremy you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">yes thanks um yeah i just wondered about</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">the role of strategic competition with</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">rival powers and um</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">in creating competent institutions</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">do you think that that&#39;s a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">precondition</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">and um yeah i just kind of wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">hear your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">yeah i can jump onto this one go for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">i think that strategic competition</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">usually does end up</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">forcing these kinds of institutions to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">improve yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">so um i&#39;ll continue using the space race</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">example just because i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">and familiar one but the the space race</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">you know i think today we have this</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">the apollo program and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">occurred because</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">uh we understood that going to space was</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">the next chapter of the human story</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">uh and this kind of thing this is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">the case the soviet union</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">achieved most of the first milestones in</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">the space race</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.520" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">america and not all of america but</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">certain uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">people within its institutions realized</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">you know allowing the soviet union to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">achieve dominance in space was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">terrible idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">when the apollo program was being set up</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">even the scientific community mostly</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">thought it was a waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">uh it did not have a lot of support</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">there are a lot of other projects going</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">on right</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">nuclear energy and nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">um you know biology lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">projects that could use public patronage</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">so why should this one get it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">uh what happened was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">the pressure placed on u.s elites</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">and then the skin in the game put in by</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">kennedy actually publicly saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">that they were going to achieve this uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">they now it would be more damaging for</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">them to lose face on the global stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">against the soviet union uh i think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">pressure definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:47.119" style="s2">um added to the investments</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">that they were willing to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.119" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">institutionally and to how long term</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">they were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">if you are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">you know the the survival and global</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">dominance of your country over the next</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">50 years over the next 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be thinking on a level</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">that you just won&#39;t be if</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">you know you the next election cycle or</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">the next business cycle</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">is uh the main you know kpi basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">that you achieve</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">that you measure success on so i i do</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">think that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">um competition does create better elites</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting question here</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">though as to you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">challenges in the world that are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">human opponents</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">um you know we can think of the climate</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">we can think of the current pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">uh it&#39;s interesting to me how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">the current pandemic moved from being</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">this biological threat</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">to a blame game of which powers</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">or which you know the failures of which</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">most contributed to the the shutdown and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">everything that is coming after</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">there seems to be this weird tick that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">a human opponent causes people</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">to act in a much more substantive way</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">than a a more abstract or maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">non-visible one does</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">i think this is generally not a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">situation to be in</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">because it sort of dooms us to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">uh zero-sum thinking when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">what the future of the whole world looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">the future of the species i would like</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">to figure out ways that maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">have that kind of competition you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">people who talk about um getting off</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">earth so</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">wolf you mentioned spacex earlier as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">institution that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">very interesting and obviously its</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">founder has this very deep commitment</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">the existential risk we face by only</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">living on one planet</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">is like such a terrible thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">have to figure out a way to get off this</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">rock</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">so there are people who can</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">be motivated in those ways i would like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">to know</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">did ash just uh is his wi-fi</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">yeah i think so i can get it from there</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">yeah sure i can pick it up from there</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to follow exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">thread i have another</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">related answer to this question which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">that i think there&#39;s two things that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">um to i don&#39;t know renew</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">the institutional structure or the elite</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">of a country there&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">is you need existential narratives uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s my generalization</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">of the idea of needing like an external</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">opponent or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">so an existential narrative is something</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">like you absolutely have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">uh or you feel that you absolutely have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">pursue this imperative um and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a narrative when everyone is kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">of synced up on it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">and when you have everyone synced up on</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">an existential narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">what you have is a situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">where things that serve the existential</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">narrative or</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">or respond to the existential narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">effectively are easily promoted and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">that are obviously against serving the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">existential narrative are</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">are easily removed um the politics</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">becomes a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">of of basically responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">existential narrative if everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">synced up on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">so i think times of war when some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">country is actually materially about to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">kill everybody or or wipe you out or you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">know completely knock you off your</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">those are very easy scenarios in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">to construct an existential narrative</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">um but i want to generalize it because</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">as ash was saying we don&#39;t want to just</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">get into this like zero sum oh yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">need to be fighting forever</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">kind of mood it&#39;s it&#39;s like the question</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">is the construction of an existential</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">obviously war is is a very uh common</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">existential narrative but there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">other ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">you mentioned global warming etc you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">mentioned space travel</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">um you know we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">you could imagine sinking humanity up on</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">some kind of spiritual existential</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">narrative or something about</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">you know people that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve our</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">society has tried</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">over the last let&#39;s say 70 years to sync</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">people up on kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">alleviation of poverty on the question</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">of like basic human dignity and so on</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">have tried to make these things sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">like the central narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">that are motivating people um and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">create an existential narrative</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">in the absence of some</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">external factor that creates it for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">like war you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">pretty good narrative shaping</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">um that are able to kind of convince</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">that x is the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">um that&#39;s i think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">has been breaking down as we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">you know the proliferation of many</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">voices all kind of fighting with each</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">um with with just the general evolution</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">of our political situation especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">with the internet</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">coordinate everyone around</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">around any particular large existential</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">and also i think there&#39;s been kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">lack of creativity and a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">um vision in in coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">with narratives that could actually sync</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">everyone up um so that&#39;s the first part</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">the second part is obviously you need</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">some baseline level of of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">quality and elite quality that&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">take kind of uh take that narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">and do something useful with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s not always the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">that every country faced with an actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">existential situation</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">responds to it appropriately um even if</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">they&#39;re aware of it you know people do</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">lose wars</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">uh often due to incompetence and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">you know i think i think america was</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">faced with a pretty clear existential</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">narrative with with</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">uh the whole coronavirus situation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">we failed that one</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">um because of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">our internal incoherence so those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">the two things that i would say go into</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s like my generalization of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">external competition creates competence</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2">uh observation yeah i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">clarify the point you&#39;re making at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">end there right</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">uh in a lot of the best analysis that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">including stuff we&#39;ve published at</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">palladium on where the failure was</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">it was not in preparedness materially</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">and even institutionally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">america was fully prepared for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">pandemic what occurred was a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">where decisions were outsourced to other</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">or they were not made or there was no</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">coordination</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">between the people with the authority to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">make them that was the failure</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">yeah and or just like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">when something comes down the pipe like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">kovid there are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">actively and and vigorously trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">respond to that and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">not and what needs to happen to to bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">in that renewal is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">put those take those actively vigorously</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">responding people</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">and and promote them right they need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">move up the chain they need to get into</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">getting control of more of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">institutional machinery and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">that was something that did not happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">most of the people who were actively</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">vigorously responding to the thing were</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">more or less locked out of existing</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">institutional</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">structure and no one was willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">promote them or or able to promote them</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">um and you saw a little bit of it within</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">existing institutions but</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">but there wasn&#39;t a lot of like large</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">changes in institutional position on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">basis of who was responding effectively</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">to the thing and that&#39;s uh part of why</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">we didn&#39;t respond to it very well but i</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">think we can move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">question we&#39;ve hit that one pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:39.839" style="s2">thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">cool cool and we&#39;re not asking all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.839" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">questions in order and we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">to get to everyone and i think we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">time just for one more uh we have about</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">10 more minutes here</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">um albert lee or albert kim you had a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">okay how you guys doing um i just</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">described to your podcast i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">check out your website i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">interested in your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s like i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">interested in what you&#39;re about about</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">you know like the future of governance</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">and all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">um but what i find really curious is</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">your emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">on the elites um because my question was</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">what in your analysis uh leads you to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">conclude that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">there should be a perpetuation of an</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">elite class rather than</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">a more focus on decentralized power</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">and yeah i know you specifically</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">mentioned oh the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">you know in san francisco you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to happen like</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">i was i was really curious why you uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">like why you two</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">went that way because i mean the way i</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">see it especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">the way things are going like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">to me almost like a near-term solution</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">with society becoming more complex and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">like we&#39;re involved you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like dancing landscape and like i</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">don&#39;t believe a small group a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">cadre of elites is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">going to be able to handle this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">and that if we keep abiding by that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">then where the society is going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">collapse we&#39;re going to have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">like an industrial age society or</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">whatnot or even worse</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">so i just wonder one of your analysis</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll let you to conclude that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">focus on elites which is important into</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">yes i i can answer that um so the axiom</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">that i always bring in here is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">power exists</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">if you always have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">influence other people and to influence</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">social defense</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">in society there&#39;s there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">this power there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">ability to gain leverage and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">to gain leverage</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">means that someone is going to have it</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">someone is going to use it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">and they&#39;re generally going to use it to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">gain more leverage</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">because political leverage social</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">leverage</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">allows them to um</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">you know influence events in the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">that they want them to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:52:59.920" style="s2">so power is useful right so people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">going to seek power</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.920" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">and the result of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be competition for</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:08.880" style="s2">power and there&#39;s going to be someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be people attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.880" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">concentrate power and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">power is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">once you have it concentrated you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">prevent other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">from getting it and that means that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">tend to get relatively stable</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">concentrations of power it&#39;s you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.839" style="s2">generally get a balance</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">um of powers except where the powers are</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.839" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">heterogeneous in type</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">in which case usually the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">gets worked out is some kind of alliance</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">cooperation deal between the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">heterogeneous powers</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">such that they become a unified power</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">and so this is the genesis of an elite</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">and a genesis of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">all kind of centralized power going back</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">to the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">of the cell right the individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">biological cell which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">a region of controlled resources</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:58.880" style="s2">surrounded by a wall um</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">there&#39;s this is like the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.880" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">fact of life is power</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">and with technological progress</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">over the last you know three billion</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">years but especially the last 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">we have increasing sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">of our means of power it&#39;s increasing</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">sophistication of ability</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">to coordinate more and more resources</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">and to apply</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">force further and further various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">of force not just physical</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">um and so i think the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">this analysis has sort of like nothing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">to do with what we want it has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">to do with</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">with even how humans are this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">relatively fundamental facts about</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">how influence over things happening in</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">the universe</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">works and uh the conclusion that i draw</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">from all of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">is that with increasing technological</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">sophistication you always get</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">on average in the long term more</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">concentration of power more</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">centralization of power</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">and larger empires so</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">i think that that is generally the story</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:06.400" style="s2">of history that&#39;s generally what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.400" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">and so then if we apply that to our</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">current situation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">okay increasing technological</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">sophistication we are likely to continue</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">having an elite</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">it is likely therefore to continue being</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">very important</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">what this elite wants to do what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">trying to do how they&#39;re doing it etc</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s this this huge important</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">problem of okay we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">power how shall we use it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">approach this question as well for maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">the different direction</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">um you know you&#39;re mentioning blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">probably in the last 20 years the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.599" style="s2">biggest thing we thought was going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">cause this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.599" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">radical decentralization was the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">internet um</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">digital technologies in particular what</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">do they do they operate in scale</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">they build networks they make those</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">networks legible to each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">but especially to the central</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">coordinating power</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">usually the company and uh increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">in the last 10 years they have gathered</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">they&#39;ve harvested we could say data from</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">um governments were being out-competed</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">in their ability to control those kinds</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s no longer the case um we saw with</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">covet that especially east asian states</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">had you know on on a very to a</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">but even in the u.s we had um a coveted</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">in the uk as well</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">in a digital way and so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">with technology</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.880" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">you know and who knows i mean maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">some technological advance at some point</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">that blocks this trend somehow</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:56.839" style="s2">um but historically what we have seen</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">is that almost every technological</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.839" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">advance uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:04.400" style="s2">has been a way ultimately for</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">governing institutions to have increased</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">legibility over</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">populations that they govern now you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">have very dystopian versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">right if you&#39;re if you&#39;re in xinjiang</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">you&#39;re getting like a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">you know hard-fisted and fairly ruthless</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">application of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">but you can also have more um</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">you know peaceable and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">pro-social version so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">in taiwan uh this is something i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">about for the magazine</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">taiwan had an a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">open and data-heavy approach you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:39.920" style="s2">using mechanisms we would not want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">use in the us</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">on a popular level like combining</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">insurance data</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">with travel data tracking people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:47.839" style="s2">movements and so on</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">but because taiwan has built</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">increase the ability for citizens in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.440" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">to inform the policies and decisions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">the central power</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">there&#39;s much more of a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.079" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">relationship between center and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">periphery</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">so i&#39;m not proposing that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">single model but</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:08.559" style="s2">across all these models the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">that matters is whether the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">institutionals are functional and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">responsive</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">and the thing i would basically say here</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">is that an institution</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">by its nature has a group of owners or</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">at least managers</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">that understand how it works and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">have privileged information</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">as to that institution and i i have not</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">seen any good argument that</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">a technological solution uh is going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">route around that fundamental fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">i i would uh want to add one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">in response to</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">dan feldman&#39;s question or comment that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">um you know technology accelerates the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:49.760" style="s2">constitution concentration of power</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">um does that concentration become so</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.760" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">that the larger system destabilizes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">how will nature resolve</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">accelerating technology uh further</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:59.680" style="s2">coalescing power i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">really important and deep question</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.680" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">um the answer is that yes concentrations</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">and centralizations of power are fragile</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">they they grow they take over the space</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.760" style="s2">but then because they are optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">dominance and not</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.760" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">for sustainability they inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">are mortal and start to decay</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">and they they don&#39;t contain within them</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">the systems of their own</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">uh renewal of neces of governing the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">governing the sort of sort of whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">cybernetic stack uh towards like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">elimination of cancers and parasites</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:43.359" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">you end up with with death basically you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.359" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">end up with mortality</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:48.559" style="s2">of these large complex systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.559" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">key the key thing there</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">is that as we build these large complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">systems of</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">our society um we want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">pay a lot more attention to that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">sustainability question</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">as we you know we build a new order um</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">or or if we&#39;re ever in the position of</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">building a new order you want to pay a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">lot of attention to that sustainability</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">question which is the long-term uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:18.400" style="s2">governance of the internal order making</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.400" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">immediately collapsing and then through</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.559" style="s2">these collapses or when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">anticipating a collapse</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">we want to pay a lot of attention to um</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:31.119" style="s2">the survivability of that collapse and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">making sure again</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.119" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">that we are sowing those seeds of new</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">growth in at that</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">that sort of height of of power so</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">again this is how animals and plants</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">solve this problem animals and plants</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">have the problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">that a concentration of order is</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:48.319" style="s2">inherently fragile and mortal</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">they always die which means they need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">pay some attention to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:54.720" style="s2">okay well how do i then redirect some</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">fraction of my resources to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.720" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">perpetuation of of uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">the form through reproduction and i</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">think we have to think that way about</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.200" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">society as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">uh and this is partially the frame that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">palladium comes in with is if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">facing the death of a number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">our institutions that have been going</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">for a while they had an established</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">but they&#39;ve been building up too much</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">entropy um</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">we&#39;re going to face the death of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">things we need to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">seeds of new growth</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">we need to be founding the new</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">institutions the new ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">the new networks that are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:29.359" style="s2">the next phase of order and i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">these are really</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.359" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">fundamental issues in in how order and</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">power works</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">in in the universe and so i think we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">have to keep those in mind when thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:40.559" style="s2">where we are in that sort of cycle of</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">mortality</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">uh and and what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">response to that and so i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">uh what we need to be thinking now is</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">how do we sow the the seeds of new</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">uh what exactly do we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">building in terms of institutions and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">and then as we plan for uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">a subsequent order to be uh to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">rebuilt</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">um let&#39;s think about that sustainability</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">question as well</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">making sure that we have all the like</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">cybernetic um</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">regulatory mechanisms that keep it from</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">immediately collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">let me just make a final point here as</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">well uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think what either of us are</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">claiming is that elites kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">never have over and that there is kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">of one permanent elite that has ruled</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">all through history or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:28.559" style="s2">this this is not the case uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">elites do in a lot of cases have more</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.559" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">staying power than we realize</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">so one of my favorite examples here is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">florence where</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">uh if you look at the most prominent</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">family of thorns today</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">a number of them were also among the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">prominent families of the 1400s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">that is an incredible endurance</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">you know think about all the stages of</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">history from</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">you know 30 years war to the industrial</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">revolution to multiple world wars that</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">you had to survive</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">while maintaining your position however</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">you obviously also have turnover</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:05.119" style="s2">but that turnover often occurs by</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">kind of maybe a lower rank of an elite</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.119" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">overthrowing an upper rank</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">even in china today after the communist</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">and cultural revolutions</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">a lot of the red princelings as they</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">call them have</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">roots in the landowner class of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">country during the end of the imperial</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">era</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">i&#39;d also i know elite overproduction has</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.520" end="01:03:25.599" style="s2">been mentioned a few times in the chat</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">um i think that what elite</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.599" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">overproduction often</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">is is a dead institution that has</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">maintained itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:35.839" style="s2">as a status granting mechanism so what i</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">mean by that is you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.839" end="01:03:41.200" style="s2">if if oxford tomorrow morning stop doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">any useful research or harvard tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.200" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">stop doing any useful research how long</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:47.280" style="s2">would it take</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.280" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">for people to stop going well i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.280" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">going to say it but how long would it</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">take for people to stop going to harvard</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t happen tomorrow morning</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">so you know law schools or non-profits</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">and this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">or the u.n maybe you know these</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">things can retain status long after they</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:09.839" style="s2">the ability to generate value</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">and notice that even when those things</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.839" end="01:04:16.960" style="s2">die an elite that jettisons 70 or 80</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">of its members but 20 keep their place</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.960" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">is it&#39;s still you know a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">same people and i think in reality what</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">usually happens in turnover is</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:26.880" style="s2">some portion of the governing class</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">maintains its position</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.880" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">some new proportion of institution</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:32.799" style="s2">builders or</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">you know new men as they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.799" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">sometimes in the classical histories</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">come in and some proportion is medicined</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">but there is a continuity in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">i think there is often more turnover</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:48.720" style="s2">even in these radical</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:50.160" style="s2">uh disruptions than we usually think is</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.720" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.160" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">um yeah with with that i&#39;m seeing a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.920" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">of</p>
