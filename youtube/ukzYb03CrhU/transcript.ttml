<p begin="00:00:07.230" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">as a very big problem or a significant</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.799" end="00:00:14.699" style="s2">challenge that we have to address and</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">that challenge is how do we know who to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.699" end="00:00:19.589" style="s2">trust and how can we be sure that export</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:22.710" style="s2">information is actually reliable in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.589" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">today&#39;s world where we have a number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">people that for ideological reasons are</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">actively fighting against scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:34.219" style="s2">expertise we have a world where some</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.510" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">and of course we have this public</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">huge huge challenge for us because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:54.649" style="s2">big complex problems in the world can</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">only be solved if we have reliable</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">I want to review that explores this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:05.130" style="s2">topic in a very unique way is this one</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">are we all scientific experts now by</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.130" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">Kerry Collins well first of all Harry</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">Collins he is a social theorist so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">one of the founders of the field of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">sociology of science so a few decades</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:21.480" style="s2">ago earlier in his career he spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:23.910" style="s2">of time criticizing science taking it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.480" end="00:01:25.620" style="s2">down from its pedestal of being special</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.910" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">in the world of knowledge and showing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.620" end="00:01:29.730" style="s2">human or that science is a human</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:33.300" style="s2">endeavor filled with all of the folly</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.730" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">and FAL a valley ability the frailty of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.300" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">the human condition and then what</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:40.050" style="s2">happened was based on his work and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:42.900" style="s2">work of other sociologists studying the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.050" end="00:01:44.940" style="s2">scientific method we came to a place</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.900" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">where people in the humanities were</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.940" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">criticizing science so much that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">had all but destroyed any of its</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:52.410" style="s2">uniqueness and so people were just say</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">well if you have an opinion about</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.410" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">science doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">in a field of research for 20 years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">merely you an opinion and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:04.410" style="s2">different from my opinion based on</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">reading a 200-word paragraph on a blog</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.410" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">post that made me upset so now your</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:10.829" style="s2">expertise is totally illegitimate and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">don&#39;t really care about it one a place</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.829" end="00:02:15.799" style="s2">where that level of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:17.510" style="s2">vism his way to a common place so what</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.799" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">Hilary Collins did coming back after all</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.510" end="00:02:22.459" style="s2">of those decades of work and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:24.049" style="s2">the practices of science and the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.459" end="00:02:26.120" style="s2">of knowledge that people develop in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.049" end="00:02:28.819" style="s2">science came back and wrote this short</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.120" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">see it&#39;s very small it&#39;s a short easy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.819" end="00:02:33.709" style="s2">read book it&#39;s actually very accessible</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.349" style="s2">to the layperson and what he does is he</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.709" end="00:02:38.540" style="s2">tries to make the case that maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.349" end="00:02:40.909" style="s2">went too far and that the other social</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:43.909" style="s2">theorists criticizing science have also</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.909" end="00:02:46.430" style="s2">gone way too far and that science is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.909" end="00:02:48.950" style="s2">actually special and important in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.430" end="00:02:50.750" style="s2">couple of very specific ways that only</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.950" end="00:02:53.420" style="s2">people studying the sociology of science</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:56.660" style="s2">understand so he answers his own</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.420" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">question no we are decidedly not all</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.660" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">scientific experts now but the only way</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:03.260" style="s2">for us to know who the experts are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:06.470" style="s2">what the important kinds of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.260" end="00:03:08.269" style="s2">maybe is to systematically go through</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.470" end="00:03:10.760" style="s2">and answer the question what are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.269" end="00:03:13.190" style="s2">different kinds of expertise and so sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.760" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">there are types of knowledge or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.190" end="00:03:18.620" style="s2">technical expertise if I get a PhD in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">high-energy particle physics I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.620" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">to understand quantum mechanics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.109" style="s2">going to understand things about</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:26.090" style="s2">chemistry about certain instrumentation</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.109" end="00:03:28.459" style="s2">that I use but there&#39;s another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.090" end="00:03:29.900" style="s2">expertise in addition to this that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.459" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">makes the case for being extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.900" end="00:03:36.139" style="s2">important and that is the expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:39.410" style="s2">social knowledge of the people involved</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.139" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2">and the people the reputations of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.410" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">people so I am a climate scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:46.819" style="s2">I&#39;m engaged in research with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">other climate scientists I know which</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.819" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">one of those which of those scientists</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">are good-hearted well-meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:56.090" style="s2">hard-working honest people I know which</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:03:57.980" style="s2">ones are kind of the crackpots that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">don&#39;t really trust that no one really</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.980" end="00:04:01.669" style="s2">pays attention to because all of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:03.709" style="s2">climate scientists know that their work</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.669" end="00:04:06.199" style="s2">is on the margins so there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.709" end="00:04:07.959" style="s2">social knowledge in context for people</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.199" end="00:04:10.099" style="s2">who are actively involved in a community</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.959" end="00:04:11.629" style="s2">turns out that that kind of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.099" end="00:04:13.099" style="s2">one of the most important kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.629" end="00:04:15.949" style="s2">knowledge for determining whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.099" end="00:04:17.720" style="s2">scientific expertise is valid or not so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.949" end="00:04:19.659" style="s2">if you&#39;re questioning the health</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.720" end="00:04:21.769" style="s2">outcomes of a particular study as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.659" end="00:04:23.570" style="s2">layperson you don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.769" end="00:04:25.160" style="s2">researchers involved are credible or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.570" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">because you&#39;re not part of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.810" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">field of science but the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.060" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">in that field of science have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:35.660" style="s2">social expertise and so they can discern</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:37.400" style="s2">who&#39;s trustworthy and who is it turns</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.660" end="00:04:39.650" style="s2">out this is true for all of us in every</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.400" end="00:04:41.270" style="s2">domain of practice but it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.650" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">that we really need to appreciate in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">world of technical knowledge because</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:47.090" style="s2">that is where the social layer of</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.090" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">important so if you want to better</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.950" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">understand how to see the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:56.540" style="s2">kinds of expertise make sense of which</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">scientists are valid and whether what</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:02.390" style="s2">up a copy of this book and then explore</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.830" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">how it applies to all forms of</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">be better armed to go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">and discern who you can trust what</p>
