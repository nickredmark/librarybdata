<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">background and how did you meet John</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.620" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">well I think that was funny when I the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">actual biography is probably pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">scant on the detail and I&#39;m novelty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">pretty straightforward really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">I was students um oh god what is it now</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">some 10 years ago when I was an</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">undergraduate at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">Toronto I encountered John at the time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:17.270" style="s2">was sort of flitting from one discipline</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">to the next in search of a location</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.270" end="00:01:24.689" style="s2">academically and and I was doing a major</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">in philosophy which I then I then ended</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.689" end="00:01:27.689" style="s2">up downgrading at the time but I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:29.159" style="s2">doing a major in philosophy and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.689" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">trying to find I would she trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.159" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">find an academic home trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">understand where to pitch my tent and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:36.439" style="s2">that was not a straightforward task for</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.439" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">before during or since finding John was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">a seminal event for me because it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">the beginning of finding it was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">beginning of finding a center around</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">which all of the other interests</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">I had could then be gathered and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">arranged and organized and I think he</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">was that too a lot of people long before</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">I ever met and certainly as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">was neither the first nor have I been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">the last person to be to fall under his</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:12.600" style="s2">particular pedagogical spell it happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.600" end="00:02:19.080" style="s2">and thereafter it became it became a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">kind of it was perhaps telling that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.080" end="00:02:23.460" style="s2">fell right at the median of my studies</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.910" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">because I can pretty neatly divided my</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.460" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">time as a student into a before John</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">with a key and an advertiser and I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">a feeling that a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">listening to this will intuitively know</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">what I mean by that because I think a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">lot of people have since had the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">experience virtually that I did as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">student so there isn&#39;t really any now in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">so far as the work with John is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">concerned I&#39;ve been doing it virtually</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">ever since then I think I met him as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">student in 2010 which is 10 years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">could and and very soon after that so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">mean so impress was I by this course not</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">only the content of the course but of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">this particular pedagogical style that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:14.460" style="s2">was I was I was possessed to the idea to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">pursue him and to try and insinuate</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.460" end="00:03:17.880" style="s2">myself into his work whatever way I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:20.250" style="s2">possibly could and that started</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.880" end="00:03:22.890" style="s2">gradually started very slow and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.250" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">incrementally but over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.890" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">time we became we became for a while it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">remained the students and teachers</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">dynamic I would say for a year or two</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">after that at the time he was working on</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">a phrase see to a book that would later</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">take many different forms and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">parts of it then were distilled and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">became zombies in Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">eventually but at the time it was much</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">more inclusive I would say everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen not everything because</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">a lot of those arguments have developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">since then but I would say the structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:04:00.240" style="s2">of awakening from the meaning crisis was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:03.000" style="s2">originally going to be one massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.240" end="00:04:05.460" style="s2">volume and so when I started to work</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.000" end="00:04:07.830" style="s2">with John we really it was attending to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.460" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">that project and that project soon</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.830" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">became so unwieldy that it became clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:14.070" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t something we were going</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">to be able to to eat in one bite and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.070" end="00:04:18.109" style="s2">would have to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">dispersed among a series of projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.109" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">over the course of time and of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:24.590" style="s2">those series of projects in and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">themselves start to elaborate and start</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.590" end="00:04:32.290" style="s2">to unspool and so you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:35.450" style="s2">imagine how they adopt that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.290" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">the the whole way the whole way of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.450" end="00:04:39.050" style="s2">project as you walk down is begins to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">get farther and farther away as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.050" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">looked at it that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:47.270" style="s2">experience of working mothers</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:50.570" style="s2">but anyway so virtually since then and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.270" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">certainly long since long since leaving</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.570" end="00:04:55.389" style="s2">school I&#39;ve been working on and working</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:05:00.470" style="s2">on working with virtually all the while</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.389" end="00:05:01.729" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of my my occupationally</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.470" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">and my attentions are a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.729" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">divided I work and I work in public</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.460" end="00:05:10.490" style="s2">policy as as a day job but but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:12.139" style="s2">moonlight as a something of an amateur</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.490" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">philosopher I suppose they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.139" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">think to call myself that but I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.150" end="00:05:19.490" style="s2">this something like that yeah and your</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:21.950" style="s2">degree is in semiotic srate the with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.490" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">study of symbols play mainly in some way</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.950" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">yeah now semiotic you know I say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.550" end="00:05:35.710" style="s2">semiotics semiotics at least as as it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.330" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">was taught at the U of T was I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:41.200" style="s2">more than a concentrated discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:45.320" style="s2">study unto itself it was a convenient</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.200" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">receptacle in which to group a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.320" end="00:05:50.330" style="s2">other attendant interests and discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.370" style="s2">so you know a lot of my work with John</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.330" end="00:05:54.139" style="s2">for instance you know when it was still</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.370" end="00:05:56.750" style="s2">when it still fell into the category of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.139" end="00:05:58.580" style="s2">course work or class work a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.750" end="00:06:00.130" style="s2">I was able to get under the semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.580" end="00:06:02.930" style="s2">spanner</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.130" end="00:06:04.220" style="s2">because semiotic sisimiut exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.930" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">from that so I found a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.220" end="00:06:08.610" style="s2">identity crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:10.379" style="s2">and and so that makes it pretty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.610" end="00:06:13.770" style="s2">pretty multifocal on that make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.379" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">convenient that makes it a convenient</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.770" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">placeholder for a lot of other things it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:19.650" style="s2">becomes a way of Co hearing studies</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">rather than their studies at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.650" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what it did for me and then so so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:29.069" style="s2">you&#39;ve been working on with John on on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:30.719" style="s2">on on the meaning crisis and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.069" end="00:06:32.610" style="s2">particularly gets the the relation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.719" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">the symbol does homage to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.610" end="00:06:36.030" style="s2">crisis I want to get to the zombies but</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:42.629" style="s2">what is the meaning crisis mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.030" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">what is what is meaning mean to you well</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.270" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">for me the meaning crisis is about a</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.399" end="00:10:16.550" style="s2">secondary discussions that it has become</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.889" end="00:10:20.029" style="s2">clear to me that the way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.550" end="00:10:23.540" style="s2">find things meaningful is not the way in</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.029" end="00:10:25.610" style="s2">which we have always found that there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.540" end="00:10:27.559" style="s2">a texture phenomenologically this</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">somehow been slacking in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.559" end="00:10:31.180" style="s2">relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">and I think that has a lot to do with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.180" end="00:10:40.540" style="s2">lots of symbolic thinking and literalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:45.700" style="s2">as people like you and Paul Tillich have</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.540" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">has explained it so I think that for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.700" end="00:10:49.570" style="s2">my particular experience of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.570" end="00:10:56.620" style="s2">I think centers on the loss of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">thinking as a virtue by which to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.620" end="00:11:04.200" style="s2">and in the absence of that that life</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:09.130" style="s2">takes on a kind of aimless vacuous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.200" end="00:11:12.460" style="s2">slackened sense that somehow sensibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.130" end="00:11:17.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s no longer it no longer holds</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.460" end="00:11:19.810" style="s2">together totleigh and so that I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.410" end="00:11:22.990" style="s2">that somewhere to begin where do we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.810" end="00:11:25.510" style="s2">so what is it about symbols that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.990" end="00:11:29.050" style="s2">think gives it gives them this this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.510" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">ability to help us find that meaning to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.050" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">find fill that gap</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:45.460" style="s2">well symbols are sort of like I I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.550" end="00:11:48.120" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful I think it&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.460" end="00:11:51.400" style="s2">understand symbols as participial that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.120" end="00:11:54.970" style="s2">participial patterns we tend to think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.400" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">symbols as though we would as we would</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.970" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">shines as things that denote meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">refer and indicate other phenomena but a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">symbol is actually not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:10.390" style="s2">fundamentally and a lot of people a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:11.890" style="s2">of people have done a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.390" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">certainly standing on the shoulders of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.890" end="00:12:16.930" style="s2">eager observations when I say that over</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:19.180" style="s2">the course of time I have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.930" end="00:12:21.490" style="s2">observe and explain that properly that a</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.490" end="00:12:28.170" style="s2">change in the way that you participate</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.170" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">unconcealed series of patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:36.670" style="s2">intelligibility that when embodied seem</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.230" end="00:12:51.670" style="s2">and though the the aspect of that symbol</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.330" end="00:12:55.030" style="s2">might be as simple as an object for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.670" end="00:12:58.030" style="s2">person right in the case of Tillich has</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.030" end="00:13:00.370" style="s2">a famous example about the nation&#39;s flag</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.030" end="00:13:03.070" style="s2">right or John and I have used the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.370" end="00:13:04.990" style="s2">example of a wedding ring or certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.070" end="00:13:06.430" style="s2">there are any number of percentages that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.990" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">have taken the basic symbols of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:15.520" style="s2">important property of the symbol is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:18.970" style="s2">the literal denotation of that object or</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.050" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">meaning of the symbol is a gesture of</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.490" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">we are possessed of that there&#39;s a kind</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:45.340" style="s2">uses the example of the nation&#39;s flag</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.220" end="00:13:52.180" style="s2">appears on the slide I think those</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.510" end="00:13:54.310" style="s2">things are often confused when I say a</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.180" end="00:13:57.400" style="s2">nation&#39;s flag as a symbol for nationhood</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:13:59.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean image the icons of</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.740" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">play when it&#39;s suspended at the top of</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.330" end="00:14:20.230" style="s2">the motioning quality of a symbol is the</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.600" end="00:14:26.830" style="s2">seems to gesture away from itself we</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.870" end="00:15:02.670" style="s2">think of a symbol as implicating you in</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.959" end="00:15:33.300" style="s2">symbols that contra distinguishes them</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.750" end="00:15:36.209" style="s2">from signs that they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.300" end="00:15:39.630" style="s2">patterns to be embodied and not things</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.209" end="00:15:42.839" style="s2">to be referred so so that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.630" end="00:15:45.149" style="s2">of depth to to symbols and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.839" end="00:15:46.290" style="s2">what one thing we&#39;re about we&#39;re focused</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.149" end="00:15:48.660" style="s2">on here is the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:50.370" style="s2">religion and my instinct tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.660" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">that the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.370" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">needs symbols and maybe its own symbols</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:58.829" style="s2">but it raises the question can you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">deliberately create symbols or do they</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.829" end="00:16:06.570" style="s2">sort of a rise can you you know can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:09.810" style="s2">come up with a I guess a sign that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.570" end="00:16:12.360" style="s2">becomes that has the potential to become</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.810" end="00:16:13.589" style="s2">a symbol or is it just like can you sit</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.360" end="00:16:15.089" style="s2">down and say I&#39;m going to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.589" end="00:16:17.250" style="s2">symbol or is it something that has to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.089" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">come out of some sort of instinct some</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.250" end="00:16:23.130" style="s2">sort of insight and discovery process I</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.660" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">hope that makes sense think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.130" end="00:16:27.449" style="s2">question it doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">good question and it&#39;s a well I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.449" end="00:16:32.660" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the one of the axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:35.850" style="s2">formulations of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.660" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">definitionally that Tillich uses and um</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.850" end="00:16:41.670" style="s2">this is this is a definition that he and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">Union and Virgil it&#39;s precisely that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.670" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">cannot simply invent the symbol now</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:47.490" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:51.000" style="s2">interpretive latitude I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.490" end="00:16:54.930" style="s2">might take John and I are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.000" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">talk about the idea of reinvent EO as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.930" end="00:17:00.839" style="s2">concept that is neither that is neither</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">that neither arises wholly within nor</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.839" end="00:17:05.189" style="s2">wholly without that somehow somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.029" end="00:17:07.410" style="s2">between invention and discovery that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.189" end="00:17:07.610" style="s2">there is a poetic agency on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.410" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.610" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">vidual but also a kind of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:15.620" style="s2">request that it somehow emerges neither</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">from the world to the individual nor</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.620" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">from the individual to the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:21.950" style="s2">somewhere on a shared horizon where</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:23.510" style="s2">those two things meet so perhaps when</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.950" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the word invention</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.510" end="00:17:30.110" style="s2">if we were to qualify the definition and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:31.910" style="s2">qualify it deeply then perhaps we could</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.110" end="00:17:36.980" style="s2">find a way in which that might be true</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.910" end="00:17:39.530" style="s2">but I think no fundamentally it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.980" end="00:17:41.060" style="s2">one of the most significant properties</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.530" end="00:17:44.180" style="s2">of the symbol that it can&#39;t simply be</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.060" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">conjured by the will of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.180" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s something that emerges now how</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">and why and from what it emerges I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:54.560" style="s2">suppose is where we parcel this and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:57.680" style="s2">could get quite difficult and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.560" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">technical depending on whose line of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.680" end="00:18:01.510" style="s2">thinking that we want to follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">I think obviously for someone like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.510" end="00:18:07.630" style="s2">the symbols emerge as a way of mediating</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:10.010" style="s2">the conscious with me with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.630" end="00:18:12.560" style="s2">archetypal fundament of the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.010" end="00:18:15.530" style="s2">and that that&#39;s a way of integrating and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.560" end="00:18:20.210" style="s2">individuating the dimensions of the self</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.530" end="00:18:24.560" style="s2">in its polar state that the symbol is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.210" end="00:18:30.560" style="s2">is a power of mediation between what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.560" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">what is mysterious and and students to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.560" end="00:18:35.900" style="s2">do well outside the boundaries of zero</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">and then the shear in adjustability of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.900" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">that mystery that somehow the symbol is</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:47.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a spillway for the Oceanic of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">inexhaustible that allows it to possess</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.800" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">what is what remains within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:54.410" style="s2">boundaries of a frame it influence it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:56.510" style="s2">but not overwhelm it so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.410" end="00:19:00.830" style="s2">imagine the symbol as a kind of aperture</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.510" end="00:19:03.650" style="s2">that helps to organize our visioning of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.830" end="00:19:06.590" style="s2">the world and depending on how it</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.650" end="00:19:08.750" style="s2">organizes our visioning it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.590" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">ultimately determine what of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.750" end="00:19:15.110" style="s2">we see so that was a very long way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:16.370" style="s2">saying no yeah you can&#39;t just you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.110" end="00:19:20.210" style="s2">simply conjure them and so then</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.370" end="00:19:21.380" style="s2">obviously then the about servation that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.210" end="00:19:25.669" style="s2">I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:27.950" style="s2">the corollary to that is well if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.669" end="00:19:32.710" style="s2">can&#39;t simply invent a symbol and work</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.950" end="00:19:36.830" style="s2">where we&#39;re living at a time when our</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.710" end="00:19:39.259" style="s2">sacred symbols have been exhausted and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.830" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">largely turns into idols for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.259" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">people what then what kind of power of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:49.880" style="s2">intervention do we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:52.429" style="s2">recover the kind of meta meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.880" end="00:19:55.100" style="s2">that only symbols can provide and only</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.429" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">symbols can organize it is not an easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:19:59.269" style="s2">question I knew the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:04.940" style="s2">question there would be no need for all</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.269" end="00:20:07.279" style="s2">of this work so so just on a on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.940" end="00:20:08.809" style="s2">practical level is it something we sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.279" end="00:20:11.330" style="s2">of just have to just keep an eye out for</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.809" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">you know as we&#39;re going through you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.330" end="00:20:15.279" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to come up with certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:18.620" style="s2">certain rituals and ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.279" end="00:20:21.710" style="s2">are there things we can look for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.620" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">you know will symbols just become</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.710" end="00:20:30.710" style="s2">manifest and and we&#39;ll just will notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:31.460" style="s2">them and say yeah that&#39;s it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.710" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">good question</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.460" end="00:20:41.659" style="s2">I think I think that um I mean symbols</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:45.470" style="s2">like certainly the symbols that we know</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.659" end="00:20:48.259" style="s2">that have become epochal have not have</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.470" end="00:20:50.419" style="s2">not risen in a single instant you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.259" end="00:20:52.970" style="s2">they have done so imperceptibly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.419" end="00:20:54.980" style="s2">gradually and they&#39;re dawning has been a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.970" end="00:20:57.019" style="s2">gradual dawn it&#39;s sort of like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.980" end="00:20:58.879" style="s2">they&#39;re dawning has been of a high to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.019" end="00:21:01.279" style="s2">Gary in time whereby that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.879" end="00:21:03.169" style="s2">you&#39;re not aware that the symbol has</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.279" end="00:21:04.940" style="s2">done until you become aware that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.169" end="00:21:09.980" style="s2">thing in virtue of which you see and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.940" end="00:21:11.480" style="s2">know backs onto that symbol right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:12.889" style="s2">that and that I mean become because of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.480" end="00:21:15.230" style="s2">that all of the platonic and neo</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.549" end="00:21:26.600" style="s2">in and of itself cannot be seen saved</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.750" end="00:21:32.120" style="s2">with the prosthesis of certain practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.600" end="00:21:34.580" style="s2">that help to recollect and to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.120" end="00:21:37.220" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole idea of I think</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:39.070" style="s2">myself a little too steep in my own</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.160" end="00:32:42.980" style="s2">religious ancestry</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.070" end="00:32:45.410" style="s2">to be completely credulous that such a</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.410" end="00:32:52.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a project worth undertaking I do</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.570" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">and and no one is more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.130" end="00:33:00.590" style="s2">undertaking it than John and company but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:03.230" style="s2">precisely because the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.590" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">symbol as a coherent mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.230" end="00:33:13.730" style="s2">religion is spontaneous and emerges from</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.730" end="00:33:19.340" style="s2">has such a project has to be approached</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.920" end="00:33:21.500" style="s2">I think great with great care and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.340" end="00:33:23.030" style="s2">think that so yeah I guess that&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.500" end="00:33:26.390" style="s2">of saying I don&#39;t know it really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.030" end="00:33:29.420" style="s2">know but I but I live to it with great</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.390" end="00:33:31.550" style="s2">interest and and and faith base in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.420" end="00:33:33.140" style="s2">proper sense of the term because what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.550" end="00:33:37.250" style="s2">happening I mean the very thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.140" end="00:33:41.060" style="s2">motivating the impetus that is motivated</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.250" end="00:33:43.790" style="s2">with the same impetus that is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.060" end="00:33:46.460" style="s2">call attention to what has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.790" end="00:33:49.190" style="s2">happening beneath our awareness for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.460" end="00:33:52.760" style="s2">very very long time and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.190" end="00:33:58.060" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s already a fused with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.760" end="00:34:00.290" style="s2">lot of humility and a lot of caution so</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.060" end="00:34:04.340" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s how I feel about</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.290" end="00:34:07.280" style="s2">that fair enough and I think it&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.340" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">think millat of us here you see it as</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.280" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">the same way an experiment that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:17.060" style="s2">worth worth trying and devoting our time</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:21.650" style="s2">and attention to and and to see what see</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.060" end="00:34:23.510" style="s2">what we can do with it yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.650" end="00:34:26.090" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.510" end="00:34:31.600" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s a certain irony in</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.090" end="00:34:35.630" style="s2">the term and I know there is religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.600" end="00:34:40.490" style="s2">it&#39;s important I think for anyone for</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.630" end="00:34:45.460" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s participating directly or</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.490" end="00:34:48.200" style="s2">indirectly and experimentally for this</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.460" end="00:34:49.820" style="s2">it&#39;s important to approach it ironically</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.200" end="00:34:52.250" style="s2">what I mean by that it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.820" end="00:34:56.300" style="s2">approach it knowing it will</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.250" end="00:34:58.430" style="s2">not be it will not fulfill the function</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.300" end="00:35:01.340" style="s2">in its full Gestalt form it will not</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.430" end="00:35:04.940" style="s2">fulfill the function that the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.340" end="00:35:08.750" style="s2">axial religion fulfilled at least not</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.940" end="00:35:13.780" style="s2">for a very very long time if at all and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.750" end="00:35:16.610" style="s2">if ever so I think that having been</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.780" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">having measured expectations is like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.610" end="00:35:22.490" style="s2">supreme understatement here okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:25.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of I think you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.490" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">have to keep due reverence for what has</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.970" end="00:35:30.860" style="s2">passed even if it&#39;s no longer present to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:34.670" style="s2">you even if you no longer feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.860" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">feel moved and breathe by it meaning by</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.670" end="00:35:42.980" style="s2">it I mean let&#39;s say you know the Western</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:45.260" style="s2">religions that has now that have now</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.980" end="00:35:47.300" style="s2">been subject to centuries of sequential</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:49.370" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t feel those breathing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.300" end="00:35:51.640" style="s2">you still and I&#39;m I&#39;m a case in point</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.370" end="00:35:54.770" style="s2">because I find it very very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.640" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">become possessed of the faith that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.770" end="00:36:02.450" style="s2">necessary to be a true and authentic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:05.360" style="s2">pious believer I find that very</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.450" end="00:36:07.340" style="s2">difficult but even absent that I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.360" end="00:36:09.890" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.340" end="00:36:12.470" style="s2">the complexity of the functions that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.890" end="00:36:16.940" style="s2">they serve and how we cannot simply</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.470" end="00:36:18.860" style="s2">reproduce those functions with with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.940" end="00:36:20.120" style="s2">feature list of design features now that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.860" end="00:36:23.000" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.120" end="00:36:24.140" style="s2">John and Jordan Hall and company I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.000" end="00:36:26.180" style="s2">saying that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.140" end="00:36:29.510" style="s2">understand the scope gravity of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.180" end="00:36:30.740" style="s2">problem as well as I do and that so</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.510" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing but</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.740" end="00:36:34.130" style="s2">they&#39;re undertaking this task I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:36.140" style="s2">with that irony but I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.130" end="00:36:38.030" style="s2">important that everyone who&#39;s taking an</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.140" end="00:36:40.310" style="s2">ancillary interest in that project and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.030" end="00:36:46.910" style="s2">feeding into it understands the irony</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.310" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">and you know and understands that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.910" end="00:36:50.330" style="s2">not simply that suddenly a series of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:53.480" style="s2">experiments are going to produce a new</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.330" end="00:36:55.580" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not how it works and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">I think anyone who thinks that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.580" end="00:37:02.300" style="s2">how it works</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:03.830" style="s2">has has grossly underestimated the the</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.400" end="00:38:27.980" style="s2">little bit of feedback I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:31.430" style="s2">it&#39;s me or is anybody else getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.980" end="00:38:43.820" style="s2">feedback on Chris or is it just me right</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.820" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">give me one second whether I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.080" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">leave in and come back one second</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.770" end="00:39:00.070" style="s2">and let&#39;s try to close some windows</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.290" end="00:39:11.460" style="s2">it&#39;s nating especially to be embedded</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:16.220" style="s2">within it to see how it&#39;s forming up it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.460" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">it reminds me less of truly a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.220" end="00:39:21.180" style="s2">groundswell of a religious movement and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.860" style="s2">more like symposium or something more</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.180" end="00:39:25.050" style="s2">like one of the ancient Greek schools</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.860" end="00:39:26.820" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the the sense I get more</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.050" end="00:39:28.470" style="s2">of it just being around it that the that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.820" end="00:39:30.540" style="s2">the ideas are clustered around these</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.470" end="00:39:32.550" style="s2">kinds of central themes and it&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:34.020" style="s2">to make sense of the world and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.550" end="00:39:36.060" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some like political</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.970" end="00:47:44.490" style="s2">unified and collective adaptation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.570" end="00:47:46.619" style="s2">really interesting but it does kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.490" end="00:47:50.490" style="s2">represent a really interesting strategic</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.619" end="00:47:52.470" style="s2">niche right like English dramatists</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.490" end="00:47:54.390" style="s2">because they followed Shakespeare got</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.470" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">really really good at doing it so</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.390" end="00:47:58.470" style="s2">there&#39;s something to that expertise</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:01.800" style="s2">component that is meaningful I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.470" end="00:48:04.109" style="s2">but and at least an hour time it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.800" end="00:48:06.990" style="s2">seem necessary when there are too many</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.109" end="00:48:10.350" style="s2">elements in the world for us to cogently</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.990" end="00:48:12.390" style="s2">examine on our own to distribute that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.350" end="00:48:14.130" style="s2">amongst ourselves and then to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.390" end="00:48:16.290" style="s2">reliable network of that distributed</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.130" end="00:48:17.609" style="s2">trust so that we can make sense of all</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.290" end="00:48:20.430" style="s2">the elements that we can&#39;t match on our</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.609" end="00:48:22.109" style="s2">own so there&#39;s some some element of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.430" end="00:48:23.550" style="s2">strategy that won&#39;t work here and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.109" end="00:48:26.220" style="s2">the collective wisdom that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.550" end="00:48:28.260" style="s2">searching for is both levelling up our</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.220" end="00:48:31.890" style="s2">capacity to transmit how we see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.260" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">world and then developing a trust what</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.890" end="00:48:37.260" style="s2">people do think so so I&#39;m right in line</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.930" style="s2">with that component of whatever John is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.260" end="00:48:42.600" style="s2">working on right like if that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.930" end="00:48:44.250" style="s2">from this whole process I think it will</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.600" end="00:48:46.980" style="s2">be truly something special right it will</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.250" end="00:48:49.230" style="s2">be either the wedding component of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.980" end="00:48:51.960" style="s2">technological layer and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.230" end="00:48:55.350" style="s2">this shapes everything that we do at in</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.960" end="00:48:57.960" style="s2">in this scale and then our own inner</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.350" end="00:49:06.300" style="s2">capacity to develop these these networks</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.960" end="00:49:13.109" style="s2">of and yeah all right so what to LA she</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.300" end="00:49:15.510" style="s2">al has a question thank you yeah so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.109" end="00:49:17.340" style="s2">is an ideology what should we pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.510" end="00:49:18.810" style="s2">careful attention to so the religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.340" end="00:49:25.550" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion doesn&#39;t devolve</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.810" end="00:49:30.740" style="s2">into a pseudo religious ideology hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:30.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question um I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.460" end="00:49:41.750" style="s2">I think one possible definition of an</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:43.160" style="s2">ideology and so far as I understand well</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.750" end="00:49:45.620" style="s2">let&#39;s take I mean let&#39;s take the rid of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.160" end="00:49:50.330" style="s2">the word right it is a it is a logos for</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.620" end="00:49:55.000" style="s2">the organization of ideas so it is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.330" end="00:49:59.120" style="s2">kind of mechanism of heuristics that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.000" end="00:50:04.550" style="s2">organize the meaning of any given set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.120" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">information and conforming it to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.550" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">particular way of knowing and way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">seeing the world so that is I think one</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:23.900" style="s2">of the one of the properties of an</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:35.020" style="s2">ideology is that it tends to be hold</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.900" end="00:50:35.020" style="s2">phenomena in a way that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.060" end="00:50:42.950" style="s2">concentrates them all into the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.650" end="00:50:45.650" style="s2">point of closure that is a way of</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.370" end="00:51:05.530" style="s2">from one situation to the mass so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.670" end="00:51:08.650" style="s2">one of the one of the things that makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.530" end="00:51:12.680" style="s2">nationalism for instance ideological is</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.650" end="00:51:16.610" style="s2">that every problem becomes a problem of</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.150" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">of relevance that frames every kind of</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.470" end="00:52:22.040" style="s2">rather than to allow the introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.440" end="00:52:24.200" style="s2">a novel or a novel book to reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.040" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">the set of criteria by which I know a</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:36.110" style="s2">nationalism for instance and I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.190" end="00:52:38.660" style="s2">a person who is in disagreement with me</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.110" end="00:52:42.110" style="s2">propositional about my let&#39;s say my</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.020" end="00:52:52.340" style="s2">otherwise clearly has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.910" end="00:52:54.920" style="s2">independent value and virtue that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.340" end="00:52:59.600" style="s2">could benefit from the ideological</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.920" end="00:53:01.730" style="s2">person oh and I&#39;m being a little bit I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.600" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">taking this to its extremes I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.730" end="00:53:05.360" style="s2">for the purpose of illustrating it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">you know the the supremely ideological</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.360" end="00:53:10.310" style="s2">person would dismiss that second person</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:15.860" style="s2">head of Han whatever other qualities</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.310" end="00:53:18.890" style="s2">they seems to possess or introduce they</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.860" end="00:53:21.800" style="s2">could not be accommodated because they</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.890" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">were not consistent with the criteria by</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.800" end="00:53:27.650" style="s2">which all things are meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:30.110" style="s2">important namely by importance to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.650" end="00:53:32.390" style="s2">nation or by agreement nation so I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.110" end="00:53:34.010" style="s2">that I mean you know without getting to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.390" end="00:53:36.710" style="s2">polemical without it I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.010" end="00:53:39.710" style="s2">seeing a lot of that right now a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.710" end="00:53:41.240" style="s2">the conversations around around social</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.710" end="00:53:43.820" style="s2">justice I think give us some good</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.240" end="00:53:46.490" style="s2">examples about this because regardless</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.820" end="00:53:50.270" style="s2">of you notwithstanding the merit of any</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.490" end="00:53:54.320" style="s2">one proposal you know what they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.270" end="00:53:57.140" style="s2">do oftentimes is have a way of framing a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.320" end="00:53:58.760" style="s2">problem and then any time a new problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.140" end="00:54:00.920" style="s2">or a new situation and count</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.760" end="00:54:03.110" style="s2">encountered that frame then becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.920" end="00:54:05.480" style="s2">way of knowing how that problem is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.110" end="00:54:10.340" style="s2">important to the exclusion of all other</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.480" end="00:54:13.880" style="s2">ways so yeah I think that would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.340" end="00:54:16.060" style="s2">a bit of a it&#39;s a rough scaffold but</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.880" end="00:54:18.560" style="s2">that would be the definition I thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.060" end="00:54:20.450" style="s2">is that is that helpful you want to hold</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.560" end="00:54:24.200" style="s2">off on that no I think it&#39;s follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.450" end="00:54:28.040" style="s2">it&#39;s so how should we what can we do to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.200" end="00:54:31.640" style="s2">avoid falling into the the pseudo reel</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.040" end="00:54:35.780" style="s2">into a pseudo religious ideology so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.640" end="00:54:37.850" style="s2">well I mean one of the classics very</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.780" end="00:54:39.860" style="s2">classical ways of doing it is using</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.850" end="00:54:46.940" style="s2">something less like a Socratic alingas</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.860" end="00:54:51.230" style="s2">you know which is to - we just - deny</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.940" end="00:54:54.010" style="s2">yourself the very is to deny yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.230" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">the givenness of the proposition to</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.010" end="00:55:02.630" style="s2">allow for yourself to lapse into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:04.160" style="s2">genuine mode of ignorance right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:07.370" style="s2">one thing that Socrates does is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.160" end="00:55:10.220" style="s2">continually presents new versions new</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.370" end="00:55:12.470" style="s2">species of a definition to show that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.220" end="00:55:14.810" style="s2">originating definition of any given term</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.470" end="00:55:17.210" style="s2">is lacking that it does not accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.810" end="00:55:19.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not accommodating with the totality</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.210" end="00:55:22.490" style="s2">of its all of its possible referees</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.250" end="00:55:24.380" style="s2">right and he does that to show that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.490" end="00:55:26.330" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of definitional</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.380" end="00:55:29.240" style="s2">instability to speech and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.330" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">we proffer it and an ideological mode of</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.240" end="00:55:35.860" style="s2">thinking takes speech as absolute it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:39.110" style="s2">takes speech it takes the denotative</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.860" end="00:55:41.930" style="s2">structure of speech as as absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.110" end="00:55:43.940" style="s2">prescriptive and and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.930" end="00:55:47.000" style="s2">that the Socratic Alenko process does is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.940" end="00:55:51.620" style="s2">it dispossesses the literal speech of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.000" end="00:55:55.400" style="s2">its capacity to envelop ever more and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.620" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">ever more numerous problems so so</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.400" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">something like I mean so I know that I</p>

<p begin="01:12:56.560" end="01:13:02.980" style="s2">phenomenal way for people to come to</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.160" end="01:13:05.980" style="s2">understand something like the potential</p>

<p begin="01:13:44.760" end="01:13:52.380" style="s2">enough to place yourself in the hands of</p>

<p begin="01:14:10.170" end="01:14:14.460" style="s2">say I I think I can speak for all of us</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.900" end="01:14:17.340" style="s2">that we&#39;re grateful you overcame your</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.460" end="01:14:21.140" style="s2">reluctance and and and decided to join</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.340" end="01:14:23.460" style="s2">us today this has been been great</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.140" end="01:14:24.300" style="s2">gesture be good you were speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.460" end="01:14:27.780" style="s2">poesis</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.300" end="01:14:30.300" style="s2">if can you ask Christopher how poesis</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.780" end="01:14:31.650" style="s2">comes to him and through him in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.300" end="01:14:33.270" style="s2">context of beautifully structured</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.650" end="01:14:35.100" style="s2">language and now G if he could define</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.270" end="01:14:38.690" style="s2">poesis for for everyone while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.100" end="01:14:38.690" style="s2">answering this that would be great</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.510" end="01:14:49.530" style="s2">define poesis well I mean III suppose I</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.060" end="01:14:54.690" style="s2">suppose most basically poesis is</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.530" end="01:15:01.050" style="s2">creation if and if we mean it we mean it</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.690" end="01:15:05.940" style="s2">linguistically then it is it is the it</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.050" end="01:15:08.850" style="s2">is the it is the invocation of the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.940" end="01:15:10.890" style="s2">in the matter of speech I mean one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.850" end="01:15:13.890" style="s2">the things that poetry good poetry does</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.890" end="01:15:16.890" style="s2">is poetry turns language against itself</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.890" end="01:15:18.450" style="s2">and ruptures itself open I had I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.890" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">remember who said this I wish I could</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.450" end="01:15:21.180" style="s2">attribute it properly but I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:24.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard a lot there&#39;s a quote that</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.180" end="01:15:27.480" style="s2">you know good good good poetry strives</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.450" end="01:15:30.840" style="s2">for its own extinction</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.480" end="01:15:33.600" style="s2">it keeps to emancipate itself from the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.840" end="01:15:36.360" style="s2">linguistic boundaries from which it</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.600" end="01:15:38.700" style="s2">originated well from perhaps not from</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.360" end="01:15:49.080" style="s2">which it originated but in which it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.700" end="01:15:53.370" style="s2">formed and and that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.080" end="01:15:56.160" style="s2">poetry which has now become so strange</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.370" end="01:16:01.890" style="s2">from the project of the contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.160" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">philosophy is its it I think it has to</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.890" end="01:16:08.390" style="s2">be reintroduced those two need to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:11.390" style="s2">remarried the poet and philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.390" end="01:16:13.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a quote about I sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.390" end="01:16:15.000" style="s2">shooting a few different directions here</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.350" end="01:16:18.000" style="s2">but I&#39;ll come back to the question but</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.000" end="01:16:19.410" style="s2">it reminds me there&#39;s a is a quote I</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.000" end="01:16:22.250" style="s2">think I can&#39;t remember for this</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.410" end="01:16:27.390" style="s2">Heidegger or liner Schumann Sherman who</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.250" end="01:16:32.790" style="s2">who who wrote up Heidegger said that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.390" end="01:16:35.400" style="s2">know philosophy philosophy opens the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.790" end="01:16:39.150" style="s2">by which an unutterable experience may</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.400" end="01:16:42.810" style="s2">be given and that&#39;s why philosopher is</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.150" end="01:16:46.140" style="s2">just like the poets I think when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.810" end="01:16:48.630" style="s2">working at their best they use language</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.140" end="01:16:53.570" style="s2">in such a way they bend it against</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.630" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">itself as to create from it openings</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.570" end="01:17:05.220" style="s2">through which the ineffable and for</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:08.120" style="s2">truth and I think that a lot of that in</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.220" end="01:17:08.120" style="s2">translation</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.690" end="01:17:19.740" style="s2">so poesis in the context of philosophy I</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.210" end="01:17:24.750" style="s2">think is using the affordances of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.740" end="01:17:28.070" style="s2">language to try and gesture simply just</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.750" end="01:17:30.360" style="s2">you&#39;re beyond its meaning that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.070" end="01:17:32.430" style="s2">celebrated the philosophers that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.360" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">perhaps most celebrated are the ones</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.430" end="01:17:37.020" style="s2">that have managed to do that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:40.120" style="s2">ones that have managed to this enter a</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.020" end="01:17:43.150" style="s2">world from within speak</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.120" end="01:17:45.400" style="s2">and pronounced it upon us in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.150" end="01:17:47.500" style="s2">that we could find ourselves in it and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.400" end="01:17:49.540" style="s2">living through it I mean that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.500" end="01:17:51.850" style="s2">Heidegger is haigha digger right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.540" end="01:17:53.380" style="s2">why he Heidegger is so revered it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.850" end="01:17:55.060" style="s2">precisely because he does that because</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.380" end="01:17:57.730" style="s2">you travel through Heidegger you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.060" end="01:18:07.270" style="s2">read him and you travel through Plato</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.730" end="01:18:08.590" style="s2">you don&#39;t um I think the question that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.270" end="01:18:12.070" style="s2">think the question asked me about myself</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.590" end="01:18:16.150" style="s2">for my own process can you remind me yes</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.070" end="01:18:18.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just one sec if there how poesis</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.150" end="01:18:20.200" style="s2">comes to you and through you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.520" end="01:18:26.560" style="s2">in the context of beautifully structured</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.200" end="01:18:28.270" style="s2">language no it does it I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.560" end="01:18:29.740" style="s2">don&#39;t even know it&#39;s the premise of the</p>

<p begin="01:18:29.740" end="01:18:36.220" style="s2">have sent to or not um well if I should</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.160" end="01:18:37.990" style="s2">be so lucky and agree with its premise I</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.220" end="01:18:38.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know where to go from</p>

<p begin="01:22:47.370" end="01:22:56.250" style="s2">know what it&#39;s so it&#39;s funny I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.520" end="01:22:58.020" style="s2">as I&#39;m not as duration to reader I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.250" end="01:23:01.890" style="s2">I obviously there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.020" end="01:23:03.110" style="s2">that kind of required even to stay up to</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.890" end="01:23:06.390" style="s2">speed with these kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.110" end="01:23:09.750" style="s2">but I&#39;m not as voracious a reader as I</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.390" end="01:23:11.270" style="s2">think well certainly not as much as</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.750" end="01:23:15.810" style="s2">someone like Jonathan boys that</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.270" end="01:23:29.280" style="s2">important people there and but but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.810" end="01:23:33.930" style="s2">would say I a lot of my my my sources of</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.280" end="01:23:38.790" style="s2">influence are really not dissimilar from</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.930" end="01:23:44.750" style="s2">the sources of influence that that that</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.790" end="01:23:44.750" style="s2">Jon tends to refer to in his lectures</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.180" end="01:23:49.320" style="s2">Plato and páginas featured very</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.320" end="01:23:53.640" style="s2">very very prominently tillich as well</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.690" end="01:23:56.700" style="s2">which is very prominently increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.640" end="01:24:02.220" style="s2">high degree and then secondary sources</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.700" end="01:24:04.350" style="s2">that refer to those primary ones but you</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.220" end="01:24:06.360" style="s2">know what&#39;s funny is that I I find</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.350" end="01:24:07.980" style="s2">myself sorry I&#39;m I&#39;m answering a</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.360" end="01:24:09.660" style="s2">question that you didn&#39;t ask but it</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.980" end="01:24:10.680" style="s2">seems more honest than to try and answer</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.660" end="01:24:15.750" style="s2">your question directly</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.680" end="01:24:17.670" style="s2">okay good okay thank you I hope you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.750" end="01:24:23.640" style="s2">take that again in the spirit its</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.670" end="01:24:25.050" style="s2">intended but I find that I become so my</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.640" end="01:24:27.660" style="s2">experience with reading is very odd</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.050" end="01:24:30.750" style="s2">because it tends to spin me off very</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.660" end="01:24:32.850" style="s2">quickly I seldom get through books</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.750" end="01:24:37.260" style="s2">because I&#39;m so preoccupied with my</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.850" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">marginalia in those books that that I</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.260" end="01:24:41.970" style="s2">get endlessly distracted them in the</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.620" end="01:24:55.950" style="s2">consume them I live off of that and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.830" end="01:24:58.170" style="s2">is I don&#39;t say this proudly because in</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.950" end="01:25:00.420" style="s2">many ways it frustrates this fiscal</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.420" end="01:25:05.970" style="s2">frustrates me because it means that I</p>

<p begin="01:25:05.970" end="01:25:11.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t love anything for very long</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.070" end="01:25:12.720" style="s2">before spinning out and doing something</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.610" end="01:25:16.980" style="s2">entirely different</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.380" end="01:25:24.060" style="s2">good thing and yet for whatever reason I</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.989" end="01:25:28.230" style="s2">actually can&#39;t stop myself in doing it</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.060" end="01:25:32.790" style="s2">something far more improvising my way</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.230" end="01:25:35.489" style="s2">around or around paper or around an</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.790" end="01:25:41.640" style="s2">argument rather than committing it</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.489" end="01:25:45.030" style="s2">patently to lexical knowledge I think in</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.640" end="01:25:47.790" style="s2">that way my ability and my approach to</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.030" end="01:25:50.130" style="s2">these things is far more political than</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.790" end="01:25:54.180" style="s2">it is classically philosophic or</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.130" end="01:25:56.930" style="s2">classically academic and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.180" end="01:25:58.880" style="s2">struggle with that</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.930" end="01:26:02.150" style="s2">because sometimes it&#39;s appropriate and</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.880" end="01:26:04.220" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s adaptive and serves me</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.150" end="01:26:09.980" style="s2">well and sometimes it is not</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.220" end="01:26:14.180" style="s2">and sometimes it is officers so I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.980" end="01:26:18.400" style="s2">say there is no you know my thinking</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.180" end="01:26:21.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t anchor itself in any secret text</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:23.480" style="s2">it has much more to do with the way I</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.140" end="01:26:28.490" style="s2">relate to the texts that are canonical</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.480" end="01:26:30.710" style="s2">to most people and so if there&#39;s a if</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.490" end="01:26:33.470" style="s2">you&#39;re asking after a secret sauce or</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.710" end="01:26:35.930" style="s2">anything like that I suppose that would</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.470" end="01:26:37.430" style="s2">be the best way of framing sorry that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.930" end="01:26:41.120" style="s2">was that didn&#39;t answer your question but</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.430" end="01:26:43.640" style="s2">now it did actually okay because you</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.120" end="01:26:47.210" style="s2">said you young in the the ideas around</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.640" end="01:26:49.420" style="s2">him and chemical texts when I like that</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.210" end="01:26:52.460" style="s2">marry by a man who&#39;s now a reverend and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.420" end="01:26:54.650" style="s2">he gave me his books quite a few of his</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.460" end="01:26:57.080" style="s2">books right before he moved and then on</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.650" end="01:26:59.450" style="s2">the move everything he owned burned so I</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.080" end="01:27:02.480" style="s2">have his only booked his notes</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.450" end="01:27:04.790" style="s2">you know his glossary is marginal yet I</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.480" end="01:27:06.650" style="s2">have all his notes and stuff and that</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.790" end="01:27:09.710" style="s2">book is so much more powerful just</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.650" end="01:27:12.620" style="s2">because I have his thoughts in the book</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.710" end="01:27:14.780" style="s2">also so I think I kind of see what you</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.620" end="01:27:17.660" style="s2">said when you say you start to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.780" end="01:27:19.610" style="s2">move in a in those things and then you</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.660" end="01:27:22.580" style="s2">kind of get spun off maybe but you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.610" end="01:27:24.350" style="s2">actually consuming them properly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.580" end="01:27:28.670" style="s2">not just trying to get through them to</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.350" end="01:27:29.270" style="s2">say you rent the book thank you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.670" end="01:27:32.710" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.270" end="01:27:32.710" style="s2">yo you&#39;ve you&#39;ve taken my meaning</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.190" end="01:27:45.890" style="s2">Adrian you had a question yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.620" end="01:27:49.370" style="s2">have you had a bill to hand book the</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.890" end="01:27:52.190" style="s2">burden of society and if yes what do you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.370" end="01:27:57.740" style="s2">think about it I haven&#39;t read that when</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.190" end="01:28:00.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve read I read the sense of time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.740" end="01:28:03.560" style="s2">I&#39;m his his books are like high up in</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.920" end="01:28:06.590" style="s2">the queue they&#39;re high up in the queue</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.560" end="01:28:09.650" style="s2">so I can&#39;t speak to the grant Society</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.590" end="01:28:12.170" style="s2">specifically I can say that the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.650" end="01:28:14.930" style="s2">it had a huge influence on my thinking</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.170" end="01:28:17.330" style="s2">and and incidentally you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.930" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">talking about form and style young</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.330" end="01:28:23.860" style="s2">Chauhan is a very interesting example</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:25.880" style="s2">because he has a way of writing I</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.860" end="01:28:27.860" style="s2">remember thinking to myself after</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.880" end="01:28:31.640" style="s2">reading the sense of time that there was</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.860" end="01:28:34.340" style="s2">a lot of repetition a lot of formal</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.640" end="01:28:36.230" style="s2">repetition stylistic repetition in his</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.340" end="01:28:39.500" style="s2">book even though it&#39;s a very short book</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.230" end="01:28:41.930" style="s2">and I can I know I have a similar</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.500" end="01:28:44.810" style="s2">tendency when especially when writing</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.930" end="01:28:47.270" style="s2">about something whose core components</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.810" end="01:28:49.430" style="s2">are not yet clear even to me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.270" end="01:28:52.070" style="s2">lot of circling around something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.430" end="01:28:54.380" style="s2">a lot of revolution that happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.070" end="01:28:57.020" style="s2">writing process and I hope I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.380" end="01:28:59.450" style="s2">interpolate Americana&#39;s concern but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.020" end="01:29:01.790" style="s2">can actually see a lot of that I feel as</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.450" end="01:29:04.520" style="s2">though when I read Han in the limited</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.790" end="01:29:07.510" style="s2">way that I&#39;ve done I can feel his</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.520" end="01:29:11.390" style="s2">process of reckoning I can feel his</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.510" end="01:29:13.970" style="s2">contemplative process in the form of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.390" end="01:29:17.900" style="s2">way he writes in addition to the content</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.970" end="01:29:20.150" style="s2">that was writing I can feel the world of</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.900" end="01:29:22.460" style="s2">his text and I can feel it</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.150" end="01:29:25.370" style="s2">I can feel its recursions and</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.460" end="01:29:27.470" style="s2">repetitions as a way of lathering me</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.370" end="01:29:33.740" style="s2">further and further and further into its</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.470" end="01:29:35.420" style="s2">insight um so anyway that that yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.740" end="01:29:36.740" style="s2">can&#39;t speak to the burnt-out society but</p>
