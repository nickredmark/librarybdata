<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">seems at least partially fact-based</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t all opinion</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">like who&#39;s the best star war character</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">um would be a bad example</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">but something that real world if if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">could think of someone that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">debate with and this would it&#39;d be good</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">um that&#39;s been up still waiting on the</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">but while i&#39;m working on that i&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">the next step is probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a platform to help</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">build what i&#39;m calling portals like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">wikilection where it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">information sites that would share</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">from the same root information source uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been working on the specs for</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">uh and when that&#39;s ready then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">probably be working with bentley and</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">help manage some developers probably in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">india or</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">in just you know hired on upwork</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">uh to start coding the platform and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where i&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">all right is it my turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">so right now i&#39;m working on a project</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">called catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">um and recently i made some significant</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">progress in last few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">the the problem that the platform is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">solving is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">information overload specifically and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">um not enough how i see it actionable</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">on traditional social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">and so even i myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">have been like with quarantine and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">doing my things and spending a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">screen time on like facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">and instagram and like that just</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">scrolling</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">um and there is a definite like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">addicting</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">quality to like the reward system of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">scrolling but i</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">do it because i want it connected to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">some sort of actual information things i</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">could do</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">ways i can help people ways i can impact</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">new things that i might that might help</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">me in my personal life</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">and so the idea is basically creating a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">platform where instead of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">an algorithm determining what you are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">basically set out intention in what sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">of information resources people you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">to get connected with</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">and when you go on the platform it</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">basically um</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">through a series of filters lets you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">filter your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">and create your kind of own feeds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">right now obviously that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">undertaking so my initial prototype that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">i just finished</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">has basically the capability to go into</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">um rooms which are basically like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">fellowship room</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">project room startup funding room</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">and then within those rooms there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">hundreds of each type</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">of that information and you can filter</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">and sort them by five different metrics</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">i&#39;m using webflow so it&#39;s a no code</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">solution and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">webflow has like a limit of five</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">multi-reference fields and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">um you can filter by location by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">person like</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">is this useful for an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">someone of faith</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">um by the type of information the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">topic and also the room that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">um so i just got the filtering</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">capability finished</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">and i also have a prototype of the site</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">that i&#39;m still kind of</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">sure um yeah let me think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">so for the hot seat what do you guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">typically uh what what is the typical</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">end goal yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">anyone to ask for help on their project</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s very varied um so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">whatever the individual needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">um and honestly we haven&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">times we haven&#39;t had someone on the hot</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">seat because all of us kind of know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">we&#39;re doing on our project and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t really need any help so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">haven&#39;t done it a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">it could definitely be anything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">that you would you would find valuable</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">undivided attention of three other</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">people okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">so that sounds good um in that case i</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">think the two questions that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">um i would want to kind of revolve it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">around would be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">one um in the current design</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">is this is the information like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">understandable in</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">in this way um that would be the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">one and the second one</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">is is something like this valuable</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">enough that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">consider spending time on it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">instead of being on a social platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">which is a lot more like</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">alive so to say um</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">like and you know if so is it something</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">that would be worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">like paying for in any regards those are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">kind of like assumptions that i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">to test right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">excellent all right so i have not screen</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">shared on this yet so give me a second</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just down at the bottom if you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">see the little tabs mute stop cam</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">there&#39;s one that says share screen and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">then we&#39;ll pop it up on them</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">where the four of us are i have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">tabs open so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">well when you when you share a screen if</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">you&#39;re in chrome it&#39;ll give you the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">option to share it there we go</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">it so you can put up whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">in there and then i&#39;ll put it up on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">okay cool all right so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">current site</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">um i am signed in um this is a home page</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">so basically um</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">beginning there&#39;s just ways to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">like filter through the information so</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll start with like the highest sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">category so networks are open spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">aggregating</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">aggregating crowdsourced knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">these could be issues like chronovirus</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">domains like education</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">cooperative economics and so within each</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">one of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">if we go into let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">so each</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">each domain has its own sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">homepage</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">where you can kind of like see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">um the rooms that are inside of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">network so these are like the specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">types of information that are in it so</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">startup funding</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">career change and hackathons and then i</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:09.440" style="s2">also have</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">a youtube playlist that&#39;s embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.440" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">each one</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">and the idea is making like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">crowdsourced</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">youtube playlist for each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">topics that anyone can add to and submit</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">to from the site</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">so we can kind of create like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">knowledge base of like the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">videos for each one of these domains</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">so within the rooms if you&#39;re signed in</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">as a member you can also like</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">save and unsave different rooms</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">and you can also follow or unfollow</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">different networks</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">and once you do that also have members</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">that are inside of these and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">kind of like the members profile</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">so going into the room so i&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">startup funding because this is one that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">i kind of populated with the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">information thus far</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">so this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">the card view so i&#39;m working on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">layout a little bit because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">even even a lot more information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">kind of on these cards right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">which i have on each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">so these are all different funding</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">sources and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">you can either change the view so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">going to map view and now you get all</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">these resources on</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">a map</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">and you kind of open them up</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">individually or you can switch back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:38.839" style="s2">the card view</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">and then also have search functionality</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">which i&#39;m not sure exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">how to prompt this but you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">search by almost anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">that&#39;s in the card so for example new</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">york this is like all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">funding opportunities accelerators</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">capital incubators that are in new york</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">and you can also filter it by type</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">so let&#39;s say you want capital focus</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">and it&#39;ll show you like how many results</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">for each one</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">and you can reset the filters um</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">obviously a hard part of this was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">getting the filters to not be insane</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">because there&#39;s like 300 countries</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">so for each room it has like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">customizable</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">set of filters that that make it like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">not very overwhelming for the user</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">um and then you also have like a post</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">functionality where you can post</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">into this room</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll stop there so far if anyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">to jump in with anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">or tell me where to go next is that a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">quick question at the moment when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">say i could post in here does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">it becomes a card or does it become</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">yes so the idea is if these are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">crowd source knowledge bases that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">can add to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">um and so i don&#39;t have it set up yet but</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">basically when you post</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;ll have a little form and it&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">all the fields specific to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">uh this room and then you can add to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">and when you add to it you would also</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">points um and the idea that i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">kind of flesh out right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">there&#39;s like a commons</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">of knowledge and when you add to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">commons of knowledge you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">you like almost have ownership over a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">certain percentage of the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">as it grows</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">obviously your percentage decreases but</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">um there will be some sort of value</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">that you might receive back um</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">from the network if you are an owner of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">knowledge that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">comments basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">so i i&#39;m trying to think because i i</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">think i got a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">mis and you&#39;ve showed this to me before</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">i think but i</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">i think i&#39;ve completely forgotten it</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">since she last showed it to me so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">kind of like coming in fresh</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">um i thought that it was a feed</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">which implies new information coming in</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">but really this is a knowledge commons</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">right so this one is actually i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">change it up like it&#39;s catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">directory and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">this is like all of the um information</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">that is on the site and it&#39;s not as much</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">as a feed it&#39;s more of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">you have an intention to find something</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">and you can go here and find it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">however um</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">there is a dashboard page um</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">where i&#39;m starting to work on more of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">feed it&#39;s a little more complicated to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">do this with no code</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">um so the feed right now is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">you have all of the different joined</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">rooms and networks</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">you can see all of your like saved posts</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">and then what i&#39;m also working on is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">notification so for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">say i want to like i want to save this</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">or notif</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">be notified for this startup accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">because i just missed the deadline</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">and i want to know when it&#39;s open again</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">for next year</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to kind of help people</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">stay on top of and manage opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">so that could be a fellowship that only</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">happens once a year an accelerator uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">an event a sort of like volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">um so trying to help people kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.039" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">stay on top of notification so basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">as like</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">something that you&#39;re following gets</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">updated in terms of like the date</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">then it would show up here um so yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">don&#39;t have like a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">feed yet um</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s something that i hope to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">develop potentially in the next</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">prototype which is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">a no code um yeah i mean the the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">thing that i can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">is based off of the information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">in someone&#39;s profile it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">work around</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">um but let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">so when you go to someone&#39;s profile you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">can basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">you can see like the things that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">submitted you also have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">to see the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">passively match the attributes in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">profile</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">so real quick i&#39;ll show you guys what</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">the kind of like fursonas look like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">so like facebook kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">automatically puts you in these like</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">kind of buckets</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">of like we think that you&#39;re this type</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">of person and they try to like</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">tag you and all these um</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">basically things to like show you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">relevant ads</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">and so the idea is obviously in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">platform where we&#39;re not collecting</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">data and selling it it is up to you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">basically tell the platform like</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">what kind of stuff you want to see so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">um if you consider yourself a gamer</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">then you can kind of subscribe to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">gamer tag</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">you could go here and just look at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">the resources for gamer it&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">like all the new ones</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">or so this is kind of like a reddit like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">a subreddit or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">you can when you&#39;re making your profile</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">like check off like i&#39;m a farmer</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">i am a systems thinker i am spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;ll base your feed eventually will</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">kind of like show you the information</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">been recently added that matches these</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">as well as the other things in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">profile like which</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">rooms you joined which um and which</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">networks you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">so a couple of thoughts uh one is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">interesting challenge with knowledge um</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">repositories or commons is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">making sure well is knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">things are up to date because often they</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">get stale pretty quick</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">yeah and then also a process of keeping</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">things up to date i even</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">often frustrated by blo like i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">technical space so</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">often someone do a blog post about using</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">a technology but they won&#39;t mention what</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">version the tech was</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">and of course in you know a month later</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">that could be um</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">wrong um so at least having the date</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">that the content was</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">created the date it was last updated</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">and then uh and of course you&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">maxed out your filters in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">technology but being able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">filter on that and wait for people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">update it or it&#39;s even more important</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">than whether or not it&#39;s updated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">just when someone looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">and made sure it&#39;s still correct right</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">the last time it was kind of checked</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">would be something nice and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">have things if they weren&#39;t checked</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">after a certain amount of time and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">may vary by group</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">like tech it&#39;ll happen a lot faster but</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">sustainability processes you know those</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">don&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:45.679" style="s2">those don&#39;t go out of date they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">of evergreen so exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.679" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">but yes something for just future is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">giving some sort of visibility into how</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:54.559" style="s2">stale the information might be and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">hiding it after a certain amount that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">would be something you have to consider</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">or manage by group um but yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really important part because</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of places out there where</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">you go in and these knowledge commons</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">just haven&#39;t been kept up to date</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">which is understandable um but it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">to know when it happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">right so the current the current let me</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">know what you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">i was considering kind of having it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">where like if you upload a resource</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">then you would put a date</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">when that resource like you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">guarantee it fresh until it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">actual you know it&#39;s like the expiration</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">date for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">oh yeah so i have it by by item that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">interesting right so each item</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">if you upload the item you are the best</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">one to say like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">this is a project it&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">change in three weeks or this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">tool kit it&#39;s been here for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve been using it it&#39;s probably going</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">to be here for another two years</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">and so then once that date passes then</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">you kind of get a notification</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">where it&#39;s like almost your</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">responsibility to help keep</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">things updated and if it&#39;s not updated</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">within a certain time period then it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">uh archived on the site until somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">updates it or verifies that it&#39;s updated</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">um so that was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">current scheme that i had especially for</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">projects that was important like keeping</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">projects up to date</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">the idea is like if you submit your own</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">then you put a deadline in which that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">project is no longer visible</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">and you get an email sent to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">automatically saying hey we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">your project down unless you can verify</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">that it&#39;s still up to date</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">or update it and that&#39;s actually what i</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">need help with on the scripting is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">pre-filling form so that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">have to like redo the entire post</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">but they basically like pull the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">information from the previous post into</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">a new form</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">to like update it yeah i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">um i&#39;d i&#39;d also like to have it to where</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">other people can come in and say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">dale because i i know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">if i there&#39;s a big temptation if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">your own project to just put it like 10</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">years out and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">of course the project fails and no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">knows you don&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">because you&#39;re so depressed when it</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out um</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">uh so yeah so also i i i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">interesting idea for people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">saying how evergreen it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">but as long as we maybe when possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">it was a feature feature have a tour</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">people can also kind of say i think this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">is stale</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">or like i you know i went and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">follow it and it&#39;s broken here and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s different here and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">um that would be helpful but yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">hadn&#39;t that&#39;s a good idea to have it by</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">item</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">yeah because yeah sometimes things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">evergreen sometimes but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve already had stuff on this site</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">where i&#39;m like oh no the link broke</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">since i had it great</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s been a month</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">can you for projects is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">go to projects actually this is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">experiment of like a pinterest board</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">view um</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">right now but um eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">basically i have each information type</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think no i can&#39;t switch tabs</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">so each type of each post has the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">following kind of like main categories</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s either a resource</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">or like a tool it&#39;s an event which can</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">go on a calendar</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">it&#39;s an opportunity which an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">could be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">a an offer it could be a request it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">time sensitive like an event</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s something that can be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">attached to other things so like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">project can have multiple opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">a resource could have an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s projects which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">any projects on the site right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t want to have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">people&#39;s like personal information on</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">here until i like</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">secure it i have some in air table that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">of friends that have projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">looking for help</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">um and then saved are actually all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">the ones that specific to my login i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">saved so far</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s just um in what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">all posts sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">it&#39;s media like it&#39;s like all posts</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">don&#39;t actually include all posts because</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">events opportunities and projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t in all posts uh they do i just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have many events</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">opportunities and projects live on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">site i just kind of put a few up to test</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">okay so these are four distinct things</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">or everything fits under all posts</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">everything fits under all posts there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">another category that i haven&#39;t added</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">here which is like basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">resources tools which is basically most</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">what everything is right now so when i</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">go to projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">those are projects that i&#39;ve said yes i</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">want to follow in some way whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">that&#39;s because i want an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">there&#39;s opportunities i actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">do in it or it&#39;s my project and i want</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">other people to do opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">or i just want to watch what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">in it is there a way to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">between those</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">levels of my involvement as the user</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.919" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">yes so that&#39;s so this like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">this tab is only um</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">only posts that have been saved could</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.279" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">also have only projects that have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">saved</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">only events that have been saved that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">kind of just like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">condition so i guess i&#39;m i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">figure out if this stuff should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">in like the dashboard um where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">this is everything you have saved and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">then you can like sub categorize it by</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">the type of information it is or</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">if you go to that page was basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">all the posts on the site i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">kind of be able to like jump in and just</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">on here and then see like the different</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">types</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">um but i also added another little tab</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">so you can kind of like quickly see like</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">you know if i go and save um</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">then it&#39;ll show up here</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if this helps because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">not i&#39;m not a tech person i can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">do no code solutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">but to me it seems if i&#39;m under projects</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">i want what i&#39;ve saved to be at the top</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">like the more relevant i&#39;ve made it the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">more i want it at the top as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">game a where they put the mo</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">who&#39;s paid them by the sponsors at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">top to have like</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">who i&#39;m sponsoring like these are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">ones that i&#39;m dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">and so if i&#39;m that i want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">i want both i want to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">what i&#39;ve saved and see everything that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve saved it&#39;s like the full picture</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">but more importantly if i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">opportunities i want to see the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">opportunities that i&#39;ve said in projects</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">and events that i&#39;ve said are most</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">important at the top right like</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">right like personalized sponsorship i</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know but that&#39;s what&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll let the more techy people give more</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">feedback on the stuff you actually asked</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">so now that is a good question though is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">like what order in which these should</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">um right now the default is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s shown up by the number of um</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">saves that a post has by default</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">so collectively we&#39;ve decided this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">more important than this one as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">to i&#39;ve decided that i care more about</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">acoustic neuromas than diabetes but</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s more people with diabetes than</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">acoustic neuroma</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">i mean but i have had acoustic neuroma</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">which is why i would care about it more</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">that level so i guess if i create like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">feed</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">page the order would be like um</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">time based like if it was just uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to kind of show up in the top</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">maybe um in the like all posts right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">with popularity</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">and then in your posts um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">how to sort it</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">um so i yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">pipe in here and talk about my</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s funny my my philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">uh said or last couple months what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">been thinking about this is that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">deals with feeds but</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">it also i just realized listening to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">this that it deals with sorting on just</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">like any display page</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">so ideally and this is a lot of text so</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">this may not be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:11.440" style="s2">short term but people should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">choose</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">their what algorithm is used to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">sort the display or to sort a feed</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">and it&#39;d be one of the things i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">thinking of is just a general tool</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">that lets you not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">choose an algorithm but have a library a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">public library that people can</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">algorithms and then and then choose from</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">and use them in case they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">um and then some you know general simple</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">things so</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">yeah like in order</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">so if you have a filter and then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">have a time base that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">okay unless the data gets so big that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">it depends on how narrow you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">narrow it down</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;d be interested in exploring</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">solutions that can integrate into this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">prototype</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">um as of right now webflow doesn&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">dynamic sorting</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s only it&#39;s like you have to set the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">sorting um for each page</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.679" style="s2">and then you can&#39;t really change it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">unless you add an additional like script</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.679" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">or javascript on top</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">yeah yeah and then we kind of need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">figure out in the short term what are</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">the sorts and filters that would be kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">of most</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">common um because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">you know we can&#39;t expect you to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">this brand new</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">sorting and filtering library</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">as part of your project right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">and and adrian jubilee if i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">too much i&#39;ll just go ahead and jump in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t know jubilee yet anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">you want to go over before i but i got a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:48.880" style="s2">couple more ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">so i just want one more thing um</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.880" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">in terms i haven&#39;t showed you guys the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">different like views but i do have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">view which is basically an</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">air table embed that i have for like</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">this is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">1300 online free online courses and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">too much to like upload to the site as</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">like an individual card</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">um but within this view you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">obviously use the airtable sorts</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">and groups and filters which is nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">although i don&#39;t like love their</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">their ui as much as it&#39;s not obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">very customizable</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">but that is one option i have is to kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">of like use another</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">um like air table or another um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">spreadsheets kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">embed with built-in sorting um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">something i would like to eventually</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">build but obviously within the no code</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">version of this that&#39;s what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">and then in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">of um other ways to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">use um i like showed it briefly i</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">actually just got this working last</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">night but i have a kumu in bed so</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">anything that has</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:56.159" style="s2">a um</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">plot view i can do like a mind map and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.159" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s all pulling from the same database</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">but this is a database of all different</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">fellowships</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">um and then they&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">connected and categorized by like</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:09.279" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.279" style="s2">uh different tags and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">so you can like for one data set like</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">kind of switch between the different</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">card plot lists</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">different views</p>

<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">similar stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">you&#39;ll like that i&#39;ve been attending for</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">several weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">um well several months maybe uh so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">so i want to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">oh i had another idea but i&#39;ve lost it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s good to your first</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">questions for us</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">um would we would we use this and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">even would we contribute</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">to it um as a resource as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">commons that we financially fund</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">i would be open to both of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">um we&#39;ve certainly in our own group</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">tried to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">create that we&#39;ve created three</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">different versions or four of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">projects piece for things in game b</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">and then you know maybe even game b</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">could be a tag</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">in there if your tech currently allows</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">for something like that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">yeah and then yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">in general as a place to keep up on what</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">tools and stuff are available</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">my only concern is that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">couple other</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">things that of course aren&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">this but do overlap some areas of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">so then it do i have the cognitive time</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">energy to keep this as one of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">resources that fulfill that need</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">those needs so i&#39;d have to kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">how this fits in with everything else um</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">but so it&#39;s so the answer is probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">um i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if i could</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">justify paying</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">i mean i i i contribute to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">things just because i want them to exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">and i use them</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">so i think that that&#39;s good um if like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">for my</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">would it be a business need to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">or a you know there&#39;s a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">the startup community</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">between a vitamin and medicine right</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">kind of nice that people don&#39;t often do</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">it they kind of want it and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">the have to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">um so i think this is kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">vitamin unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">unless you&#39;re a salesperson or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">and these contacts are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">um but yeah so those those are both</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">possibilities and maybe i need to spend</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">a little time getting in there</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">and give you more specific um like i did</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">find it helpful because of this or</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">i&#39;m missing this right right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">like for me with value it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">part of me is paying for this like as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">project holder</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">if i was paying like 10 bucks a month um</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">or whatever for i would want to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">getting volunteers and getting people</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">if that was part marketing then yes i</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">would be willing to put it in if it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">just to be on a different list</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">no if as a user it was more like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">patreon where i&#39;m putting 5-10 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">towards it and then i get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">where that money like it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">projects and going to create things um</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">with part of it of course going to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">the site but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i would pay for just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">site it would be like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">of what that money&#39;s going towards with</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">some going to the site does that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">yeah like i&#39;d want to be involved like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">patreon right i&#39;m not paying for patreon</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">i&#39;m paying for the artists</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">and then patreon takes money and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s in that level is probably where i</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">want to want to want to pay for it okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">hey joel do you have any feedback</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">um so the is the top</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">level item for all this what would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.839" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">say is projects like that sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">most of the information</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">is is centered around or is it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">evenly projects and resources okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">i guess there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">what it is now and what i would like it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">um so right now the main information</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">is tools and resources so that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">um you know like really cool</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">platforms websites toolkits</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">um things that i&#39;ve found over the years</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">was just like wow and then i like very</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">frequently reference people too</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">um and that if i didn&#39;t you know if i</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">wasn&#39;t crazy about like information</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">hoarding and like finding all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">that i would have never found that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">and then i wouldn&#39;t have recommended it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">to other people so that&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">like what i have in my back pocket</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">which is how what it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">made on the site</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">but right now everything on the site is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">more or less</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">um around the idea of social impact and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">the related fields that are in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">most vital to social impact so like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing here for sports</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">but there is for cooperative economics</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in here for like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">fashion or like news unless it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">very informational news article that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">relates to systems design or</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">um and so mostly everything is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">centered around</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">more important issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">um and the idea is that so obviously i</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">would like to make it free for anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">basically go on and like do what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">guys just saw</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">and kind of like filter through the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">information um</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">but i was thinking of making like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">of like a patreon membership tier where</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">you become a catalyst and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">basically the financial contribution</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">will go towards like growing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">comment so like even if you just like</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">subscribe and you use it</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">frequently or occasionally and you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">upload your own things as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">um the money will go towards growing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">this so that it&#39;s kind of a win-win</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">you are also helping creating something</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">the other part is basically want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">create a reward system for like people</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">who help contribute to it they will</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">actually get</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">like paid out for helping build the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">um and the other thing would be to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">basically um like i kind of want my</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">full-time career to be a connector so</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">like i want to reach out to like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">2000</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">climate change organizations that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">found over the last few years and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">ask them like</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">what are the opportunities you have for</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">people what help do you need</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">and how do we kind of like funnel more</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">and time towards things that already</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">exist that are good</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">um and basically making the connections</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">people that otherwise wouldn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">when you know you have i look at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">these facebook pages and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">these facebook groups for like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">climate change organizations they post</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">like three people like it they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">asking for something and then other</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">people post that they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">something and like two people like it</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">and so like i wonder if they&#39;re ever</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.280" style="s2">getting connected and so the idea would</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">be like</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">not just me but having eventually a team</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">of people who are like those connectors</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">and when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">pay to basically be a member then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">also in your profile basically choose</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">what things you want to be connected</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">which could match any of the filters</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">hundreds of tags</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">locations on the site and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">kind of like also</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">focus efforts on trying to find those</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">things and basically send like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">either customizable like email digest or</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">pop it in your like notifications</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">so kind of like also um when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">join the site and you put out your</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">intentions of what you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">then we kind of start shifting focus to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">like what the users need to like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">accomplish their individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">goals i would like it to be centered</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">around kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">game b which is why this is like one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">the first places i&#39;m like really sharing</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">this and i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">make sure that it stays aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">um but that&#39;s that&#39;s the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">idea and then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">hopefully at that point we&#39;d have more</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">resources to start building out the sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">passive connection news feed or you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">other systems like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">i see so when you save resources that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">in essence is that referring to like</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">not individual website but kind of where</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">it might be like the website for</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">um uh start</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">a startup accelerator or something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">that or it could also be like</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">an a news site like cnn.com might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:38.079" style="s2">a resource not the individual articles</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">but just the site</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.079" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">right where the articles are hosted</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">prepare my air table so you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">kind of see into the madness if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">so basically and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:57.599" style="s2">if this is confusing i would love to um</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">get feedback on that but so how i have</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.599" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">it right now is so there&#39;s post types</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">um the main post types as i</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">kind of previously mentioned are events</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">offers</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">organizations projects request</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">resources individuals which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">user and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">discussion which i don&#39;t know if i want</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">that but that&#39;s it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">um so if i go to all types</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">and i group these by the type</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">so basically there are like subtypes</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">for example startup accelerator is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">a subtype of funding but it is also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">um an organization has subtype so like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">you could be a non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">design network activist group and then i</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">tool type which are tools are resources</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">so design tool database</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">chrome plug-in systems mapping tool</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">and then the other things like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">mentioned like so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">content which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">more of like this is an article or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">or a show or a movie like kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">one singular</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">piece of content that you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">consume and then a resource would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:18.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">netflix is a resource because it has</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">multiple pieces of content</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">on it a visualization website is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">a an aggregation website a wiki um</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">a google form a database so like</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">basically i have</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">it very um broadly categorized right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">as something that helps people</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">um achieve a goal and and that is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">um as like</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not as specific as a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">so uh i&#39;m not familiar enough with our</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">table yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.599" style="s2">um can something exist in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">two of those categories and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.599" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">subcategories at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">so each post has a main type and then it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">um other types so you kind of pick like</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">what is the main thing that this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">and that one gets kind of like displayed</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">on the card because i don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">like 10 things being displayed right</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s a main code type and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">everything has a subtype and you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">actually see like</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">these are the posts of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">so these are all the posts that are of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">the main type so like visualization</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">strategic intelligence is a post that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">is the main thing it&#39;s a visualization</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">and then you can see the room that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">and you also see the link of like a list</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">nomad list</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">listopia book list like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">list as well so uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">something maybe to consider for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">future unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">too complex is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">graph ontology or a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">or tagging system because</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">sometimes things do fit in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">and also you want to put it in a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">specific place</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">but if someone searches for a more</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">general thing like if someone&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">for a systems</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:22.319" style="s2">uh diagramming system it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">resource and maybe when you attach</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.319" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">to the systems the syst the um</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">the application knows that it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:32.880" style="s2">the system thinking the application</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">automatically knows it&#39;s closer to these</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.880" end="00:47:34.960" style="s2">things so if they search for that then</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.960" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">the near neighbors um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">something just in general i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">thinking about on how to organize that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">data and of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">airtable&#39;s not designed for that webflow</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">is not designed for that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">um so that would be something</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">interesting to work on that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">a very interesting um problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.599" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">that the way i&#39;ve been working around it</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">for now is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">so within the posts um there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">the different rooms and so i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">have it like</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">sub cap the forms are sub categorized</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">so for example this is like the um</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">update project form and so the product</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">form already has specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">fields like filled out basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">and so when you submit a project you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">can&#39;t like make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">a piece of content accidentally so it</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">obviously reduces the time that a user</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">needs to spend</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">but it also helps the cat organization</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">so if you&#39;re in the project room and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">hit submit</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s automatically going to know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">trying to submit a project and like give</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2">you that form</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">um so i&#39;m kind of hesitant to create</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">a general form but i did want to share</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">one thing with you guys i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to pop up right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">um but this is how i&#39;ve been collecting</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">the information that i&#39;d also like to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">figure out how to scale this to mobile</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">and also like let other people use it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">all right so here is a resource called</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">the d-school reading list so let&#39;s say i</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">wanted to add this to catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">um i have this little web clipper</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:24.079" style="s2">um and i click</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">post and so it pulls the the post title</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.079" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">um i can kind of clean up a bit the url</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll go in and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">kind of grab logo from the page if there</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">is one</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">and if there&#39;s not then i will just</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">screenshot the logo</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.079" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">and then for the cover you can add like</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">page screenshot</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll basically say like okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">this is like a reading list so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">should go</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:58.360" style="s2">in the educational resources</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:50:01.539" style="s2">let&#39;s type main is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.360" end="00:50:01.539" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">i would say resource list and then i can</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">also say like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">um and then the topics so you can select</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">like a main topic</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">and other topics um so for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">this would be like design</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">design thinking and so the buckets would</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">be like who is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">for so like this is for designers</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">um and then you can also put like</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">organization locations which i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">going to put online</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">and then if you wanted to you can add</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">drop downs that weren&#39;t over here so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">can like add a different a new topic a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">new location a new room</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">um and i&#39;m just going to add this to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">design network</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">so i hit add and then that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">on airtable and i could also have it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">from there automatically show up on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">site</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">and then it has the pictures and all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">tags and so that&#39;s how i&#39;ve been like</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">basically doing the categorization</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">right now of everything is through that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">but the only thing is i can&#39;t do that on</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">mobile</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">and i i would like to build maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">like a really quick cheap like mobile</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">app that lets me do that because i have</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">so many tabs</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">phone from facebook from slack that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">like oh i want to save this for later</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">because i don&#39;t really need it now but i</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">want to be able to find it later</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">and so i want like a better bookmark gap</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">where i can share to app</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">and then do that and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">categorize everything with that level of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">like detail</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">um and have it kind of like upload to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">the site automatically get points for it</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">as a contributor to the commons</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">yeah yeah i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">real simple</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">easy to do mobile app to do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s some existing apps where you</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">can you can share to it no just make a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:07.599" style="s2">note of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">url and then later you could do the data</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.599" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">entry</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">but that would be the data entry the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">phone i know that you can take a website</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">and and have it accept shares from other</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">apps on the phone including the browser</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s a web</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">tech to do that but um</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it still would take a fair</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:31.839" style="s2">amount of work</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">to set that up and then would it be</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.839" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">really easy for the user</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">to make it really easy for the user you</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">need to get it into the app stores</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">so um like you could develop an ionic</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">app and stuff like that but it it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;d take a week or so which could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s definitely i just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">how much it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:59.040" style="s2">it would uh it would take technically to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">build something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.040" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">that would honestly speed up my process</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:04.319" style="s2">the most out of anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">and also i think would be valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.319" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">other people even just not</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">with catalyst just to use for their own</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">purposes well and do you think but i</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">mean if you had a tool tour you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">your phone you&#39;re on a website</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">do you really want to do that data entry</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">on your</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">on your phone or do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">want to just save it for later and do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">later the problem with saving it for</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">later is i have like 2 000 tabs</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">and trying to go through them now would</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">take weeks whereas like</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">if i find something and i&#39;m like i</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">already looked through it it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">in my head like what it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">um that process if i streamlined it</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">could take me like 30 seconds that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">be forever catalogued in this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">base that also like</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">you know hopefully thousands of other</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">people can can get</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">use out of um so that tagging i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">the time spent to do that tagging</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">at the time of finding the site just</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">like is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">game theoretically is more valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">do it there and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">for that person and for everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">who&#39;s involved in the network</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">and so i would obviously want people to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">be rewarded for doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">that tagging whether that was like</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.079" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">financially paid like i</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">i have a pool of money that i&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">to like put for the first</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">round of comment sharing basically and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">like anyone who contributes to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">comment would basically get a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">and hopefully if i did find a way to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">um you know patreon subscription or</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">donations</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">then that would go into that pool um so</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of idea behind that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">yeah we got about</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">four minutes left um let me throw an</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">idea out there</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.799" style="s2">now this is once again far future um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:46.920" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.799" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">have you heard of did we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.920" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">murmurations yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:54.000" style="s2">yes i i um i didn&#39;t realize it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">the way that birds moved together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.000" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">so cool yeah i tried</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">that&#39;s all i could find but go on so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">also thinking that you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">thing to where you&#39;re going to a website</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">saying oh here&#39;s the logo</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">and here&#39;s maybe even the descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">text so first of all a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">websites do have that descriptive text</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">the in metadata on the site so</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">but it&#39;d be interesting that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">a collection tool like you just showed</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">uh and then it logged where on the site</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">is getting all the data and then have it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">weekly</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">check every website or however often you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">want to see whether that&#39;s changed</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:31.599" style="s2">so then it would be constantly that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">other thing where we talk about where</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.599" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">things get stale</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">and then giving websites the ability</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">just like in immersions to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">to post that information so we know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">the updates are and we know we can grab</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.760" end="00:55:45.040" style="s2">it automatically</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">but have that be optional because people</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">won&#39;t do it but</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">there are some services out there where</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">you can go to a website highlight some</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">and it&#39;ll check that website and let you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">know what it changes</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">um but you would want to i don&#39;t know of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">any of those that give an api that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">could integrate into your air table</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">toward automatically pull it and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">maybe not automatically pull but pull it</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">so that someone could review it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">because if the website doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that you&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">same text but at least you&#39;ll know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">that text</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">that has changed enough that it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">and someone can take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">and then yeah and i think also if you do</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">get some funds</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">not just have a community where people</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">get it i mean i guess you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">this way too but there&#39;s a lot of va&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">certain countries where it doesn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">that much because of the difference in</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">in currencies uh that you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">have just some trained people that go in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.880" style="s2">and categorize us without too much</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">expense</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.880" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">so all those options i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this makes everything more</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">complex but there&#39;s something about like</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">when you did that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:50.799" style="s2">in your web browser there are parts of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">it that were way too complex for me in</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">part like i would look at that and be</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">like i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no way i&#39;m dead entering that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">but if i was able to go in</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">and let&#39;s say be like oh i can grab</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">and spend you know half an hour just</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">grabbing logos and spend half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:07.119" style="s2">you know what i mean just doing the text</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">i think what bentley&#39;s suggesting is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">more ai approach of like we already have</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">the logo and then it will just keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">updating the logo for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">portion but having that in between where</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">people who are less tech savvy</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">can that i can just tag something say</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">ooh this website looks really cool</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">someone ought to look at this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">be able to do what i can&#39;t do with it</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:25.920" style="s2">and if it&#39;s already repetitive and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">someone&#39;s already tagged that one it</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.920" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t care and if it hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">looked at people know to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">and people know if they have one</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">specific skill set like i&#39;d rather just</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a url i can keep getting logos</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">all day long no problem especially if</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:12.559" style="s2">that we might spend a little time trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">to crack because</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.559" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">everything else we can we can figure if</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">both of those and what&#39;s funny maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:23.440" style="s2">need to talk about again either on one</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">of our friday calls or next saturday is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.440" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve tried to build similar</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">well it has a slight overlap with which</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:31.119" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re doing just knowledge commons</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">for our projects</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.119" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">right um how what&#39;s the best way for us</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:39.839" style="s2">as a group to kind of collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">on all this stuff and not duplicate so</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.839" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that came up for me as</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.160" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">another thing like</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">hey i already made a list of all these</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">yeah the nature of prototypes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:35.599" style="s2">always fun</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">um is there any element of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">deduplication</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:40.480" style="s2">built in like on that web clipper if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">go to submit a site that i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.480" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">submitted</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">does it stop me does it warn me does it</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.200" style="s2">merge them</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">these are sort of things that i i need</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.200" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">help with kind of automating</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">airtable has a built-in hadoop function</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">where you can kind of go in</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">and like it&#39;ll pull up two records that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">match the url or the title and you could</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:00:59.359" style="s2">you could dupe them and you can also set</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">up like filters where like</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.359" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">if a new record is submitted and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">matches an existing url then it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">push to the site</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">um but that stuff just gets so much more</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:10.240" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t really know how to approach</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.240" end="01:01:14.319" style="s2">it yet um because</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.599" style="s2">there&#39;s other issues that i haven&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.319" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">to come up with i think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.599" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">problem to have if people are submitting</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:21.359" style="s2">the same thing and then kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">merging merging them i would assume</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.359" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">would be the best way to kind of go</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">about that and like give both people</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">for for helping on it the the easy way</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">to go about this would be i would say</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">like when you upload a resource</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">you can maybe just have a list of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">the other resources so you can say like</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">hey type in the url like make sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">not here i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">uh not user-friendly enough but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s part of if you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">if like if i went on and i did all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:49.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:51.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m in my little brain that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.760" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">a lot of work more than when you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.920" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">if i knew right away as soon as i</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">went to clip it with the url that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:58.319" style="s2">would or it was had already been done</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">and it was maybe just missing some spots</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">i could fill in those spots</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:03.599" style="s2">but if if i had to do that all and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">find it was already duplicated i would</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.599" end="01:02:08.720" style="s2">never be doing it again</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">is what is is yeah for my my point of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.720" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">like i learned and did all that whereas</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">i would absolutely just copy and paste</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">the url and be like oh somebody did it</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">cool i don&#39;t need to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">yeah and i work in an industry where i</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:21.599" style="s2">help sort of people do</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">did entry and for the most part people</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.599" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">don&#39;t check if it already exists</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">even in tools where it&#39;s super easy and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;ll stop you they still find</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:29.119" style="s2">ways to bypass sit and add duplicate</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.119" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">you know because they&#39;re in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">of something one of the steps in their</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">head isn&#39;t check to see if it already</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just like okay i&#39;ve got this i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">to enter and then move on to the next</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">step</p>
