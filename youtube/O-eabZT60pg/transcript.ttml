<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">the more whole you are the more present</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">you can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">the more grounded you can be the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">you can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">in the kind of extremes of emotionality</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">completely getting hijacked and losing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">it into behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">where later on you really regret stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">and this practice of bioenergetics which</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">is a kind of body movement therapy</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">but the concept is basically just to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">body more open</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">and by that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s derived from originally in the west</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">the work of a guy called wilhelm reich</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">and here this idea of when traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">events happen or when we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">conditioned a lot in childhood not</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">really allowed to just</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">be ourselves in some way that is all</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">held</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">in the body in the muscle system in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">fascia</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">as holding patterns you know areas of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">unnatural tension in the body</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">or dead zones you know kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">areas where the awareness has just</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">dropped out and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">your personality is kind of represented</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">in your body</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">it&#39;s there in your body and whilst</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">like i say at the beginning you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">normally when we want to change our</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">personality or let go of the past</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">we go to our mind and you know we look</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">for therapists and stuff and we look for</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">stuff to do with our mind you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">our thought patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">and our behavior from our mind but</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to go to that place or if</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve been to that place and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">really working</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">for you somewhere you can also just work</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">at a bodily level</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">you can actually just work at a bodily</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">level because</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">i mean what i came across you know about</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">a few years into my therapeutic journey</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">about 20 years ago my realization was</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">i&#39;m just blocked</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">i&#39;m just blocked as basically i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">just completely</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">completely blocked and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">you know actually all i need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">not think about who to be anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">or or how to do this or how to get this</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">girlfriend or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:36.000" style="s2">you know like who do i have to please</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">who do i have to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">i just need to take out the blocks i</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">just need to take out the blocks</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">and and what remains will be will be me</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">you know will be more authentic version</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">of me</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">and you know this is what bioenergetics</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">to me is about it&#39;s got three elements</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">to it you put your body in a posture</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s a slight movement posture</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">or pulsing</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">and then you try and maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">posture and at the same time you breathe</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">through the mouth quite deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to bring energy or</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">or oxygen you know into the body into</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">into the main trunk core of the body</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">builds up a bit of a charge</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">of energy inside you breathe quite deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">and you try to keep your attention on</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">your body just feeling your body</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">and then with different postures and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">practicing this</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">what tends to happen over time is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">sometimes you go through like quite a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">deep emotional process but</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">often you just feel more open it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">this kind of holding patterns come a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">and sometimes people shake or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">then it starts to diffuse and move</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.279" style="s2">and after doing bioenergetics</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s quite common you know what you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.279" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">you feel more grounded</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">you know like you&#39;re more you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">present on the earth</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">but at the same time you&#39;re more open as</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to be open with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">know i realized</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">for the first time in my life i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">need to be in in total control of every</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">you know which was my default</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">unconscious default</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">like as a as a kid growing up from my</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">childhood you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">and so this openness was really really</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">like miraculous to me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">with the groundedness as well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">sense that okay i can be open</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">but if something bad starts happening i</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">can protect my boundaries i can put</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">boundaries up</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">you know energetically and so a big part</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">of bioenergetics is really you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">postures you&#39;re opening up the body</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">and you&#39;re allowing stuff to move</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">without needing to really think about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">so much the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">kind of job that your mind has</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">is just to try and maintain the posture</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">on the edge of your comfort zone</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s really really painful then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">know you need to stop or slacking off in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">some way if it&#39;s physical pain</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">to try and remember to keep breathing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">because often people</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">they do a posture and they focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">posture but they shut their breathing</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">right down they kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">of close at the throat and then to try</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">and remember just to keep your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">on your body</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">you know and if you can the more that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">you can keep those three going</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">stuff opens up another way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">bioenergetics works particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">how i how i use it is is opening kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">centers in the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">like most people are on a on a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">deep psychological level blocked at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">throat</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">you know their throat they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s okay to just</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">be me you know you know it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">like been trained out of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">as a little kid i&#39;m not saying everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s quite common in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">my experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">and also people are kind of blocked they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">can&#39;t feel their belly</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">you know so what happens when we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">feel the kind of natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">somatic centers of the body is but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">mind kind of takes over</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">by that i mean like the prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">cortex up here you know it just says</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">well i&#39;m going to take over this job you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">know i&#39;ll take over keeping you upright</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">when it&#39;s trying to do this you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">just makes the body tense basically so</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">so yeah it kind of does it but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">creates a lot of tension</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s like we&#39;re opening up</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">energy centers</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re freeing up areas that are held</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">basically in the body</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s i guess it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">a way of explaining bioenergetics i just</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">you know because it&#39;s kind of common in</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">the uk at the moment but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">of people talking about embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s okay a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">wrote a book about embodiment recently</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">and runs his conference</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s another guy uh i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">his name was always banging on about</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">embodiment but</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of irony for me but</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not necessarily really working</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.240" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">their body very much</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">you know they&#39;re just writing lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">stuff about embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">and maybe i really is not quite the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">right word but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do in bioenergetics</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">is is bring the awareness out of his</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">thinking mind for a while and let it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">kind of start to reoccupy the body</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">you know to occu instead of having to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">i see in the world you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">people want change and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">stuff out in the world a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">there was this occupy movement you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">people are super pissed off about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">thing in london so they occupying this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">area i think it was in wall street as</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">well or something and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">but what struck me was like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">occupying your body</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t necessarily need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">see the issues in the outside or</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">it can be a kind of default mode of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">to perceive the issue on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">when actually it&#39;s more internal</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s not to say that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">ever protest or</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">or it&#39;s not authentic to protest but</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a default mode of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">brain particularly when you&#39;re young</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">like in your 20s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s like a teflon coating the ego</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">internal stuff is just tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">disowned and we just see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:46.639" style="s2">outside world you know like</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">men are wrong you know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">you know authority is wrong you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">because we had a bad experience of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">authority as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">you know when that that that repressed</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">feeling starts to vibrate a bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">suddenly the world is wrong you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">world is wrong i really need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">just i&#39;m weak i need to get together</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">with like-minded people and oppose it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">functions and uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">the problem is is that if if maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">issue is internal</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">then you&#39;re not really doing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">any favors and you could be empowering</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">yourself by feeling more</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">i did this a lot when i was young you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">know i was a total conspiracy theorist</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">and i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">massively resentful of authority i was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">punk i was a squatter i lived on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">street</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">you know i was a druggie and i just</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">basically assumed that all authority was</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">wrong and needed to be opposed</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">on an ongoing basis you know because</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">that was kind of how i processed my</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">my relationship with my adoptive father</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">you know what happened at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">point for me in my 30s was</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">this teflon coating of my ego kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">faded away a bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">and i started to feel and and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">started to realize</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">whoa what if it&#39;s me what if it&#39;s me you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">know all these things i&#39;ve been fighting</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">what if it&#39;s just what if it&#39;s just me</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">and my childhood you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s when i kind of got involved in</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">anyway since this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">rambling i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve quite uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">quite um introduced enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">but i was thinking maybe we just do some</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">do some body work basically and all</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">you&#39;ll need is some</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:24.839" style="s2">relatively loose clothing i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">to do any of the kind of noisy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.839" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">uh because you might be in an</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">environment where you can&#39;t make a ton</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">of noise</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">but we&#39;re gonna just work our body a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">i think i can just talk our way through</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">it my tripod&#39;s been a bit of a mess and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">i need to just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how to get it so that i can</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">see myself a bit bigger</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">maybe like this maybe not anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">i&#39;m going to turn it around a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">just can you guys see me okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">yeah okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">i can you can hear me okay at this kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">of volume level</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">uh yeah it&#39;s not as great but we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">still hear you okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">okay cool um what we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">so stand up basically stand up because</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">you&#39;re not just going to be watching me</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">and make sure you&#39;ve just got like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">little space around you like a few</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">square meters</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">and then for a moment just take your</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">feet about shoulder width apart</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">and and bend your knees a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not locked through the knees</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">a kind of vehicle like a car</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">that my mind could drive around in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">and i still do at times but</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll sort this bean track out</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">so the first exercise we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">pulse suggest you gently interlink your</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">but just gently pulsing upwards</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">and now we&#39;re going to start to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">through the mouth while we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">fairly deep and really have the</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">aware of any ache</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">breathing through the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">and with again just let it go give your</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">then come into another pulsing movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">put your palms together in prayer</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">position but pointing backwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">with your upper arms vertical and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">just going to pulse like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">pointing back pointing up</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">and again if you wish you can walk</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">around a little or just stay with your</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">knees a little bent standing</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">pointing back pointing up and again</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">breathing through the mouth and feeling</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">your knees are a little bent but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">not locked through the knees</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">and then letting that go with the ding</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">and now we are going to come to standing</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">about with your feet about shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">width apart or a little more</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">so you don&#39;t need to use your arms as</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">levers they just kind of follow but</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">you&#39;re pulling your shoulders forwards</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">like you&#39;re trying to get your shoulders</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">and assuming it is just discomfort and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">basic mental resistance</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">like i&#39;ve just done two reps of this i</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do another rep it&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that kind of mental</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">resistance will come up in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">areas of your life usually often when</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping up or trying to do more</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">of something</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">and so it is actually really useful</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">practice in a broader perspective just</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">to say okay let&#39;s just do a</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve got my resistance i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">it anyway and just breathe my way</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of like a mental</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">holding pattern</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">all right um does that help i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">if it quite answers</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">yeah yeah that that that did help um</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s go to we&#39;ll go to a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">question a moment but uh anja and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">think that would be a good question to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">kick start off the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">q a portion hey there raj</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">well it&#39;s kind of a writing thing in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">sense that you know when you start to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">charge your body with energy by</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">breathing through the mouth in and out</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">you know then you you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">you start to what happens is it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">creates a little bit of friction between</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">the energy that&#39;s stuck in the body you</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">know and this is kind of reiki and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">theory and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">and the fresh energy that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">charging up with and stuff comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">surface and you might feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">tingling you might feel heat you might</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.880" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">feel not so much you might</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">find parts of your body going numb even</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">things that can happen i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a really hard uh proper</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">scientific explanation for it that there</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t really know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">basically a good sign</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">because the body is meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">vibrantly alive in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the whole body should be</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">behind what we&#39;re saying what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re feeling you know the body has</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">neural potential all around it you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">kind of this little bit up here has kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">of taken over control</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">you know like a really bad 1980s style</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">boss</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s just demanding the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">body does what it wants</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">no it&#39;s what&#39;s happened in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">people&#39;s lives so this tingling and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:05.680" style="s2">vibrant aliveness and emotional kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">is like is a good thing if you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">i hope that helps um do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">comment on what the shaking was because</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">i felt that a lot on the bow</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">one um very it was very visceral</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.799" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">yeah i mean the body does does</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">shake i mean i don&#39;t have a neurological</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">kind of explanation for it or something</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">but one of the things you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">particularly in the bow posture is</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">you see as you charge your body with</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">energy maintain the stretch</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:39.040" style="s2">by holding patterns it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a dishcloth you know a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">dishcloth that you find under the sink</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s gone all stiff and hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">you know and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">by putting liquid on it like awareness</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">in a kind of metaphorical sense and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">squeezing it around</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">it starts to be compliant again so by</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">holding it starts to be released</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">basically physically as heat as</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">vibrations whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">so you&#39;re kind of stretching muscles out</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">of their normal</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">zone basically it&#39;s like this but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:09.599" style="s2">taking something that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">held and rigid stretching it more than</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.599" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">you normally would</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">you know and it starts to vibrate and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">release the holding</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">basically especially when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">breathing through the mouth to charge</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">your body with more energy as well</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">motion like is there something about end</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.799" end="01:00:30.319" style="s2">range of motion</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">i mean special yeah it&#39;s just one it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.520" style="s2">set of exercises</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">a lot of them are working around the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.520" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">shoulder area you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">and um one thing you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">if you ever had a feeling of deep grief</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s like the heart</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">on an energetic level opens here you</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">know it&#39;s like something bursting open</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">and in similar manner this energetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">heart you know it closes between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">shoulder blades</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">basically so when you start to work the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">area between the shoulder blades quite a</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">often it does bring feelings a bit to</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">the surface you know emotions</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">that have kind of been held down a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">little bit start to just come up</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">but you know in bioenergetics you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of different postures</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re working all different parts</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">of the body i just</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">did that sequence because i actually did</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">it in a class a week ago and i thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">i&#39;ll do that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">um my second question is</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">like what would you recommend as like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">dose</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">if someone wants to do this like as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">regular practice how might they know</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re doing too much</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.000" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">and how might they know that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">you know well i would say you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got start off slow and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">you know some people like to get really</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">excited about something and charge into</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">it doing tons and then kind of drop it</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">real quick</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t really work with this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:55.839" style="s2">kind of practice so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s good to do something like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.839" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">even 10 minutes if you can commit to 10</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">minutes just to those last two postures</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">bow and arch</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">you know maybe like on a one or two</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">minute ding</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">and just see how that goes and and just</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">just do 10 minutes in the morning if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">can fit that in and just just see how it</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">goes record</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">you know record how you you feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">afterwards or how your day goes</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">you can always check out my channel on</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">youtube for more postures i&#39;ve also got</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">a book and</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">an online course and stuff like this you</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">know but you could just start with like</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:25.520" style="s2">10</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.440" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">10 12 minutes it&#39;s a good length of time</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not really you know what makes the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">difference is when someone can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">get into it for a longer period</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">which usually means that they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">getting some positive benefit</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:39.039" style="s2">and but then they can kind of stick with</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">it at times when it&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.039" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">struggle and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">all right i&#39;m going to read lily&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.039" end="01:02:52.799" style="s2">question uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">where is it why breathing through the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.799" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">mouth</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">i can pay more attention while breathing</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">through the nose is it about letting go</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">of control</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">and i&#39;ll take on a comment from mary as</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">well and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.119" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">mary said curious about choice of open</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">mouth breathing versus yogic</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">mouth closed and then maybe another</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">comment from area</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.799" style="s2">um usually a more quiet person found</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:16.319" style="s2">self-releasing sounds during</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.799" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">exercises curious about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.319" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">yeah i mean often people do yoga too to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:23.839" style="s2">calm down and get peaceful</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">you know so breathing through the nose</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.839" end="01:03:26.799" style="s2">will usually support that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">you know breathing improve the nose and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.799" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">out through the mouth is quite quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">common in yoga but</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:34.559" style="s2">with this technique we&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">you may well feel calm afterwards but in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.559" end="01:03:37.280" style="s2">the practice you&#39;re not really trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">just calm yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">you may find it soothing but breathing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">through the mouth generally</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">kind of creates more raw energy in your</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">body in the in</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">in the core of your body you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">breathing quite deep and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">this creates a charge which works to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">start to help</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">help the release happen so although kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:57.119" style="s2">of you know quite a quite a few of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">postures might look a little bit like</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.119" end="01:04:03.039" style="s2">yoga and may even be the same as yoga</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">the kind of mental attitude and and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.039" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with the breath is a bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit different so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:09.839" style="s2">basically to charge your body with</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.200" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.839" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">as opposed to trying to relax the body</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.559" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">you know you actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">in order to create relaxation in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:18.559" style="s2">kind of way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.039" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">this kind of approach you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.559" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">over stretching or stretching very</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:23.680" style="s2">strongly</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">some of the muscle groups and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.680" end="01:04:26.480" style="s2">through doing that they can release some</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">of that holding that&#39;s sitting there</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.480" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t really get to move when</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">they&#39;re just doing their usual range of</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">and then it starts to come out and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">when you do sit down later you feel wow</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">like i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">now i&#39;m really relaxed so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">kind of theory basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:47.200" style="s2">i&#39;ll read this comment uh for you you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">can use this as a testimonial maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.200" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">uh damn i was so skeptical while we were</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:52.559" style="s2">doing it seemed dumb</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.640" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">but damn i feel so relaxed and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.559" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">tingly right now it seems like i just</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.920" end="01:05:00.799" style="s2">got a two hour massage</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.799" style="s2">you gotta you went over a skeptic um</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">cool thank you sarah uh you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.119" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">okay um have you heard of uh trauma</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:15.839" style="s2">releasing exercises</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">um a i felt an urge to shake even before</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.839" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">you kind of invited that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">and i found that the shaking was a i</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">preferred it it was a lower frequency</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">bigger movement bigger muscles than the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">kind of high</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">that i often get in the theory</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">yeah yeah trauma releasing exercises</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">came out about i don&#39;t know about 20</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">15 20 years ago this guy david picelli</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">and i mean he never says this but as i</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">understand it it&#39;s like a small subset</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:46.079" style="s2">of kind of diverse bioenergetic</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">exercises</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.079" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">that he you know he kind of trademarked</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:53.280" style="s2">it and copyrighted it and created</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">a training for it you know so</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.280" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s pretty cool i mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">bioenergetics is</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:06:00.559" style="s2">is pretty extensive and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">sprawling and not really under control</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.559" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">by any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">governing body if you have tried but</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">they have not</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:09.520" style="s2">really succeeded uh so</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">you know tre is a much more kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.520" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">formal structure you&#39;ve got certain</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">exercises and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">but my experience of tr is mostly based</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.760" end="01:06:18.720" style="s2">on what i would call bioenergetics but</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.720" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not trying to make some</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">uh you know kind of um competitive point</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">you know that kind of thing it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.920" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">know tiara is great</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">bioenergetics is generally worth it can</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">go in a lot of different directions</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">do you have a follow-up sir</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">not really thanks oh i&#39;ll i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:49.680" style="s2">just follow</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:51.039" style="s2">that up so so when i hear all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">what i actually said whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.039" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">bioenergetics whether it&#39;s tre whether</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s osha or whether it&#39;s shaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:58.720" style="s2">but the whole purpose of all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.200" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">is to just move</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.720" end="01:07:02.720" style="s2">energy so and then the body has to find</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:04.720" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.720" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">what actually suits the body it could be</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.720" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">yoga yoga might not be strong enough it</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">might be screaming</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">um so one way or another we&#39;re simply</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">manage energy move is that is that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:18.559" style="s2">case and we have to find out what</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">actually suits us</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.559" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">yeah i mean i guess you know with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">of these kind of practices and</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">different therapies in general you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:27.839" style="s2">when you first start off you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.559" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">like walking around a mountain and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.839" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">trying different paths</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">you know and at some point you have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:34.240" style="s2">kind of choose a path and just keep</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">going with it you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.240" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">that&#39;s how i see it i mean a lot of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:40.960" style="s2">show kind of working</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:42.799" style="s2">dev raj is not sure name you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.960" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">you know yeah was focusing on on</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.799" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">catharsis on the body on feeling the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.880" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">breathing and some very kind of intense</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.880" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">process work that was around in the 70s</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">and 80s which has mostly</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">kind of disappeared now but the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">like the shaking is kind of remaining</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">all right um let&#39;s go to margaret</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.839" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">this is probably our last question</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">hi thank you deb raj um</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:15.039" style="s2">i&#39;m curious oh man sorry i started</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">talking and woke the baby um</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.039" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">why um what you see is the unique</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:23.679" style="s2">offerings of bioenergetics</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">versus other somatic breast practices</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.679" end="01:08:29.440" style="s2">you touched a little bit upon mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">yoga as a tool for relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.440" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">but i guess i&#39;m just when i hear all</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">this it kind of sounds like rebuilding</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:36.960" style="s2">the wheel</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious as to what you see as the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.960" end="01:08:41.920" style="s2">unique offerings of this path as you put</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">it through the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.920" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">well yeah i mean um i would say you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.199" end="01:08:48.960" style="s2">with bioenergetics it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">specifically focused</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.960" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">on removing the kind of bodily effects</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:54.719" style="s2">of trauma or conditioning</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">basically you know there are some</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.719" end="01:08:57.520" style="s2">secondary focuses and different slightly</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.520" end="01:09:02.159" style="s2">but that&#39;s its kind of primary focus and</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:03.759" style="s2">you know you may well get a similar</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.159" end="01:09:05.679" style="s2">effect doing yoga particularly say</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.759" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">ashtanga or something like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.679" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s not actually been created with</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">that intention</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">you know hashtag yoga you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">about developing the asanas and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">developing your body to be a fit vessel</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">for hindu spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">traditionally usually</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">but with bioenergetics it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">specifically created</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:25.279" style="s2">to start to take out some of the blocks</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">as they manifested were accessible at a</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.279" end="01:09:27.679" style="s2">physical level</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.239" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">that was that&#39;s what it specifically</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.679" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">intended for so</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">you know there&#39;s hundreds of other</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">techniques which may resemble it a bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:39.199" style="s2">but they don&#39;t have that specific focus</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of useful in a secondary</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.199" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">way because</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:43.120" style="s2">then people are coming to it with the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.120" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">intention that that is what they want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">do and when you have the intention okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">i want to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve got this trauma from my</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">dad or my mom or</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:55.840" style="s2">this or that writing character type or</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:57.600" style="s2">whatever you have a specific intention</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.840" end="01:09:59.760" style="s2">to move through that</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.600" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">and then that having that level of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.760" end="01:10:03.600" style="s2">intention also supports you</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.760" end="01:10:05.120" style="s2">you know as where like for example when</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.600" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">i started to do therapy and i needed to</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.120" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">do really heavy therapy but i started</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">going to like</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">dance workshops because i thought maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">like five rhythms would get rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:14.880" style="s2">you know or whatever you know and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">i&#39;d meet some women as well or something</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">you know it was like i wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:20.560" style="s2">addressing you know there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">wrong with dance workshops they&#39;re great</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.560" end="01:10:22.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">i was not really addressing but i needed</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:25.280" style="s2">to do actually very deep therapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.280" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">to heal from what had happened when i</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:31.600" style="s2">was a kid you know so</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">there is something about calling it a</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.600" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">therapy and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">and saying this is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">specifically about but it tends to pull</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">in people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">are ready at an ego level to really okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">i really want to start to work on this</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not kind of being</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">wishy-washy with their mind anymore like</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2">i could do a bit of that do a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.280" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2">this you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">interesting i really appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:56.239" style="s2">framing around intention</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">um and conscious intention because i</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">think that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:01.840" style="s2">although available in other uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">thematic-based tools</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">um not necessarily as you said with</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:08.239" style="s2">their primary purpose and creation</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">so that does help frame it in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.239" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">this as a tool for this</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">specific thing or domain</p>
