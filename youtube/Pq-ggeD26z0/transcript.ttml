<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">upon it&#39;s amazing that the universe</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">gives the exact lesson that I need at</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">everybody when you commit to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">completion process you adopt the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">perspective that any current emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">upset is in fact just the echo of a</p>

<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">circumstance in your current life that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">you think is the cause of your upset is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">just a trigger from a prior wound of one</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">that needs your attention because</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">triggers today help you see the wounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">you have tried to suppress the triggers</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">are beneficial instead of detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">you might find it difficult to accept</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">that triggers today are good are a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">thing even when they hurt so badly you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">don&#39;t have to feel grateful for them you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">just have to commit to viewing them as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.460" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">looking at triggers this way you can use</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">them to your advantage you can see each</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">trigger as a wide open opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">integration the beauty of the completion</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">process is that when you use triggers to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">integrate yourself you&#39;ll eventually</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">lose any negative association that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">might have had with the triggers you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">be much less reactive when a trigger</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">does occur and you&#39;ll begin to associate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">triggers of integration and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:07.710" style="s2">better instead of feeling worse once the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">meaning of something changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.710" end="00:02:10.599" style="s2">dramatically your whole life can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:12.939" style="s2">lived</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.599" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">you no longer live in a state of defense</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.939" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">or feeling victimized you&#39;ll feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:20.049" style="s2">the universe is assisting you instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:22.810" style="s2">deliberately causing you to suffer and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.049" end="00:02:26.139" style="s2">that is in essence what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.810" end="00:02:28.329" style="s2">experiencing the last couple years since</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.139" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">being introduced to kylo ceases work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.329" end="00:02:33.459" style="s2">sure and although he doesn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:37.060" style="s2">the completion process per se he talks</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.459" end="00:02:38.590" style="s2">about a GPS map and I like that version</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:42.669" style="s2">we rode like we all have our own roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.590" end="00:02:45.489" style="s2">to become who we are meant to be it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.669" end="00:02:47.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily look sane and right</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.489" end="00:02:50.379" style="s2">to other people because it&#39;s not their</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.950" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">road map it&#39;s yours and every experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.379" end="00:02:56.139" style="s2">you have is the proper experience that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">being said I don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.139" end="00:03:01.959" style="s2">around purposely triggering other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:05.819" style="s2">but in my own personal life I now can</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.959" end="00:03:08.650" style="s2">see that triggers are a blessing but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.819" end="00:03:10.180" style="s2">although I&#39;ve had to de-stress my life</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.650" end="00:03:13.269" style="s2">on a large part and I&#39;ll go into that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.180" end="00:03:14.889" style="s2">and my parallels of teal swans life even</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.269" end="00:03:16.209" style="s2">though hers was highly traumatic in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.889" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">order to be able to come to this process</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.209" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">and instead of mine being highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:27.699" style="s2">traumatic my threshold was much lower so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:29.319" style="s2">it was highly traumatic to have my</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.699" end="00:03:31.269" style="s2">experience in the medical community and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.319" end="00:03:34.689" style="s2">highly traumatic to have my experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.269" end="00:03:36.459" style="s2">as an autistic child not knowing so and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.689" end="00:03:38.889" style="s2">living in this world in a neurodiverse</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.459" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">way and having a much lower threshold on</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.889" end="00:03:45.819" style="s2">things like sensory processing and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">for life-and-death reasons you come to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.819" end="00:03:53.699" style="s2">needing to regain sanity I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:57.099" style="s2">what word to use instead of that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.699" end="00:03:57.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to distress situations in a</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.909" end="00:04:03.579" style="s2">video on stress I&#39;m sure probably many</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:05.259" style="s2">and I am just enjoying reading this book</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.579" end="00:04:07.030" style="s2">and having all of these aha moments</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.259" end="00:04:09.879" style="s2">that&#39;s different than reading something</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.030" end="00:04:11.979" style="s2">else it oh I didn&#39;t think about it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.879" end="00:04:14.650" style="s2">way this is what this is what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.979" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">trying to say not as eloquently not as</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.650" end="00:04:18.789" style="s2">well processed because I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.789" end="00:04:21.940" style="s2">to deal with my present I was dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.530" style="s2">with the triggers as they come up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">what they&#39;re here to teach me</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.530" end="00:04:28.450" style="s2">not going back and healing that and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;ll be interesting just to see that</p>
