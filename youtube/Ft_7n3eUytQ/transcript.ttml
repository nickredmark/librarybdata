<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">our works various work and see what</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.840" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">emerges from that so</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">who would like to go first in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">introducing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll go ahead uh greg enriquez professor</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:49.520" style="s2">of grad psych</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">uh graduate psychology at james madison</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.520" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">university and uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">interested in theoretical uh psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">unifying psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">so that we can guide our way toward uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">wisdom in the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">nice yeah so before we start the call i</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">mentioned that this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">question is like almost intractable for</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">one of the things that i noticed is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">very distinct sense of resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:18.400" style="s2">trying to create a finite set of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">semantics uh particularly anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">attached to this notion of my biography</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:22.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">it almost certainly can&#39;t be the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.960" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">okay almost like if you were gonna i</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">could i could</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">invoke some subset of my biography which</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">is always going to be a projection right</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">some slice through the whole thing right</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">but even that probably isn&#39;t relevant</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">because what i can say for sure is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;m definitely part my my thing is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">in some kind of journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">into the future right and one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">areas of inquiry is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">what is it what is the self that is in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">that journey into the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">and what is that aspect of biography</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">that is not coming along for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">right and i don&#39;t have a good answer to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">that like i don&#39;t know and a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">this is a necessity to not know because</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">otherwise you may be holding on to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:02:00.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not supposed to be coming along</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that that inquiry like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">that that continual process of extending</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">into that journey into the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">and the increasing increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">capacity i hope to be able to be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">elegant</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">in that to be more fully capable of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">making those choices on a momentary</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">i would say is the best way of naming</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">the event that sometimes referred to as</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">me sweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">that was beautiful very good that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">i mean so jordan does what i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">what that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">thought he would do uh he exemplifies he</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just speak and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">i found you exemplifying there jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to call it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">metanoias we&#39;re meaning that you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">that changing of no</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">no noises how you notice but also that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">sense of conversion like religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">conversion</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">um that&#39;s at the core of many of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">wisdom traditions you see it in stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">you see it in taoism very clearly i</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">think you see it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">these diversions of buddhism with which</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">i&#39;m familiar which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">the shifting uh from the function the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">shifting of the function of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">identification off of horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">onto what i might call vertical ontology</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">you&#39;re identifying more with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">ontological functionality</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">of who you are rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">the autobiographical functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">who you are and i think that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">primary um components of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">wisdom uh precisely because and this i</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">think is very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">the way you&#39;ve even situated this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">conversation it is one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">human beings can respond</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">profoundly and possibly adequately um</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">to the perennial problem of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">mortality where mortality doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to die that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">like in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">ivan ilich ivan ellis knew he was going</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">to die the way you know the two plus two</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">equals four</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">but mortality in the sense that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">was really</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">championed by the prank the pragmatists</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">like james and others</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">right that we are always finite</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">vulnerable and in transformation</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">and yet nevertheless that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">that we can exist in an are a purely</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">arbitrary fashion</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">we have to find a place between</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">algorithmic certainty</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">and arbitrary you know an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">license</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">and that and get getting to be mortal in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">that way requires that shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">and and like i said just before we begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">i knew</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">jordan would just something in that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">in that in that moment and he did you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">just exemplified something</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">that i think is central um to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">wisdom practices and i think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">things that i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">is coming into articulation in both</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">senses of the word right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">in the in what we&#39;re in you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">meta crisis the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">the complexity acceleration that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:55.479" style="s2">talk about jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">both a confrontation with and a need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.479" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">reconceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">that mortality amen</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">uh i i i know you were checking out tap</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">cause to stewart kaufman&#39;s uh the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:10.759" style="s2">uh when i was reading his stuff he</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">talked about the unprestatable future</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.759" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">unprestatable and so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">uh connect to the past and this what i</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">call the sea of effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">that has happened and the sea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">possibility that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">ride the edge of and see and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">and i mean where that comes into what i</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">just said was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">that that&#39;s you know to capitalize on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">andy clark&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">phrase you know that&#39;s the wave of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way we&#39;re writing right</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">now and jordan i&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">and so i mean that that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">thing uh maybe we can explore uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">because here&#39;s here&#39;s a possibility i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">throw it out and we&#39;ll see if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">germinates</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">i think it obviously connects directly</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">immediately to a lot of what jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">doing because</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">i just tried to articulate that and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">brad you and i have had discussions</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">about spirituality within psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">in which i think one way we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">that is exactly this that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">confront deeply and come to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">their mortality as something not just in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">terms of their autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">but you know in terms of like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">the stuff you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">absolutely right no i mean it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">obviously the existentialist frankel</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">talks about the will to mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">will to meaning right uh and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">fundamentally how do we align ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">across the levels of levels and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">dimensions of our existence</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">on the time continuum that places</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">um in a juxtaposed uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">situation when i was uh when i built the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">tree of knowledge for the first 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">interesting enough to riff a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">um the the metaphor what i have and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">show you at some point</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">is ride the wave that&#39;s what it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">called uh ride the weight</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">hot excellent awesome check this out so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">you got like um</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">uncertainty and you got relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">with uncertainty right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">basically two or three basic moves like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">one mode is uncertainties out there and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh uncertainty i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">going to pull back right</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">right and in that in that mode one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">them one of the subsidiary responses is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">oh i&#39;m going to reduce the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">right but that&#39;s actually coming from</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">the disposition of pulling back</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">in the context of uncertainty then</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s this other mode which we might</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">call adventure</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">i hope uncertainty is is the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">condition for any kind of adventure</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">so then the next thing is like that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">was feeling the felt sense of being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">polynesian like way back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">and like i remember having a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">conversation with a new friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">about what was the what was the felt</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">being a polynesian getting ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">in the ocean the key</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">insight was this there was this uh we</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">even talked about it john</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">faith there was faith and it was faith</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">in the sense of groundedness right</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">for sure no idea what lay beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">horizon and simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">such a comprehensive connection with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">milieu</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">so integrated with the ocean in all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">its languages</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">that there was just a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">connection of groundedness</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">in the uncertainty that it was in fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">continuous adventure like there was an</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">openness into it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s that that that ride the wave</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">right you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">achieve or accomplish a level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">embodied mastery of being in</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">relationship with the flow of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">reality that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">that allows you to be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">with uncertainty as the unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">infection</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">bingo so it sounds like the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">the two come together then right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">uh and i think the polynesian metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">is wonderful because</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">uh you know that that move to an</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">ontological sense of identity and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">invoking it jordan with the groundedness</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very participatory yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">participatory and perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">um not that the propositional and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">procedural aren&#39;t there they</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">are but there&#39;s the groundedness there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">the alignment</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">and then there&#39;s that it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">there&#39;s that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">garfield talks about the felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">consciousness there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">you know of a trekking right uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">and plato talks about this you get that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">this gets aligned</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">in such a way that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">there there&#39;s that there there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">that and yeah a synergistic rhythm you</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">yeah rhythm that that that embodies you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">as you ride the cusp of the wave as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">especially if we can get it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">harmonized across units you then have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">the collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">i recommend the boys in the boat if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">want a description of it that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">uh narrative of the 1936 crew team</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">um about how crew how certain crew teams</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">can get in such a precise rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">yeah that they become the whole so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t those both like i&#39;m and now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">using like stereoscopic vision aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">fused the way the left and right field</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">are fused into depth perception</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">practice because presumably</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">i mean you&#39;re focused on the client but</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">you have to be like you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">aligned and in tune with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">and you have to be riding the wave</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">because they&#39;re a complex system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">be unfolding in unpredictable ways and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">you know because there&#39;s factors that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">are unknown to them unknown to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">that are you know driving everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s happening there so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">that must be something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">pregnant when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">psychotherapy oh absolutely uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">i mean i say good psychotherapy always</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">starts with rogers and roger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">fundamental task</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">was to essentially empathize with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">core organismic valuing process of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">of the individual&#39;s heart okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">you then you have to get through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">social self and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">conflicts and the you know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">that is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">defense against uncertainty and threat</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">right that causes them to freeze cause</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">them get rageful</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">causes them to flee causes them to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">obsequious uh those are sort of four</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">poles in sort of uh if you go into</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">polyvagal theory you could see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">embodiment of defense</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">okay you have to weave through that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">start the process of honing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">mirroring so the person can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">like hey wait a minute there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">potentially a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">to harmonize with something inside of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">myself my conscious self and the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">and and see that there&#39;s a potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">here for this uncertainty to grow</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">in a positive direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">okay so one of the things that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">noticed i&#39;ve been really curious about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">now for the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">say three or four years is is what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">the primary protocol for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">relationship in so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">we can put this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">context crew</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">the notion of crew maps very closely to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">the notion of tribe which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">our instinct in the context of crew</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">is to shrink the number of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">to a small number that is cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">over some long period of training</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">exactly what i would propose is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">that is going to be an error that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">actually have to learn how to create a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">capacity a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">a protocol for relationality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">enables us to effectively crew</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:08.079" style="s2">on a flowing basis to move and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">enter like what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.079" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">the three of us have have a level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">we are definitely not a crew but if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">can actually achieve this mastery i hate</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">to use the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">learn i should go with hyper instead of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">meta if we can look at a hyper crew</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">we can effectively find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">establish that protocol what you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">said i think is super powerful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">almost like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">you know how in the process of um of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">development we recapitulate the entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">history of evolution from</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">you know biology all the way up right</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is look when i first meet</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">somebody we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">recognize we have to start with zero so</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">we&#39;re going to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">mammal to mammal interaction it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">listen we&#39;re not we haven&#39;t begun the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">of of communication at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">first thing we&#39;re going to have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">just have a primary protocol which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">allowing our bodies to come into a felt</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">okay there&#39;s a there&#39;s a safeness and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">non-defensiveness in this space that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">can actually begin to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">then it begins to build that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s called attachment security because</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">attachment obviously when you were born</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">it&#39;s to what extent does that relational</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">system start harmonizing or not</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">and become secure insecure with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">dance of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">usually mother but whoever the primary</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">caretaker and then secondary caretakers</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">that lays down the phylogenetic to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">ontogenetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">primate core and then you have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">out how to dance with that and what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">tracking at its intuition</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">is what&#39;s called relational value that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">am i known and valued here at my core</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">or i have to fake it do i have to hide</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">it what the hell am i</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">okay and so then you if you mirror with</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">them and you track and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">intuiting</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">hey is this guy trust me is he real of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">interest is he just going through a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2"> protocol</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just sort of checking</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">boxes so he covers his ass i mean these</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">are all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">subtle tests uh that are happening when</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:49.279" style="s2">somebody say comes into the office</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">and and is looking for something they</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.639" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering then if that if this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">it sounds like this plugs into something</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">that you and i uh greg have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">about which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">and then jordan you and i and chris and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">i have been trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">and uh what&#39;s the guy who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">philosophical companionship talks about</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">the problem with um uh therapy</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">is is it is focused on a particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">right and and that and of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">therapy so this is in no way a criticism</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">of therapy</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">but what we&#39;ve talked about greg is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">idea about</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">can we find a way to exact the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">uh um from things like psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">out into an existential arena</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">completely i i&#39;m actually i&#39;m seriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">considering</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">uh you know whether i&#39;m going to retain</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">my license okay i&#39;m going through a bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">of a professional crisis</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">okay because um as my vision of what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">world needs is</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">what needs to happen i went from oh my</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">god look at all these beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">psycho technologies right right and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">they&#39;re beautiful psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">that are now cloistered in professional</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">offices</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">okay right and then behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">and then i&#39;m at the systemic level i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">started wonder more and more over the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">last 10 years like so what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">you have your shitty relationships out</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">here and i don&#39;t you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">right and then you go in and we create</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">this cultivated perfect cloistered</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">relationship where i mirror you as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">professional</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">right and then you get this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">known felt of existence then you go back</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">out into the real world</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">all right and especially it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">uncommon then all of a sudden actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">you&#39;re my best person who i want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">to you&#39;re the person i want to connect</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">because actually you mirror me and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">whole thing is actually gratifying my</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">needs in a particular way well uh hello</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">this is not what it should be if this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">the core of relation</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">why isn&#39;t that distributed across</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">families and communities</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">across companies or wherever why why are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">we actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">so actually i&#39;ve been very i&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">shift in terms of my own</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">framing about what and of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">psychotherapy um but i</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">am not certain that it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">start to create a negative externality</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">in the way in which we start to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">about relationships and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">and these are things that i have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">distribute into uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">into what i would call the metaculture</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">or you know the culture into</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">this is the uh this is the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">for the civilian you know i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">so this i think there&#39;s a formal way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">actually describing this domain um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">called the commons</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">and so the recognition say look guys</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">there&#39;s actually three fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">domains and we&#39;ve eliminated one of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been trying to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">reality with just two</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">um you&#39;ve got the the formal domain of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">of the state</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">informal relationships organized</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">according to some kind of objective</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">sense you&#39;ve got the formal domain of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">you know the relationship of therapists</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the commons right which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">actually more fundamental it is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">basis of the other two</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">eliminated the commons almost entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">and moved into one of those two</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">and what you&#39;re pointing out is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2"> hell like this concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">therapist is actually just called friend</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">in in in the simplest version right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:10.799" style="s2">by the way parent is the subsidiary of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">friend right it&#39;s just a different yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">if we go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">aristotle&#39;s version of what friendship</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">is absolutely worse that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">exactly right so returning that finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">a way and by the way i think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">the answer to the point of the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">like the meaning crisis is nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">or less</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">than that i think that&#39;s right and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">that just drives what i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">next because</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">the place in which we try to practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">the commons and i&#39;m going to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">another term</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">um because i think friendship uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the aristocrine sense too</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to use a term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">somewhat archaic um but</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s good fellowship we used to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">fellowship with people and the place</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">where we practice fellowship and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">comes from my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">thinking was in was in a religious</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">context one of the things that religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">was what do we hold in common what do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">what do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">right um and then of course the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">problem that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">it arises as a tension within religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s basically a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">instance is the teravadin</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">mahayana split right well no the way you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">do this is you actually retreat into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">monastery</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s cloistered if you use your</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">term greg no mahayana says no no</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">we we don&#39;t we need it so that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">right everybody can get access to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">we need yes we can have people in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">monastery</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">but we need we need that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">where that&#39;s not where it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">that what that does is that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">let&#39;s treat that like a lab</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">where we&#39;ll test out stuff and one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">the primary design features of that lab</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">is it has to be to use paul van der</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">kley&#39;s phrase it has to be scalable</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">it has to be scalable okay and if not</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">supporting that monastery anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">sorry so i propose to you that yes i</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">think it lines up with the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">crisis because as we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">religion and as we&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">relationship between the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">and the school the university we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">fellowship and we&#39;ve lost the lab for uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">improving it and we&#39;ve lost though that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">the way in which that&#39;s supposed to then</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">into the comments brilliant brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">and that goes right with black science</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">notion right of course that at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">foundational level what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">do here</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">is create the proper education in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">time between worlds and we have to tr</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">re-translate right and the other word</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">that came to mind in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">cultivating the commons in the religious</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">context or in the in our west</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">is agape right it&#39;s like how do we hold</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">and for me relational value is the term</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">that i use is being known and valued by</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">important others and and really it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">we&#39;re going to network the commons</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">um in a healthy way it is fostering</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">mutual relational value</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">well i think that picks up on tulip&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">definition of agape right</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">agape is the creative love that creates</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">persons within</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">a community of person and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">the so we&#39;ve lost we&#39;ve lost the notion</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">i think i think and these two get lost</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">together i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">um we&#39;ve lost the notion of personhood</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">and we and we&#39;ve noticed we started with</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">that because that&#39;s what jordan was</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">exemplifying a different notion of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">personhood</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">remember or a vertical we&#39;ve lost these</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">two notions in a correlated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the notion of personhood as</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">something that we all</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">have to do together adoptically and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">therefore we&#39;ve lost also the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">corresponding notion of fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">right so our culture we have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">reduced to citizens of the state</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">and consumers of the market we are not</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">participant persons</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">within the culture anymore right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">great because the tree of knowledge what</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">what it identifies then matter life mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">and then it identifies well what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">nodes of operation in each and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">basically an atom a cell an animal and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">person okay so the culture person and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s our self-conscious justification</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">in a noted network of justification</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">systems that embodied in a set of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">okay so the fundamental thing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">actually how do we network the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">we regulate it off to the goddamn state</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">then mechanically oriented economically</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">and then we we got it uh religiously</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">boom the commons is is becomes shallow</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">empty and broken</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">so that means we&#39;ve sort of articulated</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">two problems then</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">one one way and you can see it in</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">directions</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">one is uh how do we and i&#39;m using this</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">very deliberately how do we exact what</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">from psychotherapy and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">exact what we can remember from our</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">religious history</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">such that we can get what is needed now</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">to get back what jordan is calling</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">the comments and i&#39;ve tried to give a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">little bit of grammar to that notion</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">as the place in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">personhood</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">and fellowship are being are the central</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">things being cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">my mind was turning to history</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">to the actual the actual specific</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">history that gave rise to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">okay how did this thing come to pass and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">then what does that tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">how we might then proceed into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">future excellent and i was also</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.679" style="s2">integrating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">um the the exterior we might call it the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.679" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">socio-technical or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">objective sociological mode right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">which i&#39;m doing the interior</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">psychological</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s we could do the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re looking at um many of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">the biggest problems that we are facing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">today at the level of the objective</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">has to do with the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">trying to solve commons problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">using markets and states yes well</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">really excellent that&#39;s a very yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">start that thing yeah put a pin in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">just say that again double click that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">that is really good that is really good</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">and i should uh mention by the way um</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">i i&#39;ll actually want to i may have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">actually literally take off and search</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">for it because i</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">had a conversation maybe a week ago with</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">a woman in australia who is like going</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">to be my primary mentor in this because</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">this has been her life&#39;s work is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s michelle ballins</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">and the pdp people who&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">on the commons question for quite some</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">time so there&#39;s a whole crew here</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">right right right just kind of reference</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">that crew</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">in a big way but um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">it&#39;s funny i i imagine i&#39;m almost sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">that if we actually spent the time to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">look at it historically there is a like</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">a one-for-one correlation you guys know</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">about the the enclosure movement in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">england</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">no i don&#39;t all right so i know vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">about it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">in the transition of the time period the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">the john you talk about in the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">crisis of that 15 to 1600s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">where a lot of stuff was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">terms of mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">at exactly that moment of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">capitalism was showing up right</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">and one of the like first moves in</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">capitalism is they had to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">enclosure they had to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">property land out of the commons that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">was being managed by</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">a medieval commoning institutional</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">into private ownership which could then</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">be made available</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">into the into the into the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">of capitalism as it was beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">evolve</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">right right right so you know that move</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">happened or that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">we have a nice historical track of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">and played a huge role particularly</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">because it was england it was the place</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">where it first happened because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">english like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">pop this is what we have to do so</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">there&#39;s like a rendering available to an</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">institutional structure that had certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">kinds of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">i would imagine probably locally optimal</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.279" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">capacities right</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">rarely are these things entirely</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">malevolent they&#39;re usually just</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">short-sighted</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">um and there&#39;s a double coordination</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">like we can let&#39;s just kind of do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">historical moment right</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">my wife and i were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">education and i said look let&#39;s put that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">into historical context</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">you have the movement of the mass</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">movement of population</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">in the period of the 1800s from the farm</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">into the city and in particular from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">farm into the factory</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">and contaminants with that in the latter</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">part of it you also had this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">eight-year-olds working in factories is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">oh but wait we can we will we want the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">parents to still be working in factories</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">so now we have to actually have a place</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">to put the kids right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">the beginning of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">educational institutions as daycare was</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">a secondary effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">the emergence of the idea we should</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">teach not put kids in factories</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">but no solution to the problem how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">deal with the fact that we still want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">put their parents in factories</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll put them in schools right so</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">different models of education lived in</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">the prussians who are a very unique</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">character in this story right</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s like oh we gotta cop with</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">the prussians william james actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">talks about this problem uh in in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">this conversation the continental</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">um germanic philosophy was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">rising up as being the big thing because</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">the prussians were winning</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">pretty well right that&#39;s right the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">prussians the persians had formally and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">adopted a hyper control structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">way they did education</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">they they were the model of we want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">highly regular highly controllable um</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">entire populace the way this thing works</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">is everything has to be a rigorously</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">controlled hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">and everybody is a highly trained</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">soldier effectively</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">and and soldier in the narrow sense like</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">not warrior soldier like frederick the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">great&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">clockwork army like playing a cog in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">bigger machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">and the thing is that particular</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">approach this is the reciprocal closing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">piece that moves</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">john you know i&#39;ve talked about where</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">there&#39;s like why do people get into</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">reciprocal closing well the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">it works in the first couple of moves i</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">get this ability to extract</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">energy in the short term which gives me</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">a local advantage i can create this war</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">machine i create the society which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">hyper coordinated around</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">controllable structures actually maps to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">this notion of uncertainty and control</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">coming from the same psychology right in</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">fact i have to protect myself i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">actually create a defense mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">works in the immediate term the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">is everybody else in western</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">civilization got infected by it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">particularly in the us like at exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">the moment when the us was becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">it could be coordinated across that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">territory and and and the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">industrialization was beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">raise a bigger problem okay what do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">do with all these kids and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">we&#39;re now going to create adopt emulate</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">the germanic model</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">of formal education and boom america has</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">that structure right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">and so so let&#39;s move this up to the top</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">remember the meta piece here is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">forcing everything out of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">out of the family out of real</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">relationality</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">out of people deliberating on things in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">some different model</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">into one of these two modes right the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">market and the state right</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">and we can kind of track i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">it&#39;s useful we can certainly do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">product do the process</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">of tracking any given element of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">interior and the exterior over the past</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">250 years or so of that movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">and that will then let us tell us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">about where we are now we can see how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">got here and you&#39;ll tell us a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">right and then the next question of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">course is where do we go right</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">right well that reminds me you know i</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">work a bit with</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">lenny rachel anderson her work on</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">metamodernity</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">okay emphasizes the nordic secret um</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">which was the educational structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">that the nordic countries started to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">know which was basically character</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">okay so they shifted and they basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">took personal</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">and communitized kind of development</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">emphases</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">and that took them from a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">difficult condition</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">uh over a hundred years to a flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">uh society at least relatively speaking</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">so the philosophy of education that bill</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">dong</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a term for it that emphasizes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">bit more personal development a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">uh a bit more community um and commons</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">would have that commons flavor</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">um so that is part of to me then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">ideas about what</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">what kind of educational process and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">what kind of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">is appropriate you know for us in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">current age</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">uh given the completely new landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">problems and possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">that we are facing so yeah i&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">with that argument too greg</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">thomas bjorkman makes that argument yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">i mean they make it together you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re co-authors so so</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s interesting to try and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">pair so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.039" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">like when the enclosure movement is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">happening you get the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">la right and then you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got the english symbol</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">you get the rise of individualism which</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">really goes well</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">uh with both uh in the enclosure</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">movement and with kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">automatization of the individual that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">uh really really uh works with so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">then when you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">depression and frederick degrade who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">philosopher it&#39;s kant and with font</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">but what you have is the latent function</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">the latent functionality is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">right all that calming stuff all that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">persons</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">and community stuff doesn&#39;t go away but</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">so a concrete example is the bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">has the manifest function</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">right of making everything ordered but</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">it has the latent</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">function of diffusing responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">shifting blame</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">so that people cease to be listen please</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">they cease to be persons within</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">community and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">kafka gets that and he holds it up in</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">art and he says</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">and again and again and this like we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">could loop back to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">about therapy like that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">and appreciation of i think jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">point that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">all of that if you&#39;ll allow me a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">somewhat obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:05.839" style="s2">metaphor now if all of that software</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">work that i&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.839" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">uh depends on a significant hardware</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">change that jordan is trying to talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">about with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">with the civilian project that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">truth in marx that if you don&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">you know you know the socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">habitats of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">you can only get so far right i was i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">been impressed by how</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">all of these traditions like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">retreat to the garden the stoics have</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">the porch</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">right and the plateness have the academy</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">which is the grove</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">like what they do is they try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">re-situate human beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">into environmental cultural</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">environmental contexts that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">are conducive uh to our you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">our evolutionary history the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">we&#39;re primarily hunter-gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">right that do that but nevertheless try</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">to put on top of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">this this project that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">about um so</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">i think that uh i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">i think well i i&#39;m trying to i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">book from jordan</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">the the the how everything we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">has to be has to be coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">and again i&#39;m doing this with the hands</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know what this looks</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">but the software and the hardware have</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">to be coordinated so they&#39;re mutually</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">affording in some way</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">yeah well there&#39;s a lot here agreed</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">like super profoundly completely i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">of it actually is in some sense more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">an opportunity than a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">because what it does is it allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">like if you run into a problem it feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">very intractable in the domain of say</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">um heuristic switch to the objective</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">domain and perhaps you actually if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">if you make a shift over there it</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">actually completely prunes a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">of problems that you&#39;re facing in in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">psychological domain and maybe vice</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">versa there&#39;s actually a way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">synergy value from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">uh the woman&#39;s name from australia by</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">the way is kylie kylie stegman</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">oh thank you i&#39;ve only just begun to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">have conversations with her but</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">her focus as far as i can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">actually on the question of the object</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">like how do we do things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">rainforests and uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">um the atmosphere that said</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">i haven&#39;t spent enough time so she may</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:14.240" style="s2">actually have a lot of insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">into the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.240" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">the interest objective as well um</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">oh crap oh okay so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">that i saw as you were talking john</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">was i was remembering the common</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">commentation about the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a right relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">monastery and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">the community yeah right and and i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">there&#39;s actually two roles there maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">one that was kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">a little bit a little bit more secret</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">which is the relationship between the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">the appendix and the and the gut biome</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">brett weinstein points this out he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">like hey guys the appendix isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">actually not</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not uh obsolete what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">vestigial it&#39;s not vestigial</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a place that holds is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">so fully disconnected from the gut</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">that the gut biome can be highly</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">destroyed by lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">environmental factors and yet a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">of a full gut violence stored in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">appendix</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">and so what happens is it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">source of regrowth so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">the monastery actually plays two roles</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">on the one place</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">it&#39;s cloistering enables it to survive</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">and hold</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">to some level the seed corn the seed</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">bank</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">culture codes and also innovate on them</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">so that as the larger culture like</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">uh the ecosystem begins to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">degrade there&#39;s a way to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">back into the monastery and say geez we</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">need to bring come back out of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">monastery</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t have done that appendectomy</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.400" style="s2">we should have let that thing there so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">we can recalibrate we can recalibrate</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.400" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s awesome so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">there too because there&#39;s something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">the reactivation of the monastery and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">the opening of the gates</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">and the returning of the monks back into</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">community to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">to bring these culture codes back into</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">but the problem you&#39;re naming is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">know that is it man and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">aligns greg also with the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve been having around the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">what&#39;s this transformational threshold</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">which is just basically the last move of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">culture space</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">exactly right so so right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">if we now situate ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">landscape afforded by the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">you then sit yourself so culture has</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">evolved into a particular point the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">culture-person plane</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">this is the behavior of persons mediated</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">by systems of justification that then</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">legitimize</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">informational control both of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">actions and of the material environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">situated in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">um on the ecology of the earth okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">and but what the material culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">was different okay separate a tool</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">although an extension of mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">is not feeding back on our systems of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">justification in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">that changes when we start writing so</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">the first techno that really starts to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">fundamentally change the way we justify</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">in terms of because it creates this</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">external memory okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">and then the civilizations you know in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">writing and then all that stuff starts</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">to get networked together in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">industrial code</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">and the modernist industrial code then</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">now is trying to regulate the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">and create institutional codes</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">that actually are alienating it for us</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">from the commons okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">but from the particular angle that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">tree of knowledge affords is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">pay attention to the information</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">processing within systems and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">communication between systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">because those are the planes of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">existence that then result in</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">potentially qualitative shifts</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2"> okay check this out man all right</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">the metaphor that i use a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">really helps me is the movement from</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">complex chemistry into neurons right</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">the point of that movement is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">neurons have a very high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">fidelity and precision right given</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">an input the output is always the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">and lots of noise gets filtered out okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">transpose that into the level of culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">right every move</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">at the level of interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">relationship that shows up as</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">noise is the thing that actually has to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">be eliminated from our relationships</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">so particularly every move that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">intentional noise i.e</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">being a dick like in all the different</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">forms right right the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2"> and manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">right one level right and whether and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">no sorry well there it is here we go</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">we&#39;re back in community</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">we&#39;re back in the conference yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">the way it should be right it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">our lack of haircuts and our lack of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">formal clothes is actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">powerful reminder</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">of the force returned to the comments i</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">will go ahead and shift this to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">jive here</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">but yeah go ahead um</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">yeah so the move that move at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">culture space at least one</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">fundamental like probably a third is</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">the mastery at all nodes of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">techniques of a showing up authentically</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">and b noticing when noise is being</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">injected</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">into the relationship and rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">exiting that out of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">absolutely this is that&#39;s great so this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">is certain terms of the own</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">psychotechnologies that are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">this unified theory of knowledge that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">okay um is how do you track what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">called the gi</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">dynamics i just this is in the chapter i</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">did for uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">john&#39;s book gi dynamics refer to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">okay so this is the frame of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">language systems our investments what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">the vector of our the direction of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:19.520" style="s2">okay and the influence which is how are</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">we bouncing off of other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.520" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">and our gi dynamics in harmony or not</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">so when we&#39;re jiving gi dynamics are in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">harmony we have shared justification</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">we have shared intentionality our</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">investment systems are intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">then boom something happens you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">kicked out okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">or you realize somebody&#39;s got different</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">divergent paths somebody&#39;s going to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">hurt</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">then you drop into your defense now</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to protect yourself you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">going to justify defensively you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">going to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">you&#39;re either going to get fearful</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">aggressive etc okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s now all of a sudden you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:48.720" style="s2">bumped and now all of a sudden there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:49.920" style="s2">totally different harmony this happens</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.720" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">all the time right</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.920" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">you know all of a sudden somebody makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">an accusation somebody slips up somebody</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">does certain things now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:59.839" style="s2">here okay so now that when that happens</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the defensive</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.839" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">place where and defense starts</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">to occur</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">right then everybody&#39;s going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">return to equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try to get my justified</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">state of blame so my relational value is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">secure</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m a good person and you can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">me on trial and accuse me and cost me</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">that&#39;s where people go and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">pull in your defense attorney lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">press secretary and you start</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">of hey i&#39;m going to do this okay now</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">active manipulators</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">do this systematically right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">trying to then gain social influence</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:30.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t give a about relational</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">value but they&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.720" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">manipulate the structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">so the outside consequences they get</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">more influence in the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">all right so both of those are very very</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">dangerous all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">so you have to commit to a value</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">structure for me be that which enhances</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">dignity</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">and well-being with integrity those are</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">my big three meta values</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">which which orient then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">transcendence again say this again</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">dignity okay so this is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">respect and it actually goes to an</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">ultimate aesthetic value uh and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">realistically is the value of value in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">okay each person has dignity it also</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">justifies human rights in the universal</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">declaration of human rights</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">okay well-being is happiness with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">worthiness to be happy to quote</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">kant okay and it refers to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">fundamental orientation of your</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">your health and functioning in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">environment to foster potential growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">okay and then integrity is honesty honor</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">and soundness</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">all right so those are the and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">often they content there&#39;s tensions</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">between those</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">all right so i try to align my being</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">with those big three</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what and that&#39;s what i i invite</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">everybody when i</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">when i think about you know what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">person a good faith okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s somebody that has some form of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">universal value structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">that is committed to them above their</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">ego right</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a love or or some sort of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">of notion</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">some ultimate concern that says hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">more important than me</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to orient myself to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">so what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">is if i understand this you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">to circle back a bit you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">about a normativity on the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:45:59.599" style="s2">dimension</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">exactly we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.599" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">normativity by which people can</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">uh understand um</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">and get in get into right relationships</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">all of these different levels of who and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">what they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">exactly let&#39;s see oriented towards the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">ultimate concern or transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">you know you know right it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">ultimate uh end</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">for an aristotle aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">perspective right it&#39;s sort of what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">what is it there that is good uh that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">transcends</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">infinity i mean you know that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">the orienting point</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">okay so then yeah go i was just going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">uh that that affords a question now</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">comes to my mind then</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">i think we&#39;re on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">articulating a question at least i find</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">an important question to ask because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">has both theoretical and practical input</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">how do i distinguish the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">manipulators</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">from the people how do i distinguish uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">how do i distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">from emerging beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about justification</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">systems right the thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">look the noise is not an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">feature</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.880" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">right noise is relative to what you find</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">relevant right signal noise differences</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">and so if i like if i&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">justification system</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">then xyz are going to count as noise but</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">if i move to this justification system</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">xyz now may be central this is the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">cuny and the anomalies become the center</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">of the new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">right you and i were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">something like this yesterday so</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">how do i distinguish people</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">who are not playing the game fairly</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re manipulators</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">from people who say no no i want to i</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">want to play an infinite game here</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">rather than a finite game and i want i</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">want to get i i</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">right yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">we&#39;re with you yeah right there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">first off we know that there can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">complicated code for this because as</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">soon as somebody has a simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">complicated code they&#39;ll just use it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2"> you right</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">so it is that you have to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.800" style="s2">participatory jazz rift</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">regulatory structure to see them in</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.800" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">context feel where their motive is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">um but they from my vantage point they</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">should be committed</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">to some sort of metacultural value</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">structure in other words there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">some notion about what good</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">is okay and then i have an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">pluralistic frame for that so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">know what is your ultimate concern your</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">ultimate purpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">right so that&#39;s and at some level then</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">by i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">finish the thought in terms of for</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">people of good faith the whole commemo</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">the little black dot</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">repre on the tree back there represents</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">what&#39;s called comm mo</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">and that is for individuals of good</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">faith you jump into a metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">observer&#39;s stance so we step outside</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">say wait a minute what the hell just</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">happened if somebody get defensive and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2"> based on ego concerns</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">okay then if so that&#39;s okay we get</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">curious accepting</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">loving and motivated toward valued</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">states of being to get back on</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">a healthy gi dynamic track okay so</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a psycho technology that says well</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">wait a minute if we start to get bumped</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">because we don&#39;t get each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">we start bullshitting because we see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">other as threat</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">okay if we are people of good will we</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">should be able to step outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">apply the principles of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">acceptance loving compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">motivated toward valued states of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">and then re-establish at least where the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">hell we are in relation</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">let me throw in i think i think i can</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">handle i think let me just throw in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">pieces coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">okay and i think i thought if i frame it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">in the context of parenting i think it</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">actually gets a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">okay um because what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">basically is boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">so this is the uh the inverse side right</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">of at least with what uh greg&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">um so i&#39;m going to measure it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">of my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">and by my i mean whatever the we is</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">right our our interest objective</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:45.880" style="s2">to hold the other right</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">okay now if the other is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.880" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">hyper-sophisticated sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to define it as my</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">capacity to hold the other is inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s it my ability to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">relationship with you just is enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to work</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">i cannot find a way to get around that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">now you&#39;re still asking the question how</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">do i</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the signal that lets me know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s really happening but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">step it back for a second before we get</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">there because the higher issue is okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">there will definitely be circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">in the immediate term</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">all over the place and in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">still irreducibly probably for</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">a very long period of time maybe forever</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">where our collective capacity to hold</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">the other is inadequate to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">relationality</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">yes therefore we then need to have me</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">have boundaries right boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">emerge in that environment and hold</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">the relationship at a level that it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">be held appropriate exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">um okay that&#39;s that and which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">this actually shows up as like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">nordic version of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">jail it&#39;s like look you know you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">this bad habit you tend to kill people</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">willy-nilly</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">we have not yet figured out how to move</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">you out of that bad habit so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">to move you into a context where</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">the right relationship can be held and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">that&#39;s actually called a place that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">walls that you can&#39;t get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">yep right but there&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">vibe there right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">the vibe is very much one of this is on</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">a continuity of relationship and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">entirely has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">this we&#39;re both we&#39;re both part part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">this game right yep i can&#39;t hold you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t hold me there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">going on here and it&#39;s a weed it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">problem we&#39;re just trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">how to get into a place where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">relationality has</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">can actually have continuity completely</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a whole system of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">dimensions called the 5c dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">which layers where you are</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">in intimacy all the way from ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">connection which means you&#39;re fused</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">all the way down into conflicted and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">controlling which means you&#39;re literally</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">in conflict trying to control the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">person so there&#39;s a whole dimension so</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">the next thing i&#39;m going to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">is crude right and i don&#39;t like its</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">crudity but there&#39;s something also</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">i think probably fundamental so perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">throwing it out there</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">which is and sometimes going back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">this notion of like the protocol is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">built as a layer of stacks</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">and so so my short answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">question is i know</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">i know like i&#39;m an interaction with an</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">experience if i just listen to the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">my body is responding to the experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">if i just listen very closely i know i</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">know whether i&#39;m about to experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">something of tremendous joy and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">there&#39;s actually struggle going on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">noise is noise in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">shared intent</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">or a transcendent effort to create</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">and when the noise is actually having to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:12.800" style="s2">do with something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">deep levels of manipulation um but</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.800" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">i can&#39;t say that my knowing is super</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">high fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">right i can&#39;t actually guarantee that i</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">know for sure and i definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">have a level of skillfulness in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">knowing my sense my sense to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">articulate and express it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">well clearly and i definitely definitely</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t have a skillfulness of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">relationality to manifest that in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">context that can actually bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">the right place right</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about that stack</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">right the reality of going back to our</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">evolutionary history and saying look</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">something about the you know mammalian</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">like uh or the social animal aspect like</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">some somewhere in that stack there was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">huge effort to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">actually have extremely high fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.800" style="s2">sensitivity to this particular move</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re making a move in that domain</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.800" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">and you know the space between my belly</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">button my scrotum is right now telling</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">me that there&#39;s something off in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">relationship yep we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">slow the down i don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s maybe part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:10.880" style="s2">answer well right and actually what</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">go ahead yeah this is all good guys</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.880" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a okay and then i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i want to resonate with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:21.520" style="s2">what both of you just said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">something in both of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">but let me put what i i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">there&#39;s one tail end of the curve that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">you were talking about but i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">actually more</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">i was concentrating on the other end um</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">what i meant by this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">uh let me try it like this um let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">we do have i&#39;ll pick up on both what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">said greg and what you said but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">that we have like we have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">ultimate concerns in terms of personhood</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">and what it is to be a person and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">human being right and and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">values that you articulated</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">great they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">transcendental in a contin sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">they&#39;re constitutive they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">necessary they&#39;re right conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">for for personhood flourishing i get</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">that right</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">and then and then jordan says and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">have this we have this</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">instinctive machinery when the stock is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">in place</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">because we we&#39;ve co-evolved with con</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">specifics</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">across so many species that we there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">however let me still problematize this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">because i think we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">want to something here right right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">just i&#39;m trying to be a good soccer</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">right but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">all of that machinery is based on</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">either instinctive or enculturated</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">notions of what a person is and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">some of the great</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">people did is they</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">and this is what nietzsche was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">get up with trans valuation they</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">altered the notion of what a human</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">person is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">so if if i save you no no i&#39;m ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">committed to xyz value</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing is it&#39;s locked into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">particular conception</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">of human personhood and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">suggesting to you and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">jordan&#39;s very first move in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">dialogue is what is in transition now is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">exactly that fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is be a person i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:18.000" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:19.200" style="s2">please i&#39;m not saying we ignore all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.000" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">our rich history</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.200" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">all of the philosophy all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">religion i was psychology i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m i&#39;m also what i&#39;m saying is we</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">let that go forward in an inertial</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">fashion i think what is in question</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">right now and therefore and therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">puts into question all of those values</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">which is not the same thing as saying i</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">reject those values but it puts into</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">quite what does dignity mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">when my fund like what jesus of nazareth</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">does is change</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">what it means to be a person so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">some of the older</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:53.040" style="s2">notions right are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">transformed and there&#39;s huge resistance</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">because the people the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">time say you&#39;re violating the law</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">the law is what protects our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">and then but jesus and saint paul says</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">no no but</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to change your notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s you know you know human beings</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t made for the sabbath the sabbath</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">is made for human beings right</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to change what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">be a human being to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">and that means new virtues and new</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:23.359" style="s2">values like the greeks don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">faith hope and love they have justice</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.359" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">right and swap for son and wisdom and</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:29.839" style="s2">we don&#39;t throw those out but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">christians give us new ones you see the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.839" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">problem i&#39;m trying to articulate oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">so how do i distinguish somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:39.040" style="s2">trying to launch us into what i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">need right now which is trans valuation</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.040" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">if they&#39;ll allow me the nietzschean term</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">from somebody who&#39;s doing what greg is</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">the person who&#39;s manipulating now i</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">agree jordan that it</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">whatever we&#39;re proposing it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">plug into that evolutionary machinery</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">but if oh</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">it has to be educated it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">educated in some way</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">all right so yeah i know that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">actually have a bunch of uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean this in anything but</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">actually uh fellowship and love we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:06.640" style="s2">a bunch of christian lurkers that will</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">sometimes comment on our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.640" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">yeah and i just heard the voice in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">head what you&#39;re asking is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">distinguish between christ and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.839" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">antichrist yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">yes yes the antichrist is defined i</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">believe as</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">perfectly simulating right it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">actually be more salient</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">the antichrist shows up as the super</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">salient christ right</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">so everything that you would use to try</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">to discern christ hood the antichrist</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">will show up as being even more so</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:32.079" style="s2">right yes so it&#39;s a hyper problem like</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the problem you&#39;re stating it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.079" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">mostly transparent yeah does that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">resonate with you john yeah yes it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">and then you can pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:38.799" style="s2">christian medical what christ does i</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:41.599" style="s2">mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">rene gerard&#39;s notion right christ right</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.599" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">is within a particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">justification framework right and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">he dies</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">he dies within it and he breaks and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the way in which he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">break us</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">out of a whole way in which we try to</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">the ultimate concerns around personhood</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">and gets us the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">socrates does the same thing he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">reorient how we care</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">all of these individuals if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">me a</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:10.240" style="s2">a happy metaphor they open up the field</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.520" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">of human</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">personhood of human and correspondingly</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">human experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">and i think that is what we need right</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">now and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">again yeah how do we distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">the curse is here too right curse is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.079" style="s2">right on this right you&#39;re asking the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">same question how you distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.079" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">the person who&#39;s truly playing the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">infinite game yes and then the person</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">who looks like they might be playing the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">infinite game that&#39;s actually doing a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">really sneaky finite game</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">yeah and that is very very important</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">right now i put to you that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">proposing to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">that that is kind of one of the central</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">problems we&#39;re facing because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">the cyber technology can super inflate</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">it can give such a simulcam</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">of somebody playing the infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:57.359" style="s2">because there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">complexity and there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.359" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">information flowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s all of these diverse models</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">that can be played with</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:05.200" style="s2">but that person is still ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">right ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.200" end="00:59:08.240" style="s2">just being the antichrist well so some</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">this is almost i&#39;m almost like a random</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">walk space but check this out</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:15.839" style="s2">okay um so the infinite game has</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.839" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">yes it&#39;s almost the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">continuity is the infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">the finite game is always has</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">discontinuity it&#39;s like a digital matrix</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">layered on top of the fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">transcendent if you can engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.599" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">stochastic hop from model to model this</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">actually by the way throws off</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">sociopaths like crazy um</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">the lack of continuity will show up does</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">that make sense what i&#39;m saying yep</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:45.839" style="s2">absolutely you can decode it yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">plugs into what you and i were saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.839" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">jordan about</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:50.799" style="s2">the new this new notion of faith as</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">continuity of contact</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.799" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">right yes spontaneity of contact with</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">the continuum of reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">yes yes so by the way this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.400" end="01:00:00.720" style="s2">the secret of what i do</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">is exactly that like the inside of being</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.720" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">of doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">paradigm and domain switching on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">stochastic basis to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">to filter out those who are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">actually parse things through</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">a semantic cognitive fine game</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">methodology and only hang on those who</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">are actually operating from</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">seoul okay yeah so this is okay so for</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">me this is quadrant quadratic coherence</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">okay so quadrants refer to the willberry</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">in perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">can i spell coherence with the q now so</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve got the three cues</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">do it man absolutely coherent</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">how&#39;s that all right so so now but then</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">the issue right is the coherence and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">integrity of the system obviously this</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">says this so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">crucial to human consciousness is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">much you filter in between the private</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">and the public</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">all right you have to then organize and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.319" style="s2">if your motive structure is actually to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">deceive in relation</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:52.079" style="s2">at some level there&#39;s a there is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">disconnect in the frequency</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:56.960" style="s2">and and dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">and seeking that epistemological</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">and and that to me that would be an</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">indicator of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">chris a very strong powerful check</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">indicator yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">what i&#39;d be looking for and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">in a context where the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">context of reality is shifting very</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">rapidly this is john our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">the other day about</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">the end of paradigmatic mind if the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">context of reality is shifting within</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:20.079" style="s2">within the time frame where you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">actually re-sync your lack of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.079" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">fundamental integrity</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to start freaking the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2"> out right right because then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">get disco</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">you get the coherence yeah because you</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">try to harmonize it because it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to force the issue</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">so keep key message here by the way for</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">those who are interested in the next</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">if you want to endure the transition</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:40.880" style="s2">under which we are going</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">dispense with in lack of integrity in</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.880" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:44.960" style="s2">because part of the reason why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:47.359" style="s2">freaking out is you can no longer</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.960" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">maintain your lack of integrity</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.359" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">if you respond and reduce back to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:53.200" style="s2">fundamental integrity</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">then the complexity or the chaos of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.200" end="01:01:56.720" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">no longer will hit against that surface</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:01:59.920" style="s2">they can&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">and by the way that&#39;s also the step of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.920" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">returning to the groundedness of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:05.039" style="s2">meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">the return into fellowship which by the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.039" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">way also</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">shows up as the return into the commons</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">so those are these are all happening</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:15.440" style="s2">right so yeah you&#39;re getting sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">very complex</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.440" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">multi-level uh reciprocal opening going</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">kind of thing is that my understanding</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">absolutely across levels and dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:27.520" style="s2">we can get you can achieve coherence</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:28.880" style="s2">or not and then and the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.520" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">sociopath dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.880" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">has an incoherent in it almost by</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">by by definition right okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">so this this then plugs into an aspect</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">of cars</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:43.119" style="s2">and it also picks up on whitehead so</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.119" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">these kinds of these kinds of antichrist</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:51.760" style="s2">perversions wow</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t notice uttering this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.760" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">whitehead said though the one saving</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">grace we always have is that evil is</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">ultimately self-destructive</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:07.359" style="s2">that there&#39;s that right that yes right</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">right because it&#39;s engaged because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:09.680" style="s2">ultimately doing stuff that&#39;s reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">narrowing</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">and incoherent it ultimately is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">self-destructive and this is why you see</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">like but so let&#39;s do the prussian state</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">you know the depression state</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s going to have difficulty long</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">terms um</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:27.440" style="s2">and what you see is initially those</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">states take off uh think of world war ii</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.440" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">uh germany takes off</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">right but the nazi state</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">precisely lacks a capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">it right it has no capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">continuity and the democracies actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">eventually overtake</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">now there&#39;s also all kinds of other but</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">the capacity for self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">where where what&#39;s going on there then</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:54.480" style="s2">if i understand it and this is a dewian</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:57.680" style="s2">perspective is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.480" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">what what the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.680" end="01:04:00.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to call it uh that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.960" end="01:04:07.119" style="s2">or maybe it keeps his idea of an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">there is we&#39;re looking for people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.119" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">a component of wisdom enhanced relevance</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">that can discern when</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">they are they are involved in a process</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:24.799" style="s2">that has the self-correcting capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">maintain a continuity of development</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.799" end="01:04:28.160" style="s2">is that is that is that capturing it</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.160" end="01:04:32.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s working for me and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">actually let me let me track it into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">uh updated tripartite model of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">consciousness you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">so i&#39;d say experiential phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">coming out of the whole brain</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">and the the layer there is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:44.960" style="s2">attentional filter okay where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">witnessing function pulling whole brain</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.960" end="01:04:48.400" style="s2">and on top of that you have a narrator</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s narrating the witnessing function</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.400" end="01:04:50.720" style="s2">what it&#39;s seen and creating a</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:53.839" style="s2">justification narrative</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.720" end="01:04:55.440" style="s2">of identity then you have a public self</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.839" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">that is now saying i&#39;m going to justify</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">what it is that i&#39;m doing in relation</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">yeah right you call those what the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:02.000" style="s2">intentional filter the freighting filter</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">the ligerian filter</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.000" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">bingo exactly right and so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">the disco here d coherence is going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">right somewhere in there there is an</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">attentional system that&#39;s hiding an</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">episodic memory</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:16.720" style="s2">a justified intent another an othering</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">of what the actual game is that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.720" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">played</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">and through the attentional filter the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">freudian filter rogerian filter there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">not authenticity so we&#39;re tracking the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:29.280" style="s2">filters through the interface between</p>

<p begin="01:05:29.280" end="01:05:32.559" style="s2">justification so this is then this is</p>

<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s developmental i mean the horizontal</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:15.839" style="s2">time in one state i&#39;m trying to get it</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to propose it as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.839" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">developmental accident</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:20.160" style="s2">right i&#39;m i&#39;m on it i&#39;m on it so i want</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.160" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">go ahead and i just i want to quickly</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.559" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">just invoke the cue continuum just fyi</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s my modification of the three cues</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">um in in the sense that continuity if</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">it&#39;s continuity is continuity with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.039" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">so we were just kind of looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">from the lens of continuity more or less</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">in sort of the sense of self</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">okay and itself in relationship and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:44.839" style="s2">we did like objective</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">but that notion of like the polynesian</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.839" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">continuity is continuity right once you</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:55.200" style="s2">begin to hit on that and you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">hold that and recognize that once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">out of integrity you&#39;re out of integrity</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">with the whole universe</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.119" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">all right that&#39;s good that is good the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.599" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">flow with nature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:12.079" style="s2">at the center of taoism and at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:13.440" style="s2">center of stoicis</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.079" end="01:07:14.799" style="s2">all right being able to and all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.440" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">great wisdom traditions right really</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.799" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">they do they plug you in they transcend</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">the ego and then all of a sudden you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">in a non-dual oneness</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">so we should we should open up the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.599" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">metaphor then you know i&#39;m an ecology</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">of functions that needs an ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">that will put me into the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">nature i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what needs to happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s right all right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">which is atonement</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:44.240" style="s2">yes yes coming back home</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">in which the antichrist fakes and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.240" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">have to have to find that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">and then you know boom and and have</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">the walls of the civilian is about</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">bringing you know the good faith flow</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">into death that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">and then and and the bounty is in fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">the recognition that we live in a moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:03.280" style="s2">where within the context of the walls of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">the civilian</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.280" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">and held by the fellowship the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:09.599" style="s2">possibility of abundance is made real</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">yes absolutely yes and if we do it</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">developmentally from a you know to go</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:14.720" style="s2">back to the early phases of childhood if</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:15.839" style="s2">we start resonating early in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.720" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">attachment structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.839" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">and we do that healthy with a with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">educational developmental structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">then the opportunity to grow people</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:27.600" style="s2">ready through and through</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">much more present right because then</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.600" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not corrupted</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.520" end="01:08:33.600" style="s2">but then we need to change the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">educational system and this is zack</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.600" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">stein&#39;s argument i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:39.679" style="s2">i think but this goes back to what i</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.560" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">said we have to move</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">out of a model of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">person that is exhausted by the notions</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">of consumer and citizens</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">we have to get what is we have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">we have to enrich the model of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">personhood it is good and fine and right</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">that we are talking about all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">but right we people people have to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">like they have to have a model of</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">personhood that enables and affords and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">legitimates that process</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:10.080" style="s2">right so that i came across uh this guy</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">peter osorio developed thing called</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.080" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">descriptive psychology i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">anything about it but it&#39;s this little</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:16.799" style="s2">sort of and and crucial to him is what</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">is a person all right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.799" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">essentially what he articulates very</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">different than a human being</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">a person is what a human being learns to</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">become yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">right um and what he said is it&#39;s i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">put it slightly in my language</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:33.199" style="s2">it&#39;s the capacity to justify yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">a social stage and take account</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.199" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">and responsibility for your actions</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially what it is that a</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:41.359" style="s2">person is</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:43.679" style="s2">okay um so then we put that in and our</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:46.960" style="s2">fundamental responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.679" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">is the good faith participation in</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.960" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">the commons in the in the harmonizing</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">of the structure then now you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:56.800" style="s2">justifiable accountability</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">now that that the person then to become</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.800" end="01:10:01.199" style="s2">clean in relationship to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">will become a concept that plugs in i</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.199" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">believe to that</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">structure yeah just you know again i</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">want to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">communicate back out to anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">observing</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:14.960" style="s2">that one of the very powerful insights</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:16.800" style="s2">that i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.960" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">this that simplifies but reduces the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.800" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">is is to say look how okay how are we</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">gonna do this</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:25.280" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s like two immediate</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">flags</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.280" end="01:10:28.960" style="s2">this is absolutely not in the least bit</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">utopian</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.960" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">um and it&#39;s also not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">idealistic</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">right what i&#39;m going to say is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of practical</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:38.239" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:40.239" style="s2">how do we do these kinds of things in</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.239" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">very specific cases</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.239" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">and in almost every one of those cases</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">my answer is i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">but i i&#39;ve noticed just in this</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">conversation that greg&#39;s got some pretty</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">and john&#39;s got some pretty cool and</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re all operating with</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">those three</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">basics we&#39;re operating with a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">strong orientation towards personal</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">interpersonal dignity and a collective</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">orientation towards the access monday</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">of the uh of the well-being of each and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:11.679" style="s2">are mutually combined then i get the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">benefit of craig&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.679" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">and so i can start saying okay well i</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:17.360" style="s2">don&#39;t need to know it&#39;s not my job to</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">know the things i don&#39;t know it&#39;s my job</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.360" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">to know the things i know</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">to be very strong in those and skillful</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:24.640" style="s2">and bring them with</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:25.440" style="s2">generosity into the collective endeavor</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.640" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">and then to</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.440" end="01:11:29.199" style="s2">be able to find the network the comments</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:31.120" style="s2">right the networks</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.199" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">the comments combine those two words</p>
