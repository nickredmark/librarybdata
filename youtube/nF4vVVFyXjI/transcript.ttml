<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:03.929" style="s2">yes I agree with that I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.100" end="00:00:06.029" style="s2">very good point that Anderson brought up</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">and thank you for pointing that out</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.029" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s interesting because and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">that has to do and with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:19.740" style="s2">degree to which we how should we take</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:22.260" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey within the martial</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.740" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">arts and I know Rafe Kelly is again</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.260" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">doing work on this explicitly but what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">you set up what you said brings out a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:32.520" style="s2">really important point and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:34.910" style="s2">towards something I&#39;ve been doing quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">a bit of work on recently which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">trying to work try to build on the work</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">of La Paul and transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">and Agnes Cal art and aspiration right</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">where you may think that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">there&#39;s video allow me there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">this way in she can frame the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">journey I&#39;m going to defeat all of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">opponents I&#39;m going to defeat all of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">peers right but there you could also</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">think of the hero&#39;s journey as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:10.049" style="s2">aspirational one which is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">future self that I want to be that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.049" end="00:01:17.159" style="s2">not currently that self right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">self that you know has perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">virtues and prep and preferences that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have this is perhaps and wiser</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">self or a more rational self or a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">virtuous self and that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.220" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">that&#39;s a different hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">because now the relationship is between</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">your current self and your future self</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:42.630" style="s2">because the skills you need to build are</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">not just the skills of combat or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.630" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">skills let&#39;s call them the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:48.649" style="s2">victory you need to but you need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">build up these important skills that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.649" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">peak like I&#39;m this agent right now in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">this particular arena this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">who I am and this is how I see and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">understand the world and I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:03.689" style="s2">that person if you&#39;ll allow me to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">space to refer to time right I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.689" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">be that person over there a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">person living in a different world is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">why people go into therapy right they</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">want to be a different person and living</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:16.030" style="s2">in a different world they want to right</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:17.950" style="s2">and so their skills I&#39;ve get the skills</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.030" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">of moving between worlds in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:24.070" style="s2">existential sensible world are not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:26.710" style="s2">same skills as combat they are not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.070" end="00:02:28.210" style="s2">same skills as common you as a and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.710" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">agree with you I think you can develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.210" end="00:02:33.670" style="s2">your skills of combat and be best in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">that sense but if you have not engaged</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.670" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">in a lot of the processes that I talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">about the inactive analogy and a Gog aid</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:42.700" style="s2">of serious play this is all in my series</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:44.380" style="s2">for people who want to take a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.700" end="00:02:46.030" style="s2">look at these ideas but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">cultivate these skills let&#39;s call them</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.030" end="00:02:51.550" style="s2">the skills of transformation that trans</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:53.620" style="s2">frame you from one world to another</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.550" end="00:02:56.350" style="s2">you can have your combat skills at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.620" end="00:03:01.150" style="s2">very high level and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.350" end="00:03:06.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve aspired very much at all right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.150" end="00:03:13.080" style="s2">I agree with you that if people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.690" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">trying to incorporate the hero mythos</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.080" end="00:03:20.770" style="s2">into their martial practice they should</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:24.550" style="s2">sit down and reflect well which way do I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.770" end="00:03:26.620" style="s2">want it do I want it this way like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.550" end="00:03:29.260" style="s2">know I just want to be able to defeat my</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.620" end="00:03:31.480" style="s2">contemporaries is that the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.260" end="00:03:34.990" style="s2">journey on I&#39;m on or is the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:38.320" style="s2">journey right I want to I want to move</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.990" end="00:03:40.240" style="s2">to that person in that world and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.320" end="00:03:41.320" style="s2">because then what you have to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.240" end="00:03:41.890" style="s2">have to do with what we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.320" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.890" end="00:03:46.360" style="s2">Dondre you have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:47.980" style="s2">cultivating all of these other things so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:50.770" style="s2">you can develop the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.980" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">transcendence and trance framing not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.770" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">just the skills of conv</p>
