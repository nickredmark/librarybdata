<p begin="00:00:01.159" end="00:00:10.580" style="s2">so today I&#39;m talking to two of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.810" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">compatriots I suppose in this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.580" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">discussion in Canada about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">issues including compelled speech and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">met Jared brown and Bruce party</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">Jared&#39;s a practicing lawyer and Bruce is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.689" end="00:00:30.750" style="s2">a professor at Queen&#39;s University in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">law school there and I met them both</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.750" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">when we were when we manifested a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">interest last year in bill C 16 which we</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">all regarded as a piece of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">that was infringing on the rights to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">free speech of Canadian individuals in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">manner that hadn&#39;t been ever attempted</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">before and more recently the Law Society</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">of Upper Canada soon to be known as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">Law Society of Ontario has put forward a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">requirement for all of its members so</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">all of the lawyers in Ontario to produce</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">a document of principle that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">been talking about the three of us have</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">been talking about that we regard as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">another but far more egregious example</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">of compelled speech so I&#39;m going to let</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">Jared introduce himself and say a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">bit about who he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">he testified with me at the Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">Senate last year and Bruce party also</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">testified at the Senate on Bill c16 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">Bruce was also the lawyer that I debated</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">he played devil&#39;s advocate at Queen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">University of some of you watching this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">will be familiar with that video so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">Jared oh let you introduce yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">then Bruce and then Bruce Bruce recently</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">wrote a column for the now she will post</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">on this new requirement by the Law</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">Society and so we&#39;re going to let him</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">begin the discussion proper on to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">Jared I&#39;m an everyday litigator I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">commercial litigator in Toronto I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">been practicing for about 15 years doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">increasingly more and more human race</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">tribunal work things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">obviously stepped into the breach on c16</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">and as far as I can tell I may have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:14.550" style="s2">the only practicing lawyer that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">actually spoke out against the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.550" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">legislation there were certainly a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">of lawyers including the Canadian Bar</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">Association that were arraigned in favor</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">of the legislation but as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">tell boots on the ground I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">the only one so I&#39;ve got a pretty benign</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:38.580" style="s2">practice but but certainly have taken up</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">the fight of people Bruce thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.580" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">well this this issue arose for me a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">couple of weeks ago when I received an</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">email from the Law Society and all</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.600" style="s2">lawyers get these emails to do various</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:54.240" style="s2">things but this was different because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.600" end="00:02:57.900" style="s2">announced a new requirement for this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.240" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">year now Jared I think was aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:02.160" style="s2">developing but before I was but but like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:04.020" style="s2">many other lawyers in the province this</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">is was the first indication that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.020" end="00:03:09.960" style="s2">new requirement existed and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">the email said but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.960" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">that said amongst others was that every</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">licensed lawyer now is required to draft</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">and submit what they are calling a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">statement of principles and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">statement is is required to express your</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">agreement and the value you place on</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:38.730" style="s2">inclusion diversity and equality and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">fact that you will actively promote</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.730" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">those values and that&#39;s me just sprung</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">off the screen as a radius example of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.320" style="s2">forced speech of the same kind that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.709" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">were talking about under ability 16 but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.320" end="00:04:02.270" style="s2">but worse this one actually requires you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.380" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">to make a full-fledged statement that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.270" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">will be subject to their approval in</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:11.610" style="s2">order to maintain your license in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">words this is not a matter of it being</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.610" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">suggested to you that you might also</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">want to do this this is a condition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">your ability to practice law in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.660" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">province of Ontario so this destruct me</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">as a matter that needed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:31.530" style="s2">publicly I needed to be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:35.039" style="s2">amongst lawyers in the province because</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.530" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">this is a a slow march to a dark place I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.039" end="00:04:39.590" style="s2">think and that&#39;s where it all began</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:42.120" style="s2">yeah well it was concerning to me when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.590" end="00:04:44.039" style="s2">encountered this I mean I&#39;m the member</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">of a college as well a college of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.039" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">psychologists and my sense of this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:52.259" style="s2">that if the lawyers fall stand and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:54.150" style="s2">go along with this the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.259" end="00:04:56.699" style="s2">this will be required of every</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.150" end="00:04:59.580" style="s2">professional in Ontario and then very</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.699" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">rapidly every professional in Canada is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.580" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">extremely high because if the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">who are you know a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">disagreeable Bunch and who are very</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">familiar with the law and with common</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">law in general are willing to have their</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">political beliefs dictated to them by</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.080" end="00:05:17.069" style="s2">their college then the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:20.069" style="s2">the rest of us will be able to withstand</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.069" end="00:05:21.990" style="s2">that I think is extremely low well as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.069" end="00:05:24.389" style="s2">strong a strong independent bar is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.990" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">always supposed to be the defense or at</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.389" end="00:05:27.599" style="s2">least one line of defense against</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">tyranny or against government overreach</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.599" end="00:05:34.130" style="s2">and and by having the lawyers through</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:37.469" style="s2">under the guise of their regulatory body</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">being compelled to speak or or share</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.469" end="00:05:41.940" style="s2">opinions it&#39;s obviously something scary</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:43.409" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s something that lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.940" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">should wake up to and they need to push</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.409" end="00:05:48.990" style="s2">back against compelled speech which was</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">obviously the issue on c16 is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.990" end="00:05:55.080" style="s2">particularly nefarious infringement and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">intrusion yeah well I mean it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.080" end="00:05:58.979" style="s2">thing to put restrictions on what people</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">can say I mean I know you can&#39;t insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.979" end="00:06:04.770" style="s2">someone to crime for example but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:07.409" style="s2">completely different thing to require</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.770" end="00:06:11.009" style="s2">people to espouse a particular political</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.409" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">stance especially when when it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.009" end="00:06:15.659" style="s2">reviewed by what&#39;s essentially an</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.690" end="00:06:18.590" style="s2">arbitrary committee and and when the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.659" end="00:06:20.819" style="s2">punishment is socha as draconian as us</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.590" end="00:06:23.009" style="s2">potentially losing your right to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.819" end="00:06:25.259" style="s2">practice and that that&#39;s enforced as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.009" end="00:06:27.389" style="s2">mandatory like the first step was to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.259" end="00:06:30.599" style="s2">make that mandatory rather than as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.389" end="00:06:32.819" style="s2">suggestion and so let&#39;s let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.599" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">emphasize at this point the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.819" end="00:06:38.760" style="s2">between restrictions on speech which</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:40.470" style="s2">which are not good things and hour</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.760" end="00:06:42.600" style="s2">debatable and so on but this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.470" end="00:06:44.640" style="s2">category impression this is compelled</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.600" end="00:06:47.190" style="s2">speech this is a requirement that makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">you say something you may not agree with</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.190" end="00:06:53.100" style="s2">and as I mentioned it&#39;ll be in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:54.900" style="s2">column a statements from the Supreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.100" end="00:06:56.550" style="s2">Court of Canada and maybe I&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.900" end="00:06:58.980" style="s2">out one of those just just to make the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.550" end="00:07:03.000" style="s2">point because even the court has said</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.980" end="00:07:06.180" style="s2">explicitly that that this is this is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.000" end="00:07:08.460" style="s2">on in a in a free society you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.180" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">the words of the Supreme Court forcing</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.850" end="00:07:22.860" style="s2">like Canada even for the repression of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.910" end="00:07:26.520" style="s2">the most serious crimes which of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.860" end="00:07:28.680" style="s2">is not in question here yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.520" end="00:07:31.170" style="s2">sorry Jordan that was that was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.680" end="00:07:33.300" style="s2">cornerstone of not only the opinion</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.170" end="00:07:35.220" style="s2">piece that I I put up on my website</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.300" end="00:07:36.510" style="s2">about c16 but also in the cornerstone of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.220" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">the presentation that was made to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.510" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">Senate is that this is a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:43.350" style="s2">egregious infringement on freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.200" style="s2">expression you&#39;re having to mouth</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.200" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">own and the government is forcing you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.850" end="00:07:52.350" style="s2">do it and obviously in this instance</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your regulatory body which</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.350" end="00:07:58.020" style="s2">which holds your license in your ability</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:00.150" style="s2">to carry on the livelihood in the chosen</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.020" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">profession that you&#39;re in telling you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.150" end="00:08:04.440" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got to start voicing these</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">opinions so Jared wouldn&#39;t we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.440" end="00:08:08.070" style="s2">before to one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">pointed out and Bruce you had commented</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.070" end="00:08:13.350" style="s2">on this as well is that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">Law Society Administration theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.350" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">did some background work before deciding</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:20.419" style="s2">that this was a necessity and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:25.229" style="s2">produced a report essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.419" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">proclaiming that the law people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.229" end="00:08:30.270" style="s2">practicing law in Ontario are</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:33.719" style="s2">essentially racist in their orientation</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.270" end="00:08:36.210" style="s2">which is why this this racist and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.719" end="00:08:39.690" style="s2">perhaps misogynist as well which is why</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.210" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2">this piece of administrative let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.690" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">it law or requirements has come into</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:46.530" style="s2">practice but it isn&#39;t obvious that their</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">own data support that conclusion I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.530" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">you can easily read what they wrote as</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:52.920" style="s2">pretty providing pretty compelling</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">evidence that the legal profession the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.920" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">demographics of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.880" end="00:08:58.740" style="s2">legal profession for what that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:02.490" style="s2">you are transforming quite rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.740" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">so the the thing that concerned me as</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.490" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">well from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.930" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">about this sort of thing is that lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.340" style="s2">who agreed to participate in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:14.490" style="s2">process are basically admitting their</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.340" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">racism and misogyny on a conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.490" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">unconscious basis as their by convicting</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:20.670" style="s2">themselves like they&#39;re they&#39;re guilty</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:22.260" style="s2">to begin with they and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.670" end="00:09:24.570" style="s2">an opportunity to prove their innocence</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.260" end="00:09:27.000" style="s2">and by by going along with these</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.570" end="00:09:29.400" style="s2">requirements they&#39;re basically admitting</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.000" end="00:09:31.320" style="s2">through their action that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.400" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">accusations that are being thrown at</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.320" end="00:09:36.060" style="s2">them both individually and as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:40.140" style="s2">collective are are not only accurate but</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:43.500" style="s2">require immediate remediation yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.140" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">I mean the the Rekha or the requirement</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.500" end="00:09:48.090" style="s2">that&#39;s being rolled out right now is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">result of a I think it&#39;s about a 58 page</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.090" end="00:09:53.130" style="s2">report that had 13 recommendations that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">were passed by convocation which is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.130" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">governing body of the Law Society and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:00.870" style="s2">the report itself was entitled</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">strategies to address issues of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.870" end="00:10:07.860" style="s2">racism I mean that statement on its own</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">is saying that our industry as well as</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.860" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">the law society organization itself is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">systemically racist and and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.180" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a to me I&#39;m you know it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">bold statement and one that I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">requires some level of scrutiny you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.230" end="00:10:25.650" style="s2">that the group that came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:28.440" style="s2">report is an esteemed group these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.650" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">all highly respected well accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.440" end="00:10:33.210" style="s2">individuals and and you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.970" style="s2">body of data that they&#39;ve produced as</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.210" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">well as some qualitative anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.970" end="00:10:40.470" style="s2">stories as to some of the the issues</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:42.660" style="s2">that are being faced by by what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.470" end="00:10:44.760" style="s2">call racialized licensees I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.660" end="00:10:45.810" style="s2">data is something that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.760" end="00:10:47.700" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to look at but I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.810" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">encourage people to look at it and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.700" end="00:10:52.590" style="s2">see what what the basis on that finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:56.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re a systemic ly racist industry</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.590" end="00:10:58.950" style="s2">and an obviously profession I encourage</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.040" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">people to look at it study the report I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.950" end="00:11:02.280" style="s2">can assure you that most most lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:03.990" style="s2">won&#39;t 58 pages</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.280" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">something that happened back in December</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.990" end="00:11:08.339" style="s2">but it there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of shocking</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.709" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">information in there and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.339" end="00:11:13.050" style="s2">obviously some shocking findings but ya</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:15.779" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s got me concerned because</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.050" end="00:11:18.740" style="s2">my my industry has now been deemed</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.779" end="00:11:20.430" style="s2">racist by the body that governs it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.740" end="00:11:22.950" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.430" end="00:11:26.430" style="s2">appalling about that and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">also about the requirements for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.430" end="00:11:31.950" style="s2">statement of principles is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:35.070" style="s2">a pronounced ideological bent to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.950" end="00:11:37.529" style="s2">and the first is the idea of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.070" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">racism because the way that you prove</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.529" end="00:11:44.010" style="s2">systemic racism is is I would say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:46.170" style="s2">say call it questionable method</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.010" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">logically to say the least because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.170" end="00:11:52.170" style="s2">basic concept is is that you divide the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:55.230" style="s2">population up by racial ethnic and sex</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.170" end="00:11:57.209" style="s2">based identification which you can do in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.230" end="00:12:01.950" style="s2">a very large number of ways by the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.209" end="00:12:04.740" style="s2">and then you compare any organization to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.950" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">that population-based division and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.740" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">the the ratio of individuals categorized</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:14.370" style="s2">in the general population isn&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:16.230" style="s2">as the ratio of individuals in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.370" end="00:12:18.209" style="s2">profession then you can automatically</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.230" end="00:12:20.550" style="s2">make a case for systemic racism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.209" end="00:12:22.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very weak methodology no</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.550" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">credible scientist would regard that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.980" end="00:12:28.709" style="s2">I go we would regard that as proof of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.410" end="00:12:30.990" style="s2">anything and worse I can&#39;t imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.709" end="00:12:33.329" style="s2">anything any claim like that would stand</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.990" end="00:12:35.520" style="s2">up in something resembling a court of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.329" end="00:12:37.560" style="s2">law if you know if it was possible to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.520" end="00:12:38.940" style="s2">take a group to court because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.560" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">all sorts of reasons why there might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.940" end="00:12:43.140" style="s2">differential representation in a group</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:45.930" style="s2">and that and that is assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.140" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what the data shows and in many</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:51.000" style="s2">respects this actually not what this</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:54.600" style="s2">data shows so I take your point about</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.000" end="00:12:56.130" style="s2">the methodology but but even so even if</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.600" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">you accept that methodology it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.130" end="00:13:00.690" style="s2">crystal clear that that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">numbers actually suggest when I get back</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:05.430" style="s2">for a moment to your to your implication</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:07.890" style="s2">point I mean I agree that that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.430" end="00:13:10.589" style="s2">requirement to make this statement in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.890" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">this context essentially could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.589" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">interpreted as though you are required</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:17.550" style="s2">to make a confession about what it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:19.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve done wrongly in the past and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.550" end="00:13:22.730" style="s2">it is you will do now in the present</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.400" end="00:13:25.970" style="s2">to correct it as an individual and there</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.730" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">is also the the trouble that once you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.970" end="00:13:30.050" style="s2">have written the statement so as to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:32.300" style="s2">comply with the requirement then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.050" end="00:13:35.030" style="s2">have on the record a statement of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:37.730" style="s2">it is that you believe and thereafter</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.030" end="00:13:39.710" style="s2">your future actions can be compared to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.730" end="00:13:42.980" style="s2">that statement so as to show that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.710" end="00:13:46.100" style="s2">are not acting in compliance with what</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.980" end="00:13:47.450" style="s2">you have said you believe or that on one</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.100" end="00:13:50.420" style="s2">occasion or the other you haven&#39;t been</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.420" end="00:13:53.570" style="s2">heard some lawyers say in response to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.890" end="00:13:55.130" style="s2">this requirement that oh well so this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.570" end="00:13:56.330" style="s2">not a big deal because I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.130" end="00:13:57.020" style="s2">write the statement they&#39;ll put it in</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.020" end="00:14:02.360" style="s2">and sit in some corner of the law</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.360" end="00:14:04.580" style="s2">big deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">but it actually it is a very big deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.580" end="00:14:10.670" style="s2">because there they are hurting you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:13.310" style="s2">towards both a certain way to think a</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.310" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">certain restriction on your behavior and</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.820" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">about this kind of law and right but</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.310" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">also you&#39;re subscribing to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.790" style="s2">that the system is racist that the that</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.790" end="00:14:37.400" style="s2">themselves are racist and that to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.310" end="00:14:39.770" style="s2">that implies hopelessly corrupt and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.400" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">shocks me and I don&#39;t think I want my</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:48.200" style="s2">course you know we&#39;ve got an issue here</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.890" end="00:14:50.870" style="s2">and and it&#39;s not entirely clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.200" end="00:14:52.280" style="s2">from reading the report that we do but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.870" end="00:14:53.960" style="s2">mean Jordan may have some comments</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.280" end="00:14:55.400" style="s2">obviously about writing writing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.960" end="00:14:57.830" style="s2">statement and a declaration and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.400" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">that means but I just find that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.830" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">having to affirm in a statement that our</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">industry is is hopelessly corrupt is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:09.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not something I&#39;m willing to do at</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:11.780" style="s2">this point well over the last year is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.140" end="00:15:13.460" style="s2">that apologizing or admitting guilt to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.780" end="00:15:15.140" style="s2">ideologue this is an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.460" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">dangerous thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.140" end="00:15:20.330" style="s2">because all it&#39;s taken as as Bruce</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:23.780" style="s2">basically alluded to is a statement of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.330" end="00:15:25.580" style="s2">guilt and you know the other problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.780" end="00:15:27.530" style="s2">from a psychological perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.580" end="00:15:30.200" style="s2">and this this there&#39;s a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.530" end="00:15:31.939" style="s2">psychological literature on this so know</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">if you have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.939" end="00:15:36.949" style="s2">set of philosophical positions let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:38.269" style="s2">principles let&#39;s call them and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.949" end="00:15:40.789" style="s2">your principles are something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.269" end="00:15:43.159" style="s2">excellence meritocracy and honesty which</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.789" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">strike me as a better set of principles</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.159" end="00:15:47.529" style="s2">for lawyers than diversity and equity</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:50.449" style="s2">and inclusiveness not that those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.529" end="00:15:53.839" style="s2">you know in in certain context and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.449" end="00:15:55.339" style="s2">carefully defined also important if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.839" end="00:15:56.989" style="s2">write a statement of principle</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.339" end="00:16:00.259" style="s2">especially one that&#39;s going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.989" end="00:16:02.119" style="s2">pass muster then what will happen is you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.259" end="00:16:04.549" style="s2">will bring your beliefs and your actions</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.119" end="00:16:06.889" style="s2">in line with that statement of principle</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.549" end="00:16:08.989" style="s2">you&#39;ll do that unconsciously and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.889" end="00:16:10.699" style="s2">a bunch of reasons for that and one</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.989" end="00:16:13.789" style="s2">reason is is that you&#39;ve now made a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.699" end="00:16:15.769" style="s2">coherent and credible argument in favor</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.789" end="00:16:17.949" style="s2">of that set of principles and you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.769" end="00:16:19.939" style="s2">find that convincing because</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.949" end="00:16:22.429" style="s2">articulating yourself in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.939" end="00:16:25.689" style="s2">actually changes your character and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.429" end="00:16:29.929" style="s2">second is is that it puts you in into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.689" end="00:16:31.819" style="s2">position that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.929" end="00:16:33.859" style="s2">being described as cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.819" end="00:16:36.259" style="s2">which is one of the most famous findings</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.859" end="00:16:39.709" style="s2">in in psychology and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.259" end="00:16:42.199" style="s2">dissonance is the unpleasant feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.709" end="00:16:44.059" style="s2">that you get when you&#39;re holding two</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.199" end="00:16:46.279" style="s2">opposing beliefs let&#39;s say at the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.059" end="00:16:48.109" style="s2">time and you notice that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.279" end="00:16:49.909" style="s2">cognitive dissonance here would be well</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.109" end="00:16:51.970" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna write this statement of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.909" end="00:16:54.139" style="s2">principles what difference does it make</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.970" end="00:16:55.939" style="s2">however that is a statement of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.139" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">principles and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.939" end="00:17:01.429" style="s2">intrinsically dishonest and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:02.929" style="s2">character damaging to craft a statement</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.429" end="00:17:05.689" style="s2">of principles with which you do not</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.929" end="00:17:08.360" style="s2">agree and so then you can either regard</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.689" end="00:17:10.429" style="s2">yourself as a coward and a liar or you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.360" end="00:17:12.049" style="s2">can bring your thinking in line with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.429" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">statement of principles and that if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.049" end="00:17:16.429" style="s2">latter thing is what people tend to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:19.579" style="s2">and so and then the idea that this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.429" end="00:17:21.470" style="s2">just gonna sit in some musty file drawer</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.579" end="00:17:23.299" style="s2">that&#39;s completely that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.470" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">naive in my estimation because basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.299" end="00:17:26.689" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and I&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:29.149" style="s2">happening with the creep of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.689" end="00:17:31.940" style="s2">committees on the university campuses is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.149" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">that once you decide that you&#39;re guilty</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.940" end="00:17:35.990" style="s2">and that you&#39;re going to abide by a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:39.710" style="s2">set of principles it now becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">incumbent on the law society as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.710" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">of the intrinsic logic of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:45.770" style="s2">movement to do things like check you out</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">on a year</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.770" end="00:17:51.740" style="s2">your basis to see how your attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:53.630" style="s2">behavior is actually in keeping with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.740" end="00:17:55.550" style="s2">your statement of principles it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.630" end="00:17:58.670" style="s2">just gonna hang there in the air it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.550" end="00:18:01.550" style="s2">gonna be in the forest yes and that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.670" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">part of the transition I would say from</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.550" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">the Law Society regulating competence</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:11.390" style="s2">regulating values I mean it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.040" style="s2">at one point that the law study was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.390" end="00:18:15.470" style="s2">there to make sure that you had the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.040" end="00:18:17.570" style="s2">skills to be able to practice law and as</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.470" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">time has gone on they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">overseeing is more and more in the area</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:24.890" style="s2">of what it is that you think and whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.520" end="00:18:27.740" style="s2">or not that thinking is appropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.890" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">one good comparison of this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.740" end="00:18:33.560" style="s2">case involving the Trinity Western law</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:35.150" style="s2">school the the graduates of that laws</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.560" end="00:18:38.930" style="s2">because it is a private let&#39;s go out in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:41.150" style="s2">virtue and they require all their all</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.930" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">their faculty and students to sign on to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.150" end="00:18:45.110" style="s2">a pledge that contains certain values</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">they promise not to do certain things</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.110" end="00:18:52.970" style="s2">like have premarital sex and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.100" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">of other things the Law Society on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.970" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">basis I think that it is inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">for an institution to impose values upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">to people within it have said that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">will not license graduates from that law</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.340" end="00:19:07.370" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">now you might agree or disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.370" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">that perspective but it is hypocritical</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:17.060" style="s2">now that what they have done is the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:19.160" style="s2">thing essentially except with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.060" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">different set of values they have indeed</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">impose a sentence on the people within</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">their own institution it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.230" style="s2">they haven&#39;t chosen different values</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:28.940" style="s2">which means that their objection to turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.230" end="00:19:30.980" style="s2">your question was not really at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.940" end="00:19:33.680" style="s2">about the imposition of the values they</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.980" end="00:19:35.960" style="s2">just don&#39;t like the values the attorney</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.680" end="00:19:38.150" style="s2">Western chose right yeah well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.960" end="00:19:40.730" style="s2">pretty ironic that the argument would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.150" end="00:19:42.650" style="s2">made that an organization doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.730" end="00:19:45.050" style="s2">the right to impose its values on its</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.650" end="00:19:46.430" style="s2">own it&#39;s voluntary participants which we</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.050" end="00:19:48.260" style="s2">should point out because you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.430" end="00:19:50.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go to Trinity Western or</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">signers agreement there&#39;s lots of law</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.660" end="00:19:54.890" style="s2">schools you can go to whereas in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:57.350" style="s2">particular situation you&#39;re basically I</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.890" end="00:19:59.750" style="s2">mean to say that a gun is pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.350" end="00:20:01.940" style="s2">your head is too dramatic obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.750" end="00:20:03.590" style="s2">it&#39;s no joke to be faced with it with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.940" end="00:20:05.480" style="s2">the threat of losing your license and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.590" end="00:20:06.860" style="s2">also to have to undergo what would</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">those are seriously not pleasant if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.690" end="00:20:18.200" style="s2">if you fail to comply no one there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">other there&#39;s other parts of us before</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.200" end="00:20:20.990" style="s2">we leave turn your weapon can we just</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:23.540" style="s2">underline what you just said which i</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.990" end="00:20:26.750" style="s2">think is very important which is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.540" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">that the law society is essentially an</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.750" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">arm of the state it has coercive power</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:34.160" style="s2">given to it by the state to license</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:37.370" style="s2">lawyers and it is the gatekeeper so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.160" end="00:20:40.790" style="s2">have no choice whereas as as you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.370" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">during the the association with Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.790" end="00:20:43.370" style="s2">Western it&#39;s entirely voluntary if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:45.800" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go to that school you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.370" end="00:20:48.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know that school and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.800" end="00:20:50.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s ironic in the extreme that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.110" end="00:20:54.590" style="s2">is the law Society which is that which</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.410" end="00:20:56.270" style="s2">has imposed such a requirement in</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.590" end="00:20:58.580" style="s2">circumstances that is much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.270" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">objectionable than the Trinity Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.580" end="00:21:01.750" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s quite it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">disconcerting to me to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:08.360" style="s2">to see that it&#39;s actually lawyers that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.190" style="s2">are doing this and that have that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.360" end="00:21:12.650" style="s2">that and that they are not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.190" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">seeing or unwilling to see for some</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.650" end="00:21:17.810" style="s2">reasons that I don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:20.630" style="s2">what that this is an egregious assault</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.810" end="00:21:22.910" style="s2">on the rights of well I would say of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.630" end="00:21:25.610" style="s2">lawyers in Ontario but also of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.910" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">individual citizens in Canada it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.610" end="00:21:30.290" style="s2">that the fact that the that it&#39;s lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.890" end="00:21:33.710" style="s2">that are involved in this is really I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.290" end="00:21:36.650" style="s2">find that much more terrifying in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.710" end="00:21:39.940" style="s2">sense than the unfounded or likely</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.650" end="00:21:43.070" style="s2">unfounded accusation that the entire</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.940" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">profession is racist which are also you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.070" end="00:21:48.890" style="s2">know now what are people who are to use</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.220" end="00:21:51.380" style="s2">the hated word racialized which is also</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">an ideological term supposed to conclude</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.380" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">if all the lawyers in Ontario just go</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:21:58.520" style="s2">along with this wholeheartedly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">really supposed to be able to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.520" end="00:22:04.430" style="s2">law firm and trust that their their</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:07.510" style="s2">claims are going to be put forward with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.430" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">with with with fairness and clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.510" end="00:22:12.050" style="s2">commitment if the whole society has</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:13.340" style="s2">already agreed and the lawyers go along</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.050" end="00:22:16.040" style="s2">with it that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.340" end="00:22:18.100" style="s2">physically racist Association and how is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.040" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">that going to do anything but damage</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.100" end="00:22:24.890" style="s2">racial and and sex related what would</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:27.080" style="s2">you call the relationships in Canada I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.890" end="00:22:28.340" style="s2">just can&#39;t see that as anything but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:30.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s supposed to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.340" end="00:22:33.050" style="s2">brings us together in with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.710" end="00:22:34.310" style="s2">let&#39;s call it inclusiveness but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.050" end="00:22:35.480" style="s2">see this is anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.310" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.480" end="00:22:39.560" style="s2">extraordinarily divisive well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">interesting you were you were raising</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.560" end="00:22:43.670" style="s2">the issue of wire lawyers going along</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.550" style="s2">with it or why aren&#39;t they recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.670" end="00:22:47.900" style="s2">the danger you know there was some some</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.550" end="00:22:49.190" style="s2">talk about this at the convocation</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.900" end="00:22:50.780" style="s2">meeting where where these</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.190" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2">recommendations were passed there were</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.780" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">some dissenting voices and very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:22:57.920" style="s2">well-put dissenting voices but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:23:00.290" style="s2">just within my own professional network</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.920" end="00:23:02.810" style="s2">most lawyers don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.290" end="00:23:04.670" style="s2">they got the email they didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.810" end="00:23:06.290" style="s2">anything of it we get a you know twelve</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.670" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">of these things a month it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.290" end="00:23:09.530" style="s2">additional requirement another piece of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:11.240" style="s2">paper now interesting what the Law</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.530" end="00:23:13.880" style="s2">Society has done when they push this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.240" end="00:23:15.680" style="s2">requirement out is they also said by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.880" end="00:23:18.050" style="s2">way if you need some help completing</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.680" end="00:23:20.030" style="s2">this statement of decorative principles</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.050" end="00:23:21.880" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna provide two templates that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.030" end="00:23:24.350" style="s2">would satisfy us and of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.880" end="00:23:26.180" style="s2">ninety-eight percent of the the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.350" end="00:23:27.890" style="s2">that I practice with who are RT time</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.180" end="00:23:30.350" style="s2">crunched what are they gonna do they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.890" end="00:23:33.140" style="s2">gonna file either template a or B get on</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.350" end="00:23:34.340" style="s2">with their life and and so it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.140" end="00:23:37.460" style="s2">those things where you&#39;ve got time</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.340" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">pressed lawyers or licensees and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.460" end="00:23:42.200" style="s2">got a bureaucracy adding a new level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">requirement to them and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.200" end="00:23:47.570" style="s2">going to to go along to get along and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:49.130" style="s2">from what I can tell when I do stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.570" end="00:23:50.630" style="s2">people and ask them about their</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.130" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">statement of principles that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.630" end="00:23:56.420" style="s2">time they&#39;ve actually thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:58.580" style="s2">yeah go ahead Bruce no I wasn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.420" end="00:24:00.680" style="s2">say that the fact that is the template</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.580" end="00:24:02.900" style="s2">that you can choose between you own up</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.680" end="00:24:07.070" style="s2">to the templates yeah that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.900" end="00:24:09.020" style="s2">it less of a concern it&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.070" end="00:24:11.210" style="s2">do you mean I don&#39;t want to overstate</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.020" end="00:24:14.030" style="s2">this but this is it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.210" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">similarities to McCarthyism yes does an</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.030" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">old statement that you know I am not now</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:20.660" style="s2">nor have I ever been a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:23.660" style="s2">Communist Party that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.660" end="00:24:25.340" style="s2">template in the McCarthy era this is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.660" end="00:24:26.990" style="s2">template you have to say certain things</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.340" end="00:24:28.790" style="s2">and and look</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.990" end="00:24:30.890" style="s2">how meaningless it becomes in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.790" end="00:24:34.100" style="s2">actual substance if it&#39;s a templated you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.890" end="00:24:36.710" style="s2">just died on then they have literally</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.100" end="00:24:39.350" style="s2">put words in your mouth and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.710" end="00:24:41.870" style="s2">thing that cannot be a lot of it happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.350" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">yeah well that I agree with that in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.870" end="00:24:46.340" style="s2">couple of ways I mean the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">is that if they were committed to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.340" end="00:24:50.450" style="s2">in any deep sense the last thing they</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:54.230" style="s2">would provide was a template because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.450" end="00:24:56.120" style="s2">idea that you can you could require from</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.230" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">people a statement of principles that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.120" end="00:25:00.230" style="s2">of such fundamental import that if it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">not crafted properly you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.230" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">license and yet that they could produce</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:08.210" style="s2">a template of principles that would see</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:10.550" style="s2">in some manner apply to everyone equally</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.210" end="00:25:11.390" style="s2">is just it&#39;s absurd almost beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.550" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.390" end="00:25:15.380" style="s2">I mean principles actually happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.850" end="00:25:17.690" style="s2">important right from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.380" end="00:25:20.179" style="s2">perspective your deepest principles are</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.690" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">the axioms from which you generate not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.179" end="00:25:24.410" style="s2">only your thoughts and your actions but</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">your perceptions your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.410" end="00:25:28.550" style="s2">responses and your motivations like</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.530" style="s2">there&#39;s virtually nothing more important</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.550" end="00:25:33.290" style="s2">from the perspective of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.530" end="00:25:35.929" style="s2">integrity than your principles and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.290" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">think that those could be reduced to an</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.929" end="00:25:39.679" style="s2">externally produced template and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:43.280" style="s2">that could be imposed as a requirement</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.679" end="00:25:46.280" style="s2">so it would be easier for you is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.280" end="00:25:49.160" style="s2">like it reminds me of the Soviet era</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.280" end="00:25:51.010" style="s2">where there were templates of guilt you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.160" end="00:25:53.480" style="s2">know if you were accused of something</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.010" end="00:25:54.860" style="s2">regardless of whether you were guilty or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.480" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">not because that really wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.860" end="00:26:00.140" style="s2">relevant you&#39;d be required to sign a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:01.550" style="s2">template of guilt essentially and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.140" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">would well and once you&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.550" end="00:26:06.890" style="s2">well you were done and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:09.490" style="s2">quite it&#39;s pretty quite amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.890" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">that from a conceptual philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.490" end="00:26:13.929" style="s2">perspective that that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:17.150" style="s2">could even be considered for a moment as</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.330" end="00:26:25.400" style="s2">as Jared pointed out people are busy and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.790" end="00:26:28.070" style="s2">the other thing is you know when I made</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.070" end="00:26:33.890" style="s2">last year part of what motivated me was</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.100" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">a comment by a colleague and about</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.720" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">is extremely high and the probability</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.779" end="00:26:55.669" style="s2">is very low and so the the logical thing</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.669" end="00:27:00.140" style="s2">time and and also if you want to not put</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:22.250" style="s2">because you&#39;re isolated right you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:29.870" style="s2">sick you&#39;ll early in our profession my</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.429" end="00:27:31.820" style="s2">understanding is that the majority of</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.820" end="00:27:35.059" style="s2">generally practicing in a small firm</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:36.230" style="s2">environment or sole practitioners and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.059" end="00:27:37.700" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.230" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">standing on an island on their own in</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.700" end="00:27:41.000" style="s2">their own practice and they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:43.070" style="s2">to fully appreciate that this is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.000" end="00:27:44.510" style="s2">issue what other people are thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.070" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely going to think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.510" end="00:27:49.640" style="s2">they&#39;re putting their head above the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">herd so it&#39;s we have a unique I think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.640" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">have a unique industry in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.470" end="00:27:58.070" style="s2">well let&#39;s just make it this point at</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">this moment in time which is that all</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.070" end="00:28:04.490" style="s2">those lawyers who think that they may be</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:07.460" style="s2">sticking their head up all by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.490" end="00:28:09.049" style="s2">are actually not because you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.460" end="00:28:11.179" style="s2">have certainly heard from a good number</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.049" end="00:28:15.470" style="s2">of lawyers now who are all extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.179" end="00:28:17.960" style="s2">concerned shocked alarmed at this so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.470" end="00:28:20.630" style="s2">one thing that we want to overcome is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.960" end="00:28:22.760" style="s2">the possible inclination to think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.630" end="00:28:26.059" style="s2">that any lawyer who is concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.760" end="00:28:29.210" style="s2">this is an army of one and that in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.059" end="00:28:31.580" style="s2">situation is not the case so that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.210" end="00:28:35.750" style="s2">there are possibilities here that if if</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.580" end="00:28:39.649" style="s2">people do act upon their concerns and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.750" end="00:28:42.350" style="s2">and the time to comply with this</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.649" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">requirement that the change in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.350" end="00:28:47.809" style="s2">situation actually is a possibility well</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:50.710" style="s2">Bruce there&#39;s also the the the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.809" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">that that were servicing I mean in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.710" end="00:28:54.460" style="s2">private practice world clients clients</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.289" style="s2">are going to watch this they want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.460" end="00:28:58.450" style="s2">know what we&#39;re doing I think they want</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.289" end="00:29:00.279" style="s2">their their lawyers to stand up on their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.450" end="00:29:01.630" style="s2">principles if you will and push back</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.279" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">against something and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.630" end="00:29:05.649" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be to be said in</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">terms of your differentiation in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.649" end="00:29:08.980" style="s2">marketplace particularly in private</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:10.990" style="s2">practice if you do exactly that my</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.980" end="00:29:13.000" style="s2">clients were relying on me to be this</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.990" end="00:29:14.740" style="s2">bulwark against this type of thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.000" end="00:29:16.299" style="s2">think a lot of lawyers should should</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.740" end="00:29:18.340" style="s2">take note of that that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.299" end="00:29:20.770" style="s2">something here worth fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.340" end="00:29:22.750" style="s2">yeah I totally agree I mean really your</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.770" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">your lawyer credibility is at stake here</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.750" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t stand up and protect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">when your own fundamental rights are are</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:33.820" style="s2">being threatened then why should clients</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:36.789" style="s2">believe you have the ability to do so on</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.820" end="00:29:39.820" style="s2">on their back or the inclination to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.789" end="00:29:41.529" style="s2">so you know because by swallowing this</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.820" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">hook line and sinker let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.529" end="00:29:47.559" style="s2">exceeding to what&#39;s essentially an</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:50.020" style="s2">ideological demand then you also brand</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.559" end="00:29:52.539" style="s2">yourself as an avatar of that particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.020" end="00:29:54.760" style="s2">ideology and so that&#39;s another reason to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.539" end="00:29:57.580" style="s2">not be trusted you know that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.760" end="00:29:59.470" style="s2">aspect of inability to stand up for</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.580" end="00:30:03.370" style="s2">yourself or unwillingness to but then</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.470" end="00:30:05.940" style="s2">the to to come out as an active agent</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.370" end="00:30:08.890" style="s2">for this for this particular set of of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.940" end="00:30:10.870" style="s2">let&#39;s call them principles which and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.890" end="00:30:13.870" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no reason to make the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.870" end="00:30:15.940" style="s2">assumption that the whole the new Holy</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:23.380" style="s2">think it&#39;s an extraordinarily weak</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.850" end="00:30:25.149" style="s2">argument that that&#39;s the case there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.380" end="00:30:28.710" style="s2">there&#39;s flaws in it at virtually every</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.149" end="00:30:31.140" style="s2">level of analysis it&#39;s old and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.710" end="00:30:34.659" style="s2">contrary to the central themes of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.140" end="00:30:38.950" style="s2">English common law for example so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.659" end="00:30:40.809" style="s2">make note just for a moment of the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.950" end="00:30:43.029" style="s2">fact that the law society is playing</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.809" end="00:30:44.710" style="s2">that a little bit closer to their chests</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.029" end="00:30:47.799" style="s2">in the sense that they have not spelled</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.710" end="00:30:50.590" style="s2">out what the penalty is going to be for</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.799" end="00:30:52.149" style="s2">those lawyers who decline to to comply</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.590" end="00:30:53.980" style="s2">with this requirement they have only</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.149" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">said in their materials that those</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.980" end="00:30:59.590" style="s2">lawyers who are not a compliance will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">advised of their obligations in writing</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.590" end="00:31:04.539" style="s2">which of course leaves all the choices</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:07.539" style="s2">open to the law society musical</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.539" end="00:31:08.919" style="s2">and that was discussed to some extent at</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.779" end="00:31:17.649" style="s2">speculate but what your obligations are</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.789" end="00:31:19.869" style="s2">typically is to file what&#39;s called the</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.009" end="00:31:34.359" style="s2">it may even turn into something much</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.289" end="00:31:36.219" style="s2">larger than that so I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.359" end="00:31:37.959" style="s2">speculating but absolutely the Law</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.219" end="00:31:40.929" style="s2">Society did not make clear what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.959" end="00:31:43.539" style="s2">to happen if if somebody decides that</p>

<p begin="00:31:48.879" end="00:31:54.459" style="s2">it&#39;s just not reasonable to to specify a</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.459" end="00:31:59.949" style="s2">undefined and it smacks of political</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.549" end="00:32:02.319" style="s2">opportunism from my perspective because</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.829" end="00:32:12.009" style="s2">draconian about this and then can</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.940" end="00:32:41.499" style="s2">of weakness in order to to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:43.479" style="s2">push back against this so in the law</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.499" end="00:32:45.549" style="s2">society it&#39;s all public as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.479" end="00:32:47.079" style="s2">mean the the role of the law society</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.549" end="00:32:48.699" style="s2">from what I understand is to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.079" end="00:32:50.919" style="s2">public from the big bad lawyers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.699" end="00:32:52.749" style="s2">why we are a self-regulating industry</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.919" end="00:32:54.639" style="s2">and one of the things that that the Law</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.749" end="00:32:57.309" style="s2">Society does is it how it makes its</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.639" end="00:32:59.319" style="s2">disciplinary process public so things</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.309" end="00:33:01.479" style="s2">like administrative suspensions or or</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.319" end="00:33:03.099" style="s2">disciplinary action are things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.479" end="00:33:05.199" style="s2">would be known to the public so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.099" end="00:33:06.669" style="s2">out there potentially being tarred and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.199" end="00:33:07.209" style="s2">feathered on this thing and people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.669" end="00:33:09.789" style="s2">going to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.209" end="00:33:11.499" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s extremely important for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.789" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">professional to maintain a pristine</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.499" end="00:33:17.529" style="s2">reputation and even the what would you</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:17.900" style="s2">call it even the suggestion that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.529" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.900" end="00:33:21.050" style="s2">in accordance with even an</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.190" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">administrative detail with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.050" end="00:33:25.790" style="s2">the Law Society is you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:28.310" style="s2">that&#39;s going to put doubt in the mind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.790" end="00:33:30.950" style="s2">anyone who Paul knows you or doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.310" end="00:33:32.810" style="s2">know you so that means the process is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.950" end="00:33:35.720" style="s2">the punishment and that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.810" end="00:33:38.750" style="s2">case with these mid-level organisations</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.720" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">where it seems to me the proclivity for</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.750" end="00:33:45.830" style="s2">a more totalitarian view of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.260" end="00:33:47.000" style="s2">like leaping forward in leaps and in</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.830" end="00:33:49.910" style="s2">leaps and bounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.000" end="00:33:52.970" style="s2">so so should we consider for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.910" end="00:33:54.920" style="s2">what we might suggest to all those</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.970" end="00:33:56.090" style="s2">lawyers who are concerned about this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.920" end="00:33:59.480" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go along with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.090" end="00:34:00.950" style="s2">requirement what it is that what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.480" end="00:34:03.680" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t suggest that they do</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.950" end="00:34:05.000" style="s2">jarick you wanted to take off well it</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.680" end="00:34:07.100" style="s2">seems to be you approach that in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.000" end="00:34:08.600" style="s2">article to National Post in a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:10.550" style="s2">adaptive way and that and my first</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.600" end="00:34:12.980" style="s2">inclination is that is that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.550" end="00:34:15.380" style="s2">file I mean the act of filing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.980" end="00:34:18.110" style="s2">as we&#39;ve already discussed is is half of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.380" end="00:34:20.929" style="s2">the admission of guilt if you will and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.110" end="00:34:23.720" style="s2">mean I think that not filing sense it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.929" end="00:34:25.190" style="s2">sends a good good statement but then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.720" end="00:34:27.470" style="s2">know you want to obviously let them know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.190" end="00:34:29.419" style="s2">why you&#39;re not filing so perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.470" end="00:34:31.909" style="s2">have to send something that would let</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.419" end="00:34:33.470" style="s2">them the Law Society the regulator know</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.909" end="00:34:34.970" style="s2">why you&#39;re not filing I mean those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.470" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">the things that come to mind and you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.970" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">discuss them I think quite well to for</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:42.890" style="s2">them to realize that you didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:44.090" style="s2">forget you actually consciously decided</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.890" end="00:34:45.470" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t the thing that you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.090" end="00:34:47.570" style="s2">going to do I think that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.470" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">idea yes some kind of short statement</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.570" end="00:34:53.780" style="s2">but not it I mean I wouldn&#39;t be inclined</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">to suggest that they should draft their</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.780" end="00:34:59.510" style="s2">own statement of principles that reflect</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">what they actually think because then</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.510" end="00:35:04.310" style="s2">they are actually going three-quarters</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:06.380" style="s2">of the way of what they&#39;ve been asked to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.310" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">do I mean there&#39;s no reason why even if</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.380" end="00:35:10.150" style="s2">the statement says something that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:12.290" style="s2">believe that you should be filing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.150" end="00:35:13.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s still forced speech they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.290" end="00:35:16.220" style="s2">still requiring to make that statement</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.640" end="00:35:18.230" style="s2">so and yes and it&#39;s not it&#39;s none of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.220" end="00:35:19.850" style="s2">their business and and I mean I thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.230" end="00:35:22.130" style="s2">about that myself I thought maybe you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.850" end="00:35:24.500" style="s2">do a google memo you know the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.130" end="00:35:26.360" style="s2">google memo but then I thought no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.500" end="00:35:28.850" style="s2">playing the game you are you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.360" end="00:35:30.050" style="s2">declaring your thoughts to to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.850" end="00:35:31.940" style="s2">regulator and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.050" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">reprehensible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.940" end="00:35:36.740" style="s2">I agree they don&#39;t have any right to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:38.390" style="s2">content of your thoughts not unless</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.740" end="00:35:40.119" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to voluntarily put them</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.390" end="00:35:42.530" style="s2">forward and that&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.119" end="00:35:45.050" style="s2">difference a very big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.530" end="00:35:46.760" style="s2">well the assessment of confidence which</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.050" end="00:35:48.589" style="s2">has already taken place after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.760" end="00:35:51.530" style="s2">passed the bar and you&#39;re in compliance</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.589" end="00:35:54.380" style="s2">with with the regulatory boards</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.530" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">requirements and the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.380" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">should have privileged access to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">deepest principles is I agree that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:03.109" style="s2">absolutely reprehensible there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">excuse for it whatsoever whether you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.109" end="00:36:05.780" style="s2">whether you agree with the principles</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.690" style="s2">they want you to agree with or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.780" end="00:36:12.980" style="s2">reprehensible yes oh yes sighs this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.690" end="00:36:15.589" style="s2">point this is this is not essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.980" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">debate about whether or not those values</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.589" end="00:36:19.640" style="s2">are are good or bad desirable or</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:22.430" style="s2">undesirable this is about the force</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.640" end="00:36:25.130" style="s2">speech first and foremost but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.430" end="00:36:27.290" style="s2">that you can be required to indicate how</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.130" end="00:36:29.060" style="s2">you feel about them and you look rivas</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.290" end="00:36:31.160" style="s2">them in endorsing and so on even if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.060" end="00:36:34.119" style="s2">do agree with them and endorse them the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.160" end="00:36:38.930" style="s2">idea that you must say so it is is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.119" end="00:36:44.390" style="s2">not on it it crosses a line into a dark</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.930" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">place that does not bode well for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.390" end="00:36:49.400" style="s2">future or freedom of speech in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">country yes go ahead win so who is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.400" end="00:36:56.630" style="s2">professional conduct for lawyers already</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:58.010" style="s2">have a rule that requires us to act you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.630" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">know in in accordance with the Human</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.010" end="00:37:03.710" style="s2">Rights Code and and principles of not to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:05.750" style="s2">discriminate I guess is the word I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.710" end="00:37:08.900" style="s2">using and so clearly our actions are</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.750" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">already governed by a code of conduct</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.900" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">and and by the legislation generally so</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:15.319" style="s2">for them to to request the statement of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.869" style="s2">principles it really is just asking you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.319" end="00:37:21.560" style="s2">to the way you think and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.869" end="00:37:23.390" style="s2">like it&#39;s not like this is needed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.560" end="00:37:27.020" style="s2">like it&#39;s the distinction between your</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.390" end="00:37:28.790" style="s2">obligation to comply with the law and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.020" end="00:37:30.319" style="s2">state that you agree with the law which</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.790" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">again going back to the Supreme Court of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.319" end="00:37:34.849" style="s2">Canada is there are two quite different</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:37.930" style="s2">things I think and I read again what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.849" end="00:37:37.930" style="s2">Supreme Court said on this question</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.680" end="00:37:44.450" style="s2">Supreme Court says this however</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.450" end="00:37:48.109" style="s2">admirable the objectives and provisions</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:50.780" style="s2">of the law maybe no one is obliged to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.109" end="00:37:54.170" style="s2">approve of them anyone may criticize</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.780" end="00:37:54.790" style="s2">them and seek to have them amended or</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.170" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">repealed</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.790" end="00:37:59.960" style="s2">although complying with them so long as</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:01.880" style="s2">there are ineffective so this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.960" end="00:38:03.800" style="s2">question of whether lawyers are subject</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.880" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">to human rights code and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.800" end="00:38:07.819" style="s2">anti-discrimination laws that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:09.349" style="s2">not the question here the question is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.819" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">whether or not you are required to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.349" end="00:38:13.910" style="s2">endorse them and say that you agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:15.560" style="s2">which is quite a different thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">the other thing that disturbs me about</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.560" end="00:38:21.800" style="s2">this and I suppose this is a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:24.520" style="s2">of my experience with delving deeply</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.800" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">into the history of places like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.520" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">Soviet Union in its early stages of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.950" style="s2">development is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">class-based guilt phenomena that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.950" end="00:38:36.290" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s lurking at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:39.109" style="s2">this to which is also absolutely I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.290" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">say terrifying so let&#39;s just say for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.109" end="00:38:45.079" style="s2">moment although I don&#39;t believe this</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:19.310" style="s2">all guilty of all sorts of terrible</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.390" end="00:40:21.110" style="s2">things all the time and that puts us</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.110" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">want to make those guilt bait those</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.120" end="00:40:40.700" style="s2">there there is no one that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:42.830" style="s2">identify who in terms of group</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.830" end="00:40:49.370" style="s2">as well I mean this is also a casting</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.580" end="00:40:52.130" style="s2">than that back into history deceived</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.370" end="00:40:54.410" style="s2">know which group did wrong to to which</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.130" end="00:40:57.290" style="s2">group but of course there there is no on</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.720" end="00:41:09.860" style="s2">Hartley&#39;s the criteria for guilt that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.460" end="00:41:11.390" style="s2">you have said then everybody is guilty</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.860" end="00:41:14.510" style="s2">and the whole thing starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.390" end="00:41:16.730" style="s2">silver yes everyone&#39;s guilty that means</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.510" end="00:41:21.830" style="s2">that the people who hold the right to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.730" end="00:41:23.840" style="s2">punishment become all-powerful yes at</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.830" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">least in Soviet Russia they they prime</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.840" end="00:41:26.690" style="s2">you up and torture you a bit before they</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.210" style="s2">had you swear your statement of</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.210" end="00:41:39.410" style="s2">will I thought I might do is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.910" end="00:41:42.590" style="s2">to put together an anonymous list so</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.410" end="00:41:47.510" style="s2">that lawyers who are willing to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.590" end="00:41:50.030" style="s2">their objections to this requirement can</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.510" end="00:41:52.370" style="s2">sign up and that way I can tweet and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.030" end="00:41:55.910" style="s2">also stay in contact with you guys on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.370" end="00:41:57.800" style="s2">regular basis how many signatories I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">obtained and I won&#39;t make that public</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.800" end="00:42:04.360" style="s2">I&#39;ll make sure that it&#39;s not crackable</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:07.580" style="s2">and that way it&#39;ll help people</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.360" end="00:42:10.340" style="s2">discover how many other people are also</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.580" end="00:42:12.530" style="s2">concerned about this and indicate to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.340" end="00:42:15.050" style="s2">what degree there might be strength in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.530" end="00:42:16.820" style="s2">numbers and so I&#39;ll set that up very</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.050" end="00:42:18.830" style="s2">carefully and I&#39;ll put the link to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.820" end="00:42:22.270" style="s2">in the description of this video and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.830" end="00:42:28.450" style="s2">I guess we&#39;ve decided on three potential</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.270" end="00:42:31.160" style="s2">modes of action and Jarrod&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.450" end="00:42:33.650" style="s2">suggestion if I remember correctly was</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.160" end="00:42:36.250" style="s2">to not file the statement of principle</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.650" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">and also write a letter indicating</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.250" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">precisely why and I guess that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:47.360" style="s2">I think it might be most effective if</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">you file the piece of paper as your</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.360" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">statements but don&#39;t make it a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:54.920" style="s2">statements just say on the statement of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:57.260" style="s2">principles that you object to filing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.920" end="00:42:58.370" style="s2">statement of principles or if they show</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.260" end="00:43:00.410" style="s2">that suggested in the column they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.370" end="00:43:01.460" style="s2">more than welcome to send in a copy of</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.070" end="00:43:11.510" style="s2">just forgotten but there is a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.320" end="00:43:12.950" style="s2">paper that is filed in place of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.510" end="00:43:14.570" style="s2">they&#39;ve asked for but it is not what</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.950" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve asked for okay so that can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.570" end="00:43:17.720" style="s2">very straightforward that means that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:20.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily be very</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.720" end="00:43:23.630" style="s2">time-consuming you could you could take</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.690" end="00:43:27.260" style="s2">the time to delineate why you&#39;re opposed</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.630" end="00:43:30.050" style="s2">to this or yes or you could just state</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.260" end="00:43:31.970" style="s2">that you&#39;re opposed to this yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.050" end="00:43:34.660" style="s2">think they should go to great lengths if</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.970" end="00:43:38.300" style="s2">it&#39;s very simple if they just say</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:41.960" style="s2">something like this is for speech and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.300" end="00:43:44.090" style="s2">choose not to comply or send in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.960" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">column or something something that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.090" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">stands for the proposition that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.530" style="s2">declining this request they can be very</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">sure it does not have to be a full</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.530" end="00:43:58.820" style="s2">reasoned giant object yeah most lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.790" style="s2">know how to do that if they&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.820" end="00:44:02.990" style="s2">courtroom yes that&#39;s right it should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.790" end="00:44:05.120" style="s2">it should be something they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.990" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">accustomed to doing and so and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.120" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">put up this late for the list so that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:12.770" style="s2">can start to collect signatories and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:15.230" style="s2">decide who and let people know how many</p>
