<p begin="00:00:03.140" end="00:00:05.760" style="s2">I am no longer an atheist.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.040" end="00:00:08.220" style="s2"> Because I no longer see the world this way.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.660" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2"> I am not a materialist (philosophical doctrine) anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.100" end="00:00:13.680" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think the world is made of matter.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.760" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2"> I believe the world is made of what matters.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.120" end="00:00:17.500" style="s2"> It is made of meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.620" end="00:00:21.040" style="s2"> Look at it from the point of view of modern neuroscience.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.200" end="00:00:24.040" style="s2"> Look at what we&#39;re heading to, subconsciously.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.040" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2"> In other words, what attracts our attention. It is the meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.420" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2"> The meaning that grabs our attention before we know what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.580" end="00:00:33.620" style="s2"> The brain behaves as if the world is made of information or meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:36.740" style="s2"> Heidegger, for example, is a German philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.000" end="00:00:40.840" style="s2"> He was convinced that the world was essentially made of meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.080" end="00:00:46.340" style="s2"> And people&#39;s primary interaction with existence was the interaction with meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.840" end="00:00:51.140" style="s2"> This is not what modern humans believe, being too materialistic.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.280" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2"> If you went past 400 or 500 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:56.380" style="s2"> And I understood what people mean when they say &quot;substance&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.640" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2"> It is what makes everything -</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.780" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2"> You will see that what they think about the meaning of the material is not what we think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2"> Their definition of matter was not in this physical form; The kind of dirt that everything is made of.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:10.700" style="s2"> The definition was more complicated than this.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.060" end="00:01:13.820" style="s2"> The problem with the normal perception of matter is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.820" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2"> It does not address the fact that matter appears in the form of arrays and patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.940" end="00:01:22.780" style="s2"> These shapes are lost if matter is thought of as atoms.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.180" end="00:01:26.360" style="s2"> And that this is the entirety of reality, and that this is the entirety of the interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.920" end="00:01:28.540" style="s2"> &quot;in the beginning&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.900" end="00:01:32.580" style="s2"> God created Adam and Eve in his image and likeness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:37.800" style="s2"> There are many interpretations of the first creature created by God.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.800" end="00:01:43.260" style="s2"> There is a tradition in medieval Christianity and Judaism that:</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.400" end="00:01:48.220" style="s2"> The first human being was a bisexual: male and female together.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2"> They were separated and made in the constant hope of being together.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:58.300" style="s2"> There is a deep psychological idea here that states:</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.460" end="00:02:04.580" style="s2"> The union of male and female is the product of a perfect kidney.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.780" end="00:02:07.640" style="s2"> And this can be expressed biologically.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.720" end="00:02:11.740" style="s2"> We know that the male needs the female and that masculinity needs femininity.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.900" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2"> You can think of it as different aspects of the psyche.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.040" end="00:02:20.300" style="s2"> Or between people and different aspects of the psyche that exist within people.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.620" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2"> So whatever consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:26.020" style="s2"> It comes in the male and female embodiment.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2"> Both incarnations are equal representations of God.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:33.100" style="s2"> Which I think is important.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.100" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2"> Because there is that endless criticism of feminism</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2"> Western tradition is based on the assumption that the entire temple is masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.960" end="00:02:41.960" style="s2"> And I don&#39;t think this is true.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:46.900" style="s2"> Because if he were masculine, the man would have been created in the image of God.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2"> And he is clearly wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.940" end="00:02:54.360" style="s2"> Masculinity and femininity, in addition to their expression of sexual identity,</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:02:56.540" style="s2"> Expressive ratings.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.860" end="00:03:03.100" style="s2"> The expressive female classification is the birthplace of things. uterus.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.420" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2"> The female is associated with the essential aspect of an efficient production process.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.320" end="00:03:13.660" style="s2"> It is from the female that new shapes come out.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.740" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2"> For example: New forms emerge from what you do not understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2"> This is the womb of existence.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:24.880" style="s2"> New biological forms emerging from a female substrate; Any females.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:33.080" style="s2"> The male side is more creative, symbolically speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2"> The idea of ​​creativity is the trigger.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2"> The idea also expresses in mythology logical clarity and cut.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:47.140" style="s2"> While femininity expresses something complete and undifferentiated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:51.660" style="s2"> There are those who believe that in the story of Adam and Eve that the woman is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.660" end="00:03:53.560" style="s2"> The first participant of the food.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.560" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2"> I think this is related in some way to her ability to make Adam conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.420" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2"> Which you actually do!</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2"> I gave him something that made him conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.420" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2"> What made her aware of herself as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.400" end="00:04:09.400" style="s2"> Women make men conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.860" end="00:04:12.700" style="s2"> You cannot find a truer truth than this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.180" style="s2"> This is a result of their being selective and also their rejection of most men.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.420" end="00:04:18.860" style="s2"> &quot;Shame on Adam&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.300" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2"> God appeared and was looking for Adam; He used to walk around with him,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2"> And Adam was hiding behind the bushes.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:27.320" style="s2"> Which indicates the low level of intelligence of Adam.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.420" end="00:04:30.120" style="s2"> you know; God sees through the bushes.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:33.260" style="s2"> But it also indicates his level of self-awareness.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2"> It means that when Adam became aware of himself</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.900" end="00:04:42.840" style="s2"> He no longer believed in the fact that he was in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.940" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2"> Enough to give him status.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.540" end="00:04:47.880" style="s2"> God said to him: &quot;Whoever teach you that you are naked.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2"> Really here is the fall of Adam.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:54.360" style="s2"> Adam said it was the woman and her mother.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.360" end="00:04:56.140" style="s2"> And it is really satisfying.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.820" end="00:04:59.300" style="s2"> &quot;The woman you brought with me is she gave me&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.300" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2"> Yes, I made you self-conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:02.500" style="s2"> Hurrah. I knew you woke up.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2"> There is something to be said about this.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2"> The woman tortures the man in order to wake him up.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.420" end="00:05:08.420" style="s2"> And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s always grateful.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2"> &#39;Paradise lost&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2"> John Milton wrote Paradise Lost for two reasons:</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2"> The first is to justify God&#39;s ways to people.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:27.640" style="s2"> The second reason for his writings is the arrangement of mythology stories that were marginal to ecclesiastical Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2"> In one coherent narrative.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:33.460" style="s2"> Here is a question he tried to answer:</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.740" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2"> If God was all-knowing, why did he create Adam and Eve despite knowing their fall?</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.720" style="s2"> Milton has a complex response to this question;</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.120" end="00:05:46.120" style="s2"> Man has free will.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2"> Even if God knows the fall of man,</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.680" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2"> There was nothing to do except</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2"> Take their free will.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.500" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2"> But freedom of will was so important that its taking could not happen.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2"> Dostoevsky points out that freedom is extremely important to people.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.100" end="00:06:08.100" style="s2"> Even arbitrary freedoms.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:13.180" style="s2"> People want freedom even if it is chased by disasters. People hate the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.180" end="00:06:16.540" style="s2"> They are willing to sacrifice anything for freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.540" end="00:06:19.880" style="s2"> God’s judgment was: Freedom is better than protection.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.220" end="00:06:21.060" style="s2"> &quot;Why a snake?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.100" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2"> The snake in the Garden of Eden is an important character</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:28.340" style="s2"> Humans and chimpanzees, the closest biological species,</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.700" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2"> They are naturally feared and attracted to reptiles.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.760" end="00:06:37.240" style="s2"> Where an area of ​​the brain called the amygdala is involuntarily activated.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.560" end="00:06:39.880" style="s2"> That has to do with stress.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.100" end="00:06:49.080" style="s2"> I think the evolutionary reason for this is that mammals and reptiles kept at war during an environmental race</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2"> For about 60 to 200 million years.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.740" end="00:06:56.980" style="s2"> Cold-blooded reptile qualities,</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2"> Pierced eyes, pointed teeth, and night walks.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.620" style="s2"> Located outside, where the unknown is. Where there is chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.020" end="00:07:10.380" style="s2"> The snake is kind of a symbol of the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.940" end="00:07:12.940" style="s2"> And it is a contradictory adjective</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.940" end="00:07:15.820" style="s2"> You use it in mythology, for example:</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.820" end="00:07:17.820" style="s2"> Dragon in Western Culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.960" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2"> It is a negative thing, but in Chinese culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2"> It is a positive thing.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:25.420" style="s2"> The unknown is like a dragon here, it is negative and positive.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.420" end="00:07:27.420" style="s2"> The snake in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.420" end="00:07:30.520" style="s2"> It is a symbol of all those things that appear</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.520" end="00:07:33.260" style="s2"> When you think you know what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.260" end="00:07:35.260" style="s2"> And when you think that you are aware of what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.260" end="00:07:38.600" style="s2"> You are that little heaven in which you live.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.600" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2"> But there will still be something coming out for you. And it&#39;s those things that you don&#39;t care about.</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.180" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2"> It&#39;s the snake. And when this snake appears, we panic.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2"> When a snake appears we want to stay away from it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2"> But we are still curious, wanting to check it out.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2"> When a chimpanzee collides with a snake in the woods, it triggers a distinct cry.</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:01.720" style="s2"> She claims the wrath of the snake.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.720" end="00:08:04.920" style="s2"> And chimpanzees, which do not like snakes, do not run away from snakes</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.920" end="00:08:07.080" style="s2"> Rather, it goes back and monitors it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.080" end="00:08:10.100" style="s2"> They do not take their eyes off the object.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.100" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2"> Some of them are staring for ten minutes. Some are staring for hours.</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:18.760" style="s2"> The unknown is wonderful! We cannot take our eyes off him.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.760" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2"> We must confront him even if he is terrifying.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2"> It is one of the reasons teenagers are so popular with horror movies.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.420" style="s2"> They are driven by the desire to watch the snake.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.420" end="00:08:29.420" style="s2"> They want to deal with the snake.</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.920" end="00:08:34.840" style="s2"> In Genesis, of course, dealing with a serpent was the end of bliss.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.840" end="00:08:36.840" style="s2"> Just as it happens in reality.</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.840" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2"> There are some beliefs that the serpent in Eden was Satan trying to destroy God&#39;s work.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:45.880" style="s2"> People often look at their past and say:</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.880" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2"> Do you know? I was expelled from my paradise because of that event.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:53.380" style="s2"> But looking at it again, it made me more mature.</p>
