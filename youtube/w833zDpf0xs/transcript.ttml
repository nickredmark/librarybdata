<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.250" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">okay all right so welcome to the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.029" end="00:00:34.640" style="s2">this is the mediation campfire usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:38.449" style="s2">hosted by myself and Jason and often</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.640" end="00:00:44.019" style="s2">also accompanied by by Peter for those</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.449" end="00:00:49.339" style="s2">of you who don&#39;t have the background on</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.019" end="00:00:51.379" style="s2">what the the frame of this this regular</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.339" end="00:00:53.690" style="s2">meetup is I&#39;ll give a quick little</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.379" end="00:00:57.710" style="s2">description but we also should have</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.690" end="00:00:59.479" style="s2">descriptions on the website and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.710" end="00:01:05.930" style="s2">that we&#39;ve also I think that Peter has</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.479" end="00:01:08.180" style="s2">also hosted a document or link to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.930" end="00:01:11.960" style="s2">document that kind of has a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.180" end="00:01:15.110" style="s2">information phrases and definitions for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.960" end="00:01:19.690" style="s2">what media mimetic mediation is but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.110" end="00:01:24.050" style="s2">was basically a phrase coined in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.690" end="00:01:29.270" style="s2">culture war 2.0 paper that Peter and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.050" end="00:01:31.330" style="s2">Colin or Peter in Connor Barnes written</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.270" end="00:01:34.340" style="s2">and published that we got really popular</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.330" end="00:01:36.110" style="s2">and the way that you know we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.340" end="00:01:42.080" style="s2">a go any kind of solid definition on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.110" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">but Jason and I prefer to like very</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.080" end="00:01:48.050" style="s2">quickly summarize it as the medic</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">mediation being what happens in between</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.050" end="00:01:53.960" style="s2">the tribes so kind of the connective</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:56.840" style="s2">tissue so that we are sharing insights</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.960" end="00:02:00.620" style="s2">seeing each other and benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.840" end="00:02:03.620" style="s2">all the plurality of perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.620" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">we have and ideologies and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.620" end="00:02:10.670" style="s2">philosophies and spiritualities and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.860" end="00:02:13.099" style="s2">whatnot so yeah I like this space in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.670" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">between metaphor because it does give us</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.099" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">a little bit of it just genuinely has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:22.760" style="s2">different orientation than any existing</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:24.250" style="s2">tribe it&#39;s the tribe with no barriers or</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.760" end="00:02:25.690" style="s2">no boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.250" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">and I like that it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.690" end="00:02:31.600" style="s2">provocative image</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">I was thinking earlier this morning</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.600" end="00:02:42.670" style="s2">about what I might speak to I do have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:46.690" style="s2">a a specific frame that I could bring to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.670" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">this and it&#39;s actually kind of centers</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.690" end="00:02:58.209" style="s2">around the role of order and chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">this whole space if yeah I mean I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.209" end="00:03:02.410" style="s2">I could go there it&#39;s a bit you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.270" style="s2">ordering chaos is what it would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.410" end="00:03:07.209" style="s2">framed I think especially from kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.270" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">Western philosophical play space but if</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.209" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at it from a you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">something more Eastern like a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:14.320" style="s2">lens this would be the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:16.990" style="s2">between form and emptiness or emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.320" end="00:03:19.240" style="s2">and or openness I like a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.990" end="00:03:20.770" style="s2">better of a translation and I see these</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.240" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">dynamics is like kind of essential to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.770" end="00:03:26.350" style="s2">the whole inner workings but that being</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:28.570" style="s2">said before I dive in I was also</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.350" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">wondering maybe if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.570" end="00:03:34.420" style="s2">specific that anybody wants to hit on</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">and I might be able to kind of tie that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.420" end="00:03:38.170" style="s2">into some of my opening thoughts before</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">we&#39;re off to the races because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.170" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">majority of this I&#39;d like to just be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">kind of group exploration last time we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">started a very ground level within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:54.519" style="s2">individual kind of felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">embodying this mediation rule the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.519" end="00:03:58.330" style="s2">before that it was a lot more high-level</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.600" end="00:04:00.310" style="s2">we were talking about different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.330" end="00:04:02.680" style="s2">memetic tribal wars and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.310" end="00:04:05.380" style="s2">and ended up slowly kind of working our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.680" end="00:04:07.930" style="s2">way down a little bit more into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.380" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">individual level but was wondering you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.930" end="00:04:13.750" style="s2">know anybody come here looking for or</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">you know a certain certain lens a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.750" end="00:04:19.269" style="s2">certain angle questions that that seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:22.450" style="s2">very very unknown or you know very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.269" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">alive in your experience when talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.450" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">about thematic radiation</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.260" end="00:04:36.830" style="s2">can I ask something yeah first hi i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.820" end="00:04:42.110" style="s2">i&#39;m ryan it&#39;s my first time joining the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.830" end="00:04:45.560" style="s2">group and nice nice to meet everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.110" end="00:04:49.010" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really understand like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.560" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">nomadic mediation like what like where</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.010" end="00:04:52.730" style="s2">are people doing the mediations</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:56.330" style="s2">basically I wasn&#39;t sure what platform or</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.730" end="00:04:58.070" style="s2">form it took uh sorry if this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.330" end="00:04:59.870" style="s2">inappropriate or like off the rail or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.070" end="00:05:01.160" style="s2">whatever but I kind of I asked some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.870" end="00:05:02.510" style="s2">the questions on the slack group and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.160" end="00:05:04.820" style="s2">never received an answer so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.510" end="00:05:06.470" style="s2">want to show up and ask like um like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.820" end="00:05:09.170" style="s2">world the mediations actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.470" end="00:05:11.000" style="s2">like I I&#39;m a mediator and I work for an</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.170" end="00:05:13.160" style="s2">organization police natural mediation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">Gresham Oregon and that&#39;s kind of my set</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.160" end="00:05:19.250" style="s2">up but I was curious for other well is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">it for other people mmm I mean I could</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.250" end="00:05:25.640" style="s2">guess I&#39;d love to you know speak about</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">from my perspective on it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.640" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">Jason and I are a little bit more a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">oriented toward this in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:37.250" style="s2">we see or a mediation mediation as being</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:40.100" style="s2">kind of a general orientation or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.250" end="00:05:43.370" style="s2">perspective to bring to any and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.100" end="00:05:46.190" style="s2">conversations that were thrown into you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.370" end="00:05:49.370" style="s2">know so Jason and I have a podcast where</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.190" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">the the two of us co-host and and have</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.370" end="00:05:54.440" style="s2">guests on and and we kind of always kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">of keep this the spirit of the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:05:59.570" style="s2">mediation in the background or as a core</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">intention but it&#39;s not extremely</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.570" end="00:06:05.450" style="s2">explicit or well you know we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:08.060" style="s2">any kind of specific psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.450" end="00:06:12.050" style="s2">or frameworks that were regularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.060" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">employing I do know that Peter on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.050" end="00:06:19.450" style="s2">other hand seems to be exploring what</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.430" end="00:06:22.760" style="s2">mimetic mediation would look like for</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.450" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">specific conversation modalities so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.760" end="00:06:31.730" style="s2">might be circling practices or emotional</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:34.010" style="s2">what it was there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.730" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">different conversation modalities that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.010" end="00:06:38.840" style="s2">like kind of are very well structured</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:40.610" style="s2">you know restating somebody what</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.840" end="00:06:41.910" style="s2">somebody&#39;s perspective that were not</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.610" end="00:06:43.050" style="s2">familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.910" end="00:06:45.150" style="s2">making sure that both of you agreed</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.050" end="00:06:46.830" style="s2">before you move forward and so I know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.150" end="00:06:48.270" style="s2">he&#39;s played a little bit more with like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.830" end="00:06:51.810" style="s2">the structure that we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.270" end="00:06:53.490" style="s2">create and and part of what we see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.810" end="00:06:56.760" style="s2">convert these conversations these weekly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.490" end="00:06:59.250" style="s2">conversations as being is like finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.760" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">opportunities to find places to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.250" end="00:07:05.760" style="s2">mediation and so so yeah and because</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s so the phrase itself is so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.760" end="00:07:09.900" style="s2">nebulous Jason and I haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:11.670" style="s2">anything very structured with it but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.900" end="00:07:15.030" style="s2">yeah rather see it it&#39;s just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.670" end="00:07:17.130" style="s2">core intention and but yeah and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.030" end="00:07:19.830" style="s2">love to also figure out how you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.130" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">maybe the future sessions like this we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.830" end="00:07:24.750" style="s2">invite you know some people who have</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:26.280" style="s2">genuine different genuinely different</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.750" end="00:07:29.100" style="s2">perspectives and try and figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.280" end="00:07:31.200" style="s2">how to host that and and create a space</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.100" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">that allows the mediation to arise in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.200" end="00:07:36.540" style="s2">those conversations as well so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:39.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that completely answers</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.540" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">the question but that&#39;s my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.090" end="00:07:50.040" style="s2">at least and ads and stuff yeah so so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:52.050" style="s2">and if my perspective comes from where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.040" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">am in life so I am an Orthodox Jew</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.050" end="00:07:58.320" style="s2">living in Israel and for me what</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:00.900" style="s2">medication kinda means is that when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.320" end="00:08:04.230" style="s2">employ in different situations so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.900" end="00:08:06.930" style="s2">represent different populations so um</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.230" end="00:08:08.640" style="s2">Peter and the food also have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:10.950" style="s2">article called the marginal figure which</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.640" end="00:08:12.510" style="s2">I kind of I think I do actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.950" end="00:08:13.560" style="s2">recognize myself as being that which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.510" end="00:08:16.860" style="s2">kind of a person who goes in between</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">different cultures and groups so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.860" end="00:08:21.410" style="s2">that kind of means is that so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:23.340" style="s2">here right in this very multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.410" end="00:08:25.890" style="s2">environment so I feel that much like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.340" end="00:08:30.150" style="s2">representative of my tribe which is kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.890" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">of a relatively conservative traditional</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">community very religious also Jewish I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">live in Israel so I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:38.580" style="s2">Zionism exactly identify with that fake</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">complex for me but definitely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.580" end="00:08:42.780" style="s2">part of what I represent at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">towards other people and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.780" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">bringing my own perspective here to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:48.840" style="s2">multicultural group and also in Israel</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:52.170" style="s2">so I&#39;m in the features college and I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.840" end="00:08:53.520" style="s2">in part of program that has multiple all</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.170" end="00:08:55.560" style="s2">different teachers colleges in Israel</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.520" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">together so their secular religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.560" end="00:09:00.210" style="s2">some of them are Arab colleges they</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:02.520" style="s2">speak in Arabic and they&#39;re so they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.520" end="00:09:08.730" style="s2">and so as bringing the perspective of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">medic mediator when these meetups come</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.730" end="00:09:14.520" style="s2">up I tried it I kind of see a drive to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">bring the conversation away just from</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.520" end="00:09:18.839" style="s2">strictly education and also try to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:21.300" style="s2">people bring up their perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.839" end="00:09:22.970" style="s2">what&#39;s going deep inside them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.300" end="00:09:25.380" style="s2">addressing the elephant in the room and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.970" end="00:09:26.970" style="s2">almost raising the conflict that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.380" end="00:09:30.330" style="s2">could be addressed and having people</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.970" end="00:09:31.620" style="s2">exposed to the perspectives that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.330" end="00:09:33.779" style="s2">want to be spoken about keep speaking</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">about pedagogy instead of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.779" end="00:09:41.310" style="s2">how people feel regarding everything so</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:44.460" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how I kind of see it as</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.310" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">trying to have people to express their</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.460" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">culture and where they&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:49.620" style="s2">and kind of bring me to the table and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:52.520" style="s2">say that&#39;s my role because I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.620" end="00:09:52.520" style="s2">in that position anytime</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.840" end="00:09:59.700" style="s2">I love it yeah and I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">people have been on a number of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.700" end="00:10:04.680" style="s2">calls so if anybody else feels inclined</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:07.530" style="s2">to yeah there&#39;s no right answer here of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.680" end="00:10:09.330" style="s2">what medic mediation is so if it means</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.530" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">something to you I&#39;d love to hear more</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.330" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">but the personal reflections I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">personal reflection last night I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:20.370" style="s2">sitting around the campfire with my</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:22.890" style="s2">family and so I saw like my Nana and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.370" end="00:10:25.410" style="s2">Papa who I haven&#39;t seen in well over a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.890" end="00:10:26.820" style="s2">month and so they were like ready they</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:28.170" style="s2">find they&#39;re like okay guys come for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.820" end="00:10:30.150" style="s2">fire like we&#39;ll have a social distance</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.170" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">campfire it&#39;ll be okay because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.150" end="00:10:34.530" style="s2">been pretty conservative and protecting</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:37.290" style="s2">themselves so we went out there and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.530" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">I had an uncle there and my parents were</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.290" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">there and I noticed people were sharing</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">things that they had been hearing like</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:48.180" style="s2">conspiracy theories and other like</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:50.040" style="s2">political narratives and things that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.180" end="00:10:52.380" style="s2">would never have expected them to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.040" end="00:10:54.810" style="s2">been exposed to and all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.380" end="00:10:57.390" style="s2">had this scent like this sense that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.810" end="00:10:58.830" style="s2">realization that even these my</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.390" end="00:11:00.960" style="s2">grandparents I thought were not</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.830" end="00:11:02.820" style="s2">susceptible to like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.960" end="00:11:04.500" style="s2">different things meaning like I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.820" end="00:11:06.510" style="s2">don&#39;t see them their tribe is just their</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.500" end="00:11:08.400" style="s2">family and like their neighbors and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.510" end="00:11:10.970" style="s2">people they work with but now all of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.400" end="00:11:14.460" style="s2">sudden I see how there&#39;s these other</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.970" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">mimetic tribes that they can find and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.460" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">then lean into and so that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">find this being like most relevant to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:25.110" style="s2">is like sitting around my family and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:26.550" style="s2">of these contradicting ideas and things</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.110" end="00:11:28.950" style="s2">come up and you feel a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.550" end="00:11:31.350" style="s2">heating up and I&#39;m just like how this</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.950" end="00:11:33.000" style="s2">temptation to share all of my opinions</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:35.310" style="s2">but I&#39;m like no like I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.000" end="00:11:39.270" style="s2">that here like what is the way for me to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.310" end="00:11:44.070" style="s2">be to just to love my family the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.270" end="00:11:46.050" style="s2">actually and so yeah and really for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.070" end="00:11:49.560" style="s2">it feels like I&#39;m just mediating between</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.050" end="00:11:54.120" style="s2">myself and my own triggered responses</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.560" end="00:12:00.030" style="s2">and my family so that&#39;s um yeah one way</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.120" end="00:12:02.460" style="s2">this is really relevant for me yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.030" end="00:12:06.870" style="s2">will say I mean this is a good reminder</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.460" end="00:12:11.460" style="s2">to the the reason we chose the medic or</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.870" end="00:12:14.790" style="s2">campfire is because we expect the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.460" end="00:12:17.190" style="s2">dialogue to kind of embody that or Oreo</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.790" end="00:12:19.050" style="s2">strive to embody that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.190" end="00:12:22.140" style="s2">orientation right these these campfires</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.050" end="00:12:25.380" style="s2">like there&#39;s such a kind of closeness a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.140" end="00:12:27.270" style="s2">shared aspect to them a warmth like</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.380" end="00:12:29.670" style="s2">everybody&#39;s kind of huddled around kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.270" end="00:12:32.070" style="s2">of enjoying the same source of warmth so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.670" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just like this conviviality is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.070" end="00:12:36.330" style="s2">kind of inherent in what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:40.680" style="s2">at a campfire and that very much is kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.330" end="00:12:42.930" style="s2">of one of the core metaphors or lenses</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.680" end="00:12:45.990" style="s2">that we kind of see these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.930" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">taking as well so another thing to kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.990" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">of be aware as now yeah just this kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:13:00.380" style="s2">of just human human to human very primal</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:13:00.380" style="s2">kind of perspective sharing the fire</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.570" end="00:13:06.839" style="s2">here I know that you had your mic</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.980" end="00:13:10.620" style="s2">unmuted for a second could I could I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.839" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">call on you yeah I well I was just going</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.620" end="00:13:14.610" style="s2">to say I could relate I think I shared</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:16.760" style="s2">in the chat I can relate to both what</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.610" end="00:13:19.980" style="s2">Benjamin shared and what Tyler shared of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.760" end="00:13:24.900" style="s2">you know being someone who can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.980" end="00:13:30.270" style="s2">exist between tribes and you know has</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.900" end="00:13:34.440" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s like and then wanting</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.440" end="00:13:39.270" style="s2">when it comes to being able to sit with</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:42.510" style="s2">the discomfort that comes from conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.270" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">with family like my husband and I are in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.510" end="00:13:46.740" style="s2">a discussion right now about gun control</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:50.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s that there&#39;s a lot of feelings</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.740" end="00:13:53.730" style="s2">around that and so like just being able</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.910" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">instantaneous get reaction of well</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.860" end="00:15:02.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just stupid which can you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten there and I don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.080" end="00:15:05.770" style="s2">one but there&#39;s other ones and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">curious for the for the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.770" end="00:15:10.360" style="s2">group how they how they work with those</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">that that you know those strong</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">reactions that come up</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.100" end="00:15:21.160" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.860" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">I think sometimes these things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.829" end="00:15:30.200" style="s2">really easy to talk about in theory and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">when you&#39;re in the moment we all default</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:42.940" style="s2">to you know the fighter flight or freeze</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:47.779" style="s2">I believe that any time we can reflect</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.940" end="00:15:50.269" style="s2">physiological sensation and say I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.779" end="00:15:52.579" style="s2">it sounds kind of cheesy but I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.269" end="00:15:56.350" style="s2">that if we&#39;re grounding it and they here</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.579" end="00:15:59.149" style="s2">and now and your relation to the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.350" end="00:16:02.180" style="s2">space and time that you&#39;re holding with</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.149" end="00:16:05.300" style="s2">someone you say you know what you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.180" end="00:16:09.110" style="s2">kind of makes my stomach kind of jittery</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.300" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">or my heart just jumped a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.110" end="00:16:14.149" style="s2">palpitations and I think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:16.700" style="s2">you stated such such and such and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.149" end="00:16:19.760" style="s2">believe this way those are some ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.700" end="00:16:27.560" style="s2">that I&#39;ve kind of dealt with those</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.760" end="00:16:29.750" style="s2">situations just because it kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.560" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">takes some of the edge off of what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.750" end="00:16:44.899" style="s2">have to say your response so definitely</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:50.180" style="s2">these are the very difficult situations</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.899" end="00:16:55.790" style="s2">but sometimes what I try to do is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.180" end="00:16:58.730" style="s2">if what someone said is very even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.790" end="00:17:05.150" style="s2">it&#39;s very outrageous I guess being human</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:09.530" style="s2">we do get reactions but if we try to ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.150" end="00:17:12.589" style="s2">them questions like why they said this</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.530" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">and where they&#39;re going from maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.589" end="00:17:17.329" style="s2">can understand their view of the truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">because I believe that everyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.329" end="00:17:28.390" style="s2">different view reality that&#39;s how I try</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:28.390" style="s2">to do it very unsuccessfully</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.890" end="00:17:47.799" style="s2">I would add kind of one thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.290" end="00:17:49.270" style="s2">I think is you know we&#39;ve in some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.799" end="00:17:51.429" style="s2">these previous conversations we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.270" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">lot about how like getting in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.429" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">the felt sense is important and doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:17:57.309" style="s2">the decoupling from the ideas is also</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:00.970" style="s2">important because the idea is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.309" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">they kind of justify the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:07.240" style="s2">reaction and then another component here</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:09.250" style="s2">too is we I think we even used it or use</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.240" end="00:18:11.500" style="s2">the phrase of kind of getting caught up</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.250" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">or constricted into that response you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.500" end="00:18:15.490" style="s2">know it&#39;s like we feel like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">other way to react other than some sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.490" end="00:18:21.130" style="s2">of you know fight flight or response or</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:23.770" style="s2">or freeze one of the things that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.130" end="00:18:25.330" style="s2">of interesting or a move here and kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.770" end="00:18:31.750" style="s2">of bringing up the space in between</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.330" end="00:18:35.400" style="s2">again is that emotions have so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.750" end="00:18:35.400" style="s2">harder they have such a harder time</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:41.559" style="s2">evolving or processing or dissipating if</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.260" style="s2">there&#39;s no space for them to dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.559" end="00:18:45.549" style="s2">into and so sometimes like the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.260" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">simple thing and I think this is even</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.549" end="00:18:51.730" style="s2">like a cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:54.610" style="s2">technique is to like literally become</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.730" end="00:18:55.960" style="s2">aware of the room that the space the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.610" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">room that you&#39;re in you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.960" end="00:18:59.110" style="s2">kind of be like up there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">there&#39;s that wall here&#39;s this there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.110" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">empty space in between and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:07.090" style="s2">expanding your cognition does kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">strangely its you know create some space</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.090" end="00:19:12.309" style="s2">around this very solid constricted</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">emotional response and it&#39;s somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.309" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">it tends to dissipate and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:17.890" style="s2">one of the one of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:20.890" style="s2">things is that you can both do this with</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.890" end="00:19:23.559" style="s2">negative and positive emotions and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.890" end="00:19:25.540" style="s2">fascinating thing is that usually I and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:27.700" style="s2">the intention year is important in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.540" end="00:19:30.130" style="s2">sense that if you&#39;re doing it to make it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.700" end="00:19:33.309" style="s2">go away within this agenda of it going</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.130" end="00:19:34.690" style="s2">away probably dangerous territory you</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.309" end="00:19:36.010" style="s2">know you know it&#39;s like telling the kid</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.690" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">not to eat the cookie</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.010" end="00:19:41.230" style="s2">but but if you do it from like just</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:45.190" style="s2">genuinely opening things up and getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.230" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">a sense of the larger picture negative</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.190" end="00:19:48.330" style="s2">emotions tend to kind of dissipate into</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.330" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">they kind of dissolve and positive ones</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">tend to expand which is a quite the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.930" end="00:20:04.380" style="s2">optimistic thing very optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:06.810" style="s2">observation or something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.380" end="00:20:08.220" style="s2">suppose but yeah and you could do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.810" end="00:20:10.230" style="s2">in your own body as well because I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.220" end="00:20:12.630" style="s2">sometimes if your your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.230" end="00:20:14.190" style="s2">reaction is extremely localized you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.630" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">also find another part of your body that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.190" end="00:20:19.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any kind of constriction</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:21.660" style="s2">and notice the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.950" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">two and that creates some space as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.660" end="00:20:27.390" style="s2">but you know the room in space around</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:29.730" style="s2">you I found probably a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.390" end="00:20:34.680" style="s2">accessible because sometimes the body is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.730" end="00:20:42.840" style="s2">just too too excited or something just</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.680" end="00:20:44.490" style="s2">one of the techniques are too abstract</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.840" end="00:20:46.170" style="s2">for me and this could just feel my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.490" end="00:20:47.850" style="s2">personal tendency like I would really</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.170" end="00:20:50.670" style="s2">like to see like you people here have I</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.850" end="00:20:53.160" style="s2">take a severe disagreement got them like</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.670" end="00:20:55.530" style="s2">fleshing it out or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.160" end="00:20:57.060" style="s2">like or me even like a tangible cases</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.530" end="00:20:59.040" style="s2">that people have experience kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.060" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">to see what that would be like because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.040" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s a lot of this abstract</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:06.060" style="s2">talk and for me yeah I guess I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:08.010" style="s2">guess I just avoid conflict most of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.060" end="00:21:09.750" style="s2">time and so I don&#39;t hit it head-on or</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.010" end="00:21:11.670" style="s2">there in situations where it&#39;s fleeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.750" end="00:21:12.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a full-out conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.670" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">kind of would like to see what what</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.900" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">happened nothing she is right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:18.390" style="s2">kind of what happen if you put two</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">people in two different a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.390" end="00:21:22.380" style="s2">tribes just try to like talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.060" style="s2">anything together and like what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.380" end="00:21:25.740" style="s2">happen when people connect would there</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.060" end="00:21:26.850" style="s2">be short wires would it be like oh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.740" end="00:21:29.550" style="s2">just never talked that&#39;s why they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.850" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">get along if they would ever just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.550" end="00:21:32.760" style="s2">things would be fine I&#39;m really in case</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">people have experiences seeing this or</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.760" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">living it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.160" end="00:21:45.480" style="s2">I mean I could try to create a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.680" end="00:21:48.690" style="s2">disagreement if you watch because like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.480" end="00:21:51.060" style="s2">I personally don&#39;t really have a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.690" end="00:21:55.650" style="s2">strong view but so I&#39;m from Karachi</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.060" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">Pakistan and our country so we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.650" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">with visit Israel so Israel is the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:06.990" style="s2">country that is not accepted or like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">don&#39;t consider Israel as a country and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.990" end="00:22:14.190" style="s2">that&#39;s why we cannot get visas and like</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:17.880" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve heard so this is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.190" end="00:22:21.890" style="s2">completely based off media information</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.880" end="00:22:26.040" style="s2">online from what I&#39;ve heard is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.890" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">Israel as a territory is slowly taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.040" end="00:22:35.100" style="s2">over Palestine so all of it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:38.250" style="s2">Palestine before and Israel is doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.100" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">injustice and expanding their territory</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.250" end="00:22:47.400" style="s2">so I would love to hear your views on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:48.630" style="s2">well so I would I&#39;m totally up for this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.400" end="00:22:50.070" style="s2">if other people want to do this right</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.630" end="00:22:52.410" style="s2">now I know this is like cific there you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.070" end="00:22:54.270" style="s2">go wanna go can go very concrete if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.410" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">want to this items do this just two</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.270" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">things one definitely not recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:05.430" style="s2">two I have to say I am like even</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:07.710" style="s2">knowledgeable so much on the topic but</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.430" end="00:23:10.530" style="s2">just from my own I can say what I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.710" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">from from what I know from right road</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.530" end="00:23:14.730" style="s2">so people after that I&#39;m totally open</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:17.010" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to leave it out for some</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.730" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">sort of decision because this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.010" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">little bit different a medic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:24.630" style="s2">kind of bring me to a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:25.710" style="s2">mediation so I say go for it here is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.630" end="00:23:28.490" style="s2">jumping into the deep end of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.710" end="00:23:31.080" style="s2">swimming pool it from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.490" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">might be useful to put in some ground</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.080" end="00:23:37.920" style="s2">rules like if we want to do some mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:40.170" style="s2">mediation when could we intervene maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.920" end="00:23:42.800" style="s2">allow us some space in between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.170" end="00:23:47.000" style="s2">exchange for us to intervene and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.800" end="00:23:47.000" style="s2">translate or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.580" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">yeah well let me it sounds like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.190" end="00:23:57.720" style="s2">pro I&#39;m gonna pause the recording so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">can maybe then restart it after we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.720" end="00:24:01.710" style="s2">done that yeah then this exploring if</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">it&#39;s possible or whatever so I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.710" end="00:24:09.809" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:13.320" style="s2">alright we are back on air so yeah I saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.809" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">Benjamin thanks for taking the plunge</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.320" end="00:24:18.059" style="s2">and you know being being kind of laying</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:20.730" style="s2">yourselves both vulnerable in front of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.059" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">everybody as we watch you foreigner from</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.730" end="00:24:30.660" style="s2">our computers and yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:33.660" style="s2">takes a ton of courage to to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.660" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">things and and you know the the your two</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.660" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">perspectives I think are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">most kind of pronounced versions of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">the you know the the genuine danger in</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:50.910" style="s2">some instances of being able to dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">with people who who come from different</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.910" end="00:24:56.760" style="s2">different perspectives different</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:25:03.480" style="s2">cultural backgrounds and yeah so thank</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.760" end="00:25:05.100" style="s2">you for being quite quite brave one</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.480" end="00:25:09.270" style="s2">thing kind of quick observation I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.100" end="00:25:12.420" style="s2">say you know as Benjamin said wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.270" end="00:25:14.370" style="s2">extremely conflict oriented and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.420" end="00:25:18.780" style="s2">that&#39;s likely due to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.370" end="00:25:20.700" style="s2">you&#39;re at a mediation campfire and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.780" end="00:25:24.600" style="s2">obviously are kind of modeling a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.700" end="00:25:27.270" style="s2">the qualities that I think embody what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.600" end="00:25:30.270" style="s2">mediation is the one that was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.270" end="00:25:32.220" style="s2">most palpable to me was the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.270" end="00:25:36.170" style="s2">when we kind of find ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.220" end="00:25:41.850" style="s2">mediation role it requires us to hold</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.170" end="00:25:45.000" style="s2">multiple perspectives or I like the more</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:48.630" style="s2">general phrase of reference points as we</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.000" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">proceed and and the toughest part about</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.630" end="00:25:53.010" style="s2">that is it it is inherently ambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:55.170" style="s2">because they disagree with each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.010" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">like no two references points can</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.170" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">completely agree and especially when</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:26:01.059" style="s2">we&#39;re in kind of emotionally and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:03.970" style="s2">historically charged space</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.059" end="00:26:05.889" style="s2">so much of what the mediator is doing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.970" end="00:26:09.029" style="s2">kind of like you know they&#39;re their</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.889" end="00:26:13.269" style="s2">burden is is being able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.029" end="00:26:15.009" style="s2">conflicting perspectives in in their in</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.269" end="00:26:16.629" style="s2">their experience and it&#39;s genuinely kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.009" end="00:26:18.370" style="s2">of you know I think it came up a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.629" end="00:26:19.899" style="s2">times like you know I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.370" end="00:26:21.429" style="s2">speak for these all these people because</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.899" end="00:26:23.139" style="s2">because I can&#39;t and and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.429" end="00:26:25.450" style="s2">even know that though you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.139" end="00:26:28.330" style="s2">one of the most essential qualities here</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.450" end="00:26:30.039" style="s2">to know that when considering others we</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.330" end="00:26:33.249" style="s2">can only partially consider them and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.039" end="00:26:36.340" style="s2">can kind of play act and approximate</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.249" end="00:26:39.429" style="s2">their position but but yeah being okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.340" end="00:26:41.769" style="s2">with ambiguity kind of nebulosity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.429" end="00:26:45.940" style="s2">kind of an inherent skill that I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.769" end="00:26:48.669" style="s2">SP Boyd here and and yeah you guys kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.940" end="00:26:50.580" style="s2">of did that amazingly and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.669" end="00:26:55.119" style="s2">the other big thing here too is like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.580" end="00:26:56.259" style="s2">even in these conversations well we</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.119" end="00:26:59.590" style="s2">might not have had like a direct</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.259" end="00:27:00.730" style="s2">mediation and I think another important</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.590" end="00:27:04.600" style="s2">part that&#39;s come up multiple times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.730" end="00:27:06.249" style="s2">like not every mimetic mediation every</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.600" end="00:27:07.389" style="s2">time we&#39;re acting from a medication we</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.249" end="00:27:10.539" style="s2">don&#39;t need to arrive at some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.389" end="00:27:13.149" style="s2">conclusion it&#39;s an ongoing process and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.539" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that both of you will after</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.149" end="00:27:17.110" style="s2">this conversation go talk to some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:20.619" style="s2">your friends that may be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.110" end="00:27:22.809" style="s2">you know the old its display some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.619" end="00:27:23.799" style="s2">this conversation and light ways and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.809" end="00:27:25.929" style="s2">kind of say like yeah it was really</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.799" end="00:27:28.929" style="s2">weird how much we related and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.929" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">we we could explore experiencing very</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.929" end="00:27:34.299" style="s2">similar emotions on both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:36.519" style="s2">fence and and so yeah like I actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.299" end="00:27:38.139" style="s2">think mediation was happening here even</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.519" end="00:27:42.340" style="s2">though it&#39;s in it&#39;s more subtle kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.139" end="00:27:43.869" style="s2">long game form so it&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.340" end="00:27:46.749" style="s2">think is always kind of good to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.869" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">mind so that being said my reflections</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.749" end="00:27:49.990" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear if anybody else has</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:52.029" style="s2">anything if you do have to drop off at</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.990" end="00:27:56.350" style="s2">any time of course we are over time so</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.029" end="00:27:58.029" style="s2">please do so but yeah I think but kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.350" end="00:27:59.769" style="s2">of my last thoughts and thanks again and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.029" end="00:28:01.029" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m going to open it up and see if</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.769" end="00:28:03.539" style="s2">anybody else had anything that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.029" end="00:28:03.539" style="s2">wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.690" end="00:28:12.580" style="s2">I&#39;ll say wanting small even I spoke so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:14.739" style="s2">much already but um just I I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.580" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">what really helps me do this was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.739" end="00:28:19.659" style="s2">fact that this was I committed mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:21.070" style="s2">mediators group and whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.659" end="00:28:23.289" style="s2">people around anions I always like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.070" end="00:28:24.609" style="s2">everybody you always feel judged but</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.289" end="00:28:27.219" style="s2">here I felt like what was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.609" end="00:28:30.489" style="s2">judging me it was not going to be at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.219" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">how politically know how and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.489" end="00:28:38.489" style="s2">historically know how I was but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:42.879" style="s2">how comes like how human I could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.489" end="00:28:44.769" style="s2">because almost like like as a boy I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.879" end="00:28:46.570" style="s2">know things now but like how vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.769" end="00:28:48.700" style="s2">I would be would be like are you really</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.570" end="00:28:50.440" style="s2">being authentic and vulnerable and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.700" end="00:28:53.049" style="s2">wondered how that would affect even like</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.440" end="00:28:54.009" style="s2">the hardest people really like so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.049" end="00:28:55.539" style="s2">know these people here around you they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.009" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">don&#39;t really care what what was right</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.539" end="00:28:58.029" style="s2">and wrong they just want to see help</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.639" style="s2">human you can be I think that even</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.029" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">someone like the hardcore people of mine</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.639" end="00:29:05.369" style="s2">of my tribe would be when you push by</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:05.369" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.290" end="00:29:13.250" style="s2">yeah I just wanted to say thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.299" end="00:29:16.549" style="s2">because that was there was a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.250" end="00:29:17.330" style="s2">learned just in terms of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.549" end="00:29:19.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.330" end="00:29:22.190" style="s2">Benjamin hearing you are Benjamin Hassan</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.790" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">hearing you guys articulate that helped</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:48.860" style="s2">times you expressed a desire for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:52.009" style="s2">little bit more heat and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.860" end="00:29:53.899" style="s2">more passion fire and I do that I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.009" end="00:29:55.700" style="s2">think that that could be helpful given</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.899" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">that in a lot of these real life</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.700" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">situations will not be we will not have</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:02.539" style="s2">Luxuria but my medic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:04.070" style="s2">comforting environment so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.539" end="00:30:07.429" style="s2">can be more that can be helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.070" end="00:30:10.429" style="s2">practice in terms of um replicating a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.429" end="00:30:14.330" style="s2">real-life situation and this is my first</p>
