<p begin="00:00:07.950" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">you to a small experiment I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">gonna be running in the portal for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">while now we&#39;ve realized that many</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:16.830" style="s2">episodes have needs at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">the show in the first place there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.830" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">need for some housekeeping and in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:21.810" style="s2">second there&#39;s often a need to give some</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">context and a short introduction to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">episode so that our listeners can better</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:28.170" style="s2">understand why we&#39;re running it well</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:30.359" style="s2">what we thought about is that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">should stop doing that haphazardly if</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.359" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">instead we just decided that there would</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.420" style="s2">be two segments one dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">housekeeping sometimes light sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">more extensive and in the second we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:41.910" style="s2">a segment that actually gives the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">context and an introduction to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">guests or whatever the point of a</p>

<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna work and we reserve the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">right to go back but we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">listen to you and trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">what is doable</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">the second item of business surrounds</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">the set of rather exotic circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">under which this week&#39;s podcast is being</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">released as of this recording I am now</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">self isolating at home under essentially</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">way of viewing this is to see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:12.390" style="s2">giant overreaction now I don&#39;t hold this</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">view and I don&#39;t wish to promote it but</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.390" end="00:01:16.500" style="s2">the idea is that we have learned to live</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">with influenza and this virus is similar</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.500" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">in some ways to the familiar flu I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">sure you&#39;ve heard this from others I</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go into it and develop the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">idea here a second way of seeing this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">it as an incredibly rapid societal</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">change in deeply grooved behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">patterns unfolding over perhaps the last</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">this angle it is astonishingly agenting</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">as measured at least by the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">change and thus perhaps it could signal</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">the beginning of the end of the nearly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">50-year dream state we have discussed on</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">this program that said in some time in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">the early to mid-1970s and signaled the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">end of the previous post-war growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:53.909" style="s2">regime yet a different way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">the reaction of the pandemic is to view</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.909" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">it as a slow and inadequate response to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">a very serious situation to this way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">thinking the most agenda kamon us were</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">worried about the situation since at</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">least January 2020 and they were simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">getting no traction in talking through</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.210" style="s2">why they were alarmed when attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">convince the rest</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.210" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">us of course all three positions have</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:15.600" style="s2">some merit but the first seems misguided</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">to me and I think the last has the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.600" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">substance many people have asked me how</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:21.660" style="s2">I&#39;m sense making in the current</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">environment the answer is rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.660" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">disappointing my answer is that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">unfortunately appear to be among the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">most confused of my colleagues almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">everywhere I turned people around me are</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">nearly certain of things that contradict</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">what various others of my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">know to be true unsurprisingly most of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.300" style="s2">these colleagues have settled on various</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">strategies on which they place great</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.300" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">emphasis so then the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">definitely ventilators unless it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">really Rea gence and testing instead or</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">perhaps nothing else matters like</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">behavior modification that is if</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">vaccines and treatments aren&#39;t the clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">way to go I want to share with you what</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">I get from listening in on such private</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">conversations with some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">respected names in health science and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:04.770" style="s2">technology I&#39;m sorry to say what I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">is confusion I am sorry to report that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.770" end="00:03:09.210" style="s2">after many phone calls and having read a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:11.520" style="s2">fair amount I have not heard a truly</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.210" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">coherent comprehensive narrative emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.520" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">around this virus no one really trusts</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">China to report it in itself and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">don&#39;t yet have enough time with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">disease outside of China to speak about</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">what am I doing personally well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.730" end="00:03:26.550" style="s2">first thing that I&#39;m at least trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:27.770" style="s2">do is to stop listening to the very</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.550" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">sources that fed me bad information</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.770" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">initially telling me not even to worry</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">when I had the maximal amount of time to</p>

<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">reporting is what I&#39;ve elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.210" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">referred to as pure journey genic harm</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">now you can say that democracy dies in</p>

<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">also dies in civil society when you are</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.460" end="00:05:27.300" style="s2">suggested looking up ground-glass</p>

<p begin="00:05:29.009" end="00:05:33.599" style="s2">interesting as well but instead of an</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.599" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">too often getting the opposite to put it</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.159" end="00:05:53.939" style="s2">getting as few people to panic as</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.629" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">possible when the correct thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.939" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">to ask why our leaders didn&#39;t push for</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.819" end="00:06:18.210" style="s2">ideal world would be to level with</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.289" end="00:06:35.789" style="s2">do on a going-forward basis is twofold</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.889" end="00:08:06.919" style="s2">I would like to say some brief words of</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.919" end="00:08:11.150" style="s2">James O&#39;Keefe of Project Veritas first</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.469" end="00:08:12.710" style="s2">of all I respect James for being willing</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:14.120" style="s2">to come on the portal as our beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.710" end="00:08:17.090" style="s2">interaction on Twitter was not</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.120" end="00:08:18.830" style="s2">auspicious as I recall I wrote I hate</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.090" end="00:08:20.629" style="s2">this shitty hidden-camera gotcha crap</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.830" end="00:08:21.710" style="s2">and perhaps unsurprisingly he took</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.629" end="00:08:23.810" style="s2">immediate exception</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.710" end="00:08:25.340" style="s2">I found his response interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.810" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">invited him on the program to explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.340" end="00:08:29.979" style="s2">himself and to my surprise he accepted</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:32.029" style="s2">despite my unconcealed hostility I</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.979" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">admired that willingness to face a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.029" end="00:08:36.409" style="s2">critic and I&#39;ve endeavoured ever since</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:38.510" style="s2">with James to be a constructive one on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.409" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">preliminary setup call I promised him</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:41.449" style="s2">that there would be no gotchas and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:43.849" style="s2">actually said that that was unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.449" end="00:08:45.260" style="s2">I told him that our politics were likely</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.849" end="00:08:47.029" style="s2">opposite and then I wouldn&#39;t pull any</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.260" end="00:08:48.680" style="s2">punches nor would I pretend that I was</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.680" end="00:08:53.300" style="s2">does such as in the case of his pushing</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.920" end="00:09:11.329" style="s2">even more heroic in having gotten the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.779" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">story early I did tell James however</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.329" end="00:09:14.870" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t like his choice of targets</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:16.610" style="s2">and that his methods made me very</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:26.600" style="s2">begin by reminding our viewers and</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:49.160" style="s2">tweeted that out and I responded why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.570" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">this person suspended because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.160" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">socialist question mark because he</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:56.420" style="s2">because he discusses the dinosaur</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.420" end="00:12:01.520" style="s2">is thinking about institutional bias</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.340" end="00:12:03.950" style="s2">dunno and then I say I also have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.520" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">admit I hate this shitty hidden camera</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.980" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.210" end="00:12:26.960" style="s2">you prefer I report this all caps</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.840" end="00:12:39.980" style="s2">question let me answer this as honestly</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:42.170" style="s2">as I can we have a William Tell problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.980" end="00:12:43.820" style="s2">aim too high and you miss the story aim</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.170" end="00:12:46.070" style="s2">too low and you kill the impact due to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.820" end="00:12:47.780" style="s2">the uncomfortable methods in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.070" end="00:12:49.730" style="s2">you are aiming too low and I am aiming</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.780" end="00:12:53.420" style="s2">too high and I think that that really</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.730" end="00:12:55.700" style="s2">comes down to the the the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.420" end="00:12:57.830" style="s2">issue that we have for listeners and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.700" end="00:13:01.250" style="s2">viewers today which is I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.830" end="00:13:03.490" style="s2">are agreed on a lot about the problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.250" end="00:13:07.070" style="s2">in the current system mm-hm and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.490" end="00:13:09.890" style="s2">radically divided by the methods and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.070" end="00:13:13.550" style="s2">very concerned about the damage Project</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.890" end="00:13:16.460" style="s2">Veritas is doing and I&#39;m also interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.550" end="00:13:18.350" style="s2">in the progress project Veritas is</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.460" end="00:13:20.900" style="s2">making and most people want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.350" end="00:13:22.730" style="s2">one or the other perspective right and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.900" end="00:13:25.730" style="s2">have a superposition of the two issues</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.730" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">so I thought that place to start</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.730" end="00:13:28.790" style="s2">that&#39;d be a great place to start do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">want to talk a little bit about how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.790" end="00:13:31.400" style="s2">saw the interaction in any background</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.650" style="s2">that you want to bring to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.400" end="00:13:35.390" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s a lot to unpack here</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.650" end="00:13:37.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a million things to directions</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.390" end="00:13:38.870" style="s2">to go into but I thought that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.310" end="00:13:40.820" style="s2">interesting conversation and credit to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.870" end="00:13:43.250" style="s2">you because after having the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.820" end="00:13:45.230" style="s2">conversation you actually invited me to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.250" end="00:13:47.630" style="s2">talk to you and to call you and that in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.230" end="00:13:49.700" style="s2">kudos to you because most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.630" end="00:13:52.070" style="s2">I deal with don&#39;t even think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.700" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">human they kind of want to dehumanize me</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.070" end="00:13:57.740" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to engage me in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:14:00.920" style="s2">conversation so thank you I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.740" end="00:14:01.820" style="s2">that I think that a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.920" end="00:14:04.310" style="s2">ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.820" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">about the methods of what we do but in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.310" end="00:14:09.050" style="s2">reality it&#39;s about the findings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:11.660" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not about the methods it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.050" end="00:14:14.750" style="s2">it&#39;s used as a kind of an excuse and in</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.750" end="00:14:19.490" style="s2">were referring to this is a common theme</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.030" end="00:14:21.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the ethics of recording</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.490" end="00:14:23.930" style="s2">someone like David Wright was in a bar</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.800" end="00:14:26.390" style="s2">in New Hampshire and do we want to live</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.220" end="00:14:39.520" style="s2">been my whole life that reporters are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.130" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">there there&#39;s a routine nature in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.520" end="00:14:44.630" style="s2">journalistic methods to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:46.459" style="s2">both utilize deception and to broadcast</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.550" end="00:15:00.529" style="s2">standard in the industry reporters make</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.610" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">you think that they&#39;re your friend and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.529" end="00:15:04.579" style="s2">then they betray your confidence they</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.660" end="00:15:06.529" style="s2">appeal to your sense of loneliness or</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.579" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">vanity and then they betray you they</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.529" end="00:15:10.940" style="s2">pull the rug underneath you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.949" style="s2">that&#39;s what I meant when I said that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.949" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">and then when it comes to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.660" end="00:15:19.490" style="s2">medium itself which we will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:21.709" style="s2">here today the camera is a more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.490" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">version of the events in question so</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.709" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">surely not just from a legal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">but from a moral one we would consider a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.930" end="00:15:31.699" style="s2">consider it unreasonable to place</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:33.800" style="s2">ethical restrictions on recording</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.699" end="00:15:36.709" style="s2">someone when we don&#39;t place restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.800" end="00:15:38.690" style="s2">on someone writing what they set down</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.709" end="00:15:40.269" style="s2">with a pencil and paper and shouting it</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.269" end="00:15:46.490" style="s2">because the recording does the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:50.060" style="s2">individual more justice than second-hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.490" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">hearsay you know words or different</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.060" end="00:15:53.180" style="s2">mediums so that was the point I was</p>

<p begin="00:15:53.180" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">avert we had a very honest</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.230" end="00:15:59.269" style="s2">back-and-forth there and I appreciate it</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.269" end="00:16:04.970" style="s2">you know I think your your tagline is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.680" style="s2">something like be brave be brave do</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.680" end="00:16:10.579" style="s2">think that it&#39;s brave to come into</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.689" end="00:16:23.149" style="s2">try to be radically different than most</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.269" end="00:16:26.329" style="s2">of these interviews I&#39;ve told you that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.149" end="00:16:28.040" style="s2">there will be no gotchas and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.329" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">stick to that because I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.130" end="00:16:34.759" style="s2">thought was incredibly honest was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.930" end="00:16:36.949" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting thing to say because</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.829" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">what I said in response was it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.350" end="00:16:46.310" style="s2">interesting question whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:48.649" style="s2">gotcha problem that I see in the news</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.310" end="00:16:51.470" style="s2">industry should be doubled where you you</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.470" end="00:16:54.780" style="s2">should try to set an example of cut that</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:49.770" style="s2">think you&#39;re the devil mmm I think what</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.310" end="00:17:51.780" style="s2">I&#39;m really concerned about in part is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.770" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">that you are actually damaging the</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.070" end="00:18:09.030" style="s2">we have a situation in which for example</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.810" end="00:21:14.270" style="s2">I happen to agree with these people what</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:17.070" style="s2">they said but when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.270" end="00:21:18.420" style="s2">methods you have a choice to make</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:25.860" style="s2">completely deceptive and ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">they used their physics reporter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.860" end="00:27:29.610" style="s2">whose name is Dennis Overby and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:31.980" style="s2">thought that was a complete hatchet job</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.220" end="00:27:54.690" style="s2">better understanding I think Michael</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.980" end="00:27:56.039" style="s2">Phillips was the journalist who covered</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.690" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">me at the Wall Street Journal who did a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.039" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">complete hatchet job on me and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:03.059" style="s2">go through biron column so yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">name names if</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.059" end="00:28:07.799" style="s2">that&#39;s actually but what I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:10.379" style="s2">for and the point being is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.799" end="00:28:13.320" style="s2">we we&#39;re not beat reporter we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.379" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">we&#39;re not no I&#39;m trying to come right</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.320" end="00:28:18.629" style="s2">right sure thing I do understand what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:21.090" style="s2">think you&#39;re saying which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.629" end="00:28:23.129" style="s2">game of reporters is to be these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.090" end="00:28:24.840" style="s2">deceptive sociopaths if you will and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.129" end="00:28:26.519" style="s2">then you get to say no no I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.840" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">sociopath I&#39;m a reporter so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.519" end="00:28:30.450" style="s2">sociopathic tendencies in some sense you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:32.190" style="s2">get to work for one of these papers and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.450" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">then you get a halo attached to your</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.190" end="00:28:35.340" style="s2">head which allows you to do things which</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:37.529" style="s2">in other circumstances would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.340" end="00:28:39.059" style="s2">completely deceptive and in fact your</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.529" end="00:28:40.649" style="s2">point to me and I think this is great</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.059" end="00:28:41.999" style="s2">and this is just like super complicated</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.649" end="00:28:45.029" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to take the time to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.999" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">it is is that the style of reporting</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.029" end="00:28:49.049" style="s2">that you do has gone out of favor in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">certain sense because of the costs</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.049" end="00:28:52.940" style="s2">because of the risks and that what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:55.169" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.940" end="00:28:56.970" style="s2">resuscitating an earlier form of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.169" end="00:28:59.909" style="s2">journalism in a different medium in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.970" end="00:29:02.009" style="s2">different medium with a different tinge</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.909" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">and a different institutional backing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.009" end="00:29:05.820" style="s2">and so I think that this is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:10.409" style="s2">incredibly complex thing to be pulled</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.820" end="00:29:12.419" style="s2">apart yeah because in some sense what</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.409" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">happened in my into my way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.419" end="00:29:16.169" style="s2">is is the journalists used to hunt</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:19.139" style="s2">institutions when they were heroes in</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.169" end="00:29:21.179" style="s2">Kings and then they went from hunting</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.139" end="00:29:23.970" style="s2">institutions to hunting the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.179" end="00:29:24.929" style="s2">individuals that disrupt institutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.970" end="00:29:27.299" style="s2">yes 100%</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.929" end="00:29:28.740" style="s2">and so my feeling about this is you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.299" end="00:29:29.639" style="s2">to know why the reputation of the press</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:32.309" style="s2">is in the toilet</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.639" end="00:29:35.340" style="s2">it&#39;s in general because what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.309" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">is it has changed its the focus of its</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.340" end="00:29:40.019" style="s2">crosshairs to Noble individual let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">talk about that for one minute sure the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.019" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;ve learned doing this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">is that and the New York Times did a</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.310" end="00:43:32.680" style="s2">my problem and I really want you to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:36.230" style="s2">the time to play this through with me I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.680" end="00:43:36.680" style="s2">watched what happened when that debuted</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.230" end="00:43:41.030" style="s2">with</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.490" end="00:43:50.690" style="s2">responsible for it but we both have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.200" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">agree with the game is the game is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.690" end="00:43:54.410" style="s2">that anything that comes through James</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:57.349" style="s2">O&#39;Keefe and anything that comes through</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.410" end="00:43:58.609" style="s2">Project Veritas cannot be trusted right</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.349" end="00:44:00.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;ve done they can fit</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.609" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">they fitted you with a shit suit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.410" end="00:44:05.900" style="s2">your shit suit is you are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:08.329" style="s2">psychopathic so not a reliable then even</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.900" end="00:44:10.790" style="s2">what appears to be continuous unedited</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.329" end="00:44:13.430" style="s2">footage can be completely discounted if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.790" end="00:44:15.859" style="s2">it appears this project Veritas and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.430" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">has not stopped us well not only has it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.859" end="00:44:20.630" style="s2">not stopped you it creates a really</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:24.520" style="s2">interesting dilemma first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.630" end="00:44:28.520" style="s2">tactic that is being used against you is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.520" end="00:44:30.770" style="s2">manifestly stupid and unethical and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.520" end="00:44:34.099" style="s2">nothing I can do about it no no what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.770" end="00:44:36.859" style="s2">jump in ahead I don&#39;t agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.099" end="00:44:38.210" style="s2">James I think that the the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.859" end="00:44:39.109" style="s2">that this is at such a level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.210" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.109" end="00:44:43.730" style="s2">whatever the ABC News function is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:45.650" style="s2">stop that stop that story from running</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.730" end="00:44:47.299" style="s2">that might have saved people from having</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.650" end="00:44:50.569" style="s2">terrible incidents in their lives I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.299" end="00:44:51.579" style="s2">don&#39;t know whatever that thing was is my</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.569" end="00:44:55.010" style="s2">enemy</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.579" end="00:44:56.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the disc and we have to slip the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.010" end="00:44:59.720" style="s2">disc in order to save our society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.839" end="00:45:01.339" style="s2">basically my take I also agree that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.720" end="00:45:02.809" style="s2">you&#39;ve been fitted with this thing so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.339" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">that if you&#39;re handed a piece of footage</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.809" end="00:45:07.609" style="s2">and you run it and it is appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:11.869" style="s2">you to run it that that footage</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.609" end="00:45:13.490" style="s2">immediately becomes inadmissible in what</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.869" end="00:45:15.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve called the gated institutional</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.490" end="00:45:17.030" style="s2">narrative which is the Washington Post</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.470" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">discussing the New York Times about</p>

<p begin="00:45:21.710" end="00:45:27.349" style="s2">you know blah blah blah blah yes that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.290" end="00:45:27.980" style="s2">thing is trying to seal itself off from</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.980" end="00:45:31.099" style="s2">so the idea is that there are Thorat</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.750" end="00:45:33.230" style="s2">ativ sources and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.099" end="00:45:37.180" style="s2">garbage that happens online which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.230" end="00:45:40.099" style="s2">ridiculous I don&#39;t think you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.180" end="00:45:42.230" style="s2">break this thing open because what</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.099" end="00:45:44.299" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is in in essence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.230" end="00:45:47.660" style="s2">this weak point in the crust and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.299" end="00:45:50.059" style="s2">this magma of truth underneath it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.660" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">and they&#39;ve decided okay anything that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.059" end="00:45:53.450" style="s2">breaks</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.180" style="s2">through at project Veritas is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.450" end="00:45:57.980" style="s2">immediately inadmissible and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.180" end="00:45:59.780" style="s2">important that I&#39;d be able to defend</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.980" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">something that occurs at your outlet</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.780" end="00:46:04.850" style="s2">okay and you&#39;re not helping me because</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">of the level at which you&#39;re playing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.850" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">game and so maybe that&#39;s partially my</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:10.850" style="s2">frustration I don&#39;t believe that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:12.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s a deep fake interview I</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.850" end="00:46:14.119" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s a real hot mic I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.680" end="00:46:16.010" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s leaked I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.119" end="00:46:17.720" style="s2">you probably have lawyers who went all</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.010" end="00:46:20.450" style="s2">over it and said it was legal for you to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.720" end="00:46:21.980" style="s2">use it I bet that you probably even do</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.450" end="00:46:23.600" style="s2">something that regular journalists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.980" end="00:46:28.100" style="s2">do which is check the journalists code</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.600" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">of ethics right and so all of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.100" end="00:46:34.310" style="s2">positive stuff that you&#39;re doing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">is then sacrificed in part in in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.310" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">opinion because of certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:42.430" style="s2">super aggressive self-justifying tactics</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:46.670" style="s2">which is what&#39;s really pissing me off</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.430" end="00:46:48.470" style="s2">I&#39;d like to yeah yes your shirt if I go</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.670" end="00:46:50.630" style="s2">into the wrong direction just steer me</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.470" end="00:46:52.850" style="s2">back no if I&#39;m overboard and not getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.630" end="00:46:55.940" style="s2">something you let me know this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.850" end="00:46:58.070" style="s2">important point and we have some</p>

<p begin="00:55:25.970" end="00:55:29.860" style="s2">is zero</p>

<p begin="00:55:29.860" end="00:55:35.780" style="s2">so the key question is don&#39;t we as</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.140" end="00:55:39.140" style="s2">Americans have an oral torah an idea of</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.140" end="00:55:43.220" style="s2">along with the written rule and you tend</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.600" end="00:55:45.290" style="s2">to get alerted to this when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.220" end="00:55:47.210" style="s2">says that something is perfectly legal</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.290" end="00:55:48.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the phrase that alerts you to the</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.690" end="00:55:54.680" style="s2">is that they say perfectly legal rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.670" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">than merely legal and I&#39;m concerned that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.680" end="00:56:01.310" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is perfectly legal and</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:28.070" style="s2">admitted that when Alexander Graham Bell</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.090" end="00:57:29.360" style="s2">invented the telephone it was like well</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.070" end="00:57:32.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of an invasion of privacy</p>

<p begin="00:58:00.980" end="00:58:05.180" style="s2">difference between recording something</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.630" end="00:58:07.880" style="s2">and broadcasting it and I would say this</p>

<p begin="00:58:22.010" end="00:58:26.300" style="s2">there was an example where someone at a</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.210" end="00:58:52.250" style="s2">of profound public importance now I also</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.210" end="00:58:54.950" style="s2">tell you that when Upton Sinclair yeah</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.730" end="01:03:33.170" style="s2">the sense that journalism used to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.890" end="01:03:35.030" style="s2">very different and much closer to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.170" end="01:03:37.640" style="s2">methods that you&#39;re using is that true</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.030" end="01:03:39.380" style="s2">I would say even further so then the</p>

<p begin="01:03:58.010" end="01:04:02.030" style="s2">aggressive style of investigative</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.130" end="01:06:22.100" style="s2">ironic and they filmed all of the city</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.340" end="01:06:26.600" style="s2">inspectors taking bribes bribing each</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:47.840" style="s2">consequential in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.950" end="01:06:49.580" style="s2">investigation of the 20th century like</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.840" end="01:06:52.100" style="s2">50 people went to jail</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.130" end="01:09:51.950" style="s2">belief is that the Pulitzer part the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.640" end="01:09:56.300" style="s2">Pulitzer Prize to say nothing of worth</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.950" end="01:10:01.340" style="s2">the puter fortune came from was intended</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.300" end="01:10:04.340" style="s2">to say this is heroic behavior this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.340" end="01:10:06.380" style="s2">admirable behavior and when you took</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.340" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">away the prize it was the community</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.380" end="01:10:13.910" style="s2">saying we no longer want to see this as</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:14.860" style="s2">heroic yeah and that that message rather</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.910" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">than the prize</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.860" end="01:10:21.659" style="s2">is is the chill and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:26.380" style="s2">reasons well to your point about the</p>

<p begin="01:10:29.260" end="01:10:34.090" style="s2">cover those links were not absent</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:35.830" style="s2">earlier in fact there were some you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.090" end="01:10:39.580" style="s2">I asked you to look at the story of Jean</p>

<p begin="01:10:39.580" end="01:10:48.280" style="s2">using the Los Angeles Times in Newsweek</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.190" end="01:10:58.500" style="s2">politics so there have been very</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.610" end="01:11:01.480" style="s2">chilling threads between our media and</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.500" end="01:11:05.969" style="s2">the institutions of power and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.480" end="01:11:08.860" style="s2">the cryptic institutions of power what I</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.969" end="01:11:11.500" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is given that those</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.860" end="01:11:13.170" style="s2">things existed before something had to</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.500" end="01:11:16.119" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.170" end="01:11:18.159" style="s2">environmentally for this type of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.119" end="01:11:20.679" style="s2">reporting to all but disappear over a</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.159" end="01:11:22.750" style="s2">period of a perhaps twenty years and</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.679" end="01:11:25.719" style="s2">that&#39;s economics a lot of it in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.750" end="01:11:27.580" style="s2">opinion investigative reporting was a</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.719" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">lost leader on a company&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.580" end="01:11:32.980" style="s2">so in those days there was kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:35.500" style="s2">newspapers were certainly more</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.980" end="01:11:38.139" style="s2">profitable than they are now and David</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.500" end="01:11:39.909" style="s2">Wright on the ABC tape put it thus he</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.139" end="01:11:42.340" style="s2">said it changed in the digital era when</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.909" end="01:11:44.230" style="s2">it became even more commercially he says</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.340" end="01:11:46.420" style="s2">the commercial commercial imperative is</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.230" end="01:11:48.070" style="s2">incompatible with the news and I get</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.420" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">branded as some right-wing guy and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.070" end="01:11:52.510" style="s2">like well I actually that&#39;s a Chomsky</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:54.880" style="s2">argument from manufactured a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.510" end="01:11:58.449" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest a lot of my friends on</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.880" end="01:12:00.130" style="s2">the right spend a lot of time quoting</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.449" end="01:12:02.710" style="s2">Marx Chomsky there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.130" end="01:12:05.199" style="s2">commonalities there is there is that and</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.710" end="01:12:06.940" style="s2">I agree with that statement so the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:08.350" style="s2">commercial imperative is incompatible</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.940" end="01:12:10.409" style="s2">the news said David Wright he was</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.350" end="01:12:12.760" style="s2">suspended by ABC News for saying it and</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.760" end="01:12:30.490" style="s2">company and I had to be the chairman</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.030" end="01:12:33.310" style="s2">to have the authority to make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.490" end="01:12:35.590" style="s2">like not to settle lawsuits you know 60</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.310" end="01:12:38.950" style="s2">minutes got sued over a hundred and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.590" end="01:12:40.810" style="s2">fifty times in the 1980s 100 maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.950" end="01:12:43.060" style="s2">more than that all of the reporters I</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.810" end="01:12:45.520" style="s2">mentioned earlier the 1970s were I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.060" end="01:12:47.530" style="s2">some of them went to jail to protect</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.520" end="01:12:49.900" style="s2">their sources they were sued for libel</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.530" end="01:12:52.090" style="s2">yeah investigative reporters had to deal</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.900" end="01:12:52.780" style="s2">with all that stuff and to your point in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.090" end="01:12:54.580" style="s2">this age</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.780" end="01:12:55.780" style="s2">I&#39;m vilified for having to deal with all</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.580" end="01:12:58.600" style="s2">that stuff back in the day was</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.780" end="01:12:59.950" style="s2">considered to be a thing so you&#39;d go to</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.600" end="01:13:01.960" style="s2">jail for your source a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.950" end="01:13:04.180" style="s2">and ready to jail I&#39;ve been to jail we</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.960" end="01:13:06.070" style="s2">talked about that but not only would not</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.180" end="01:13:07.180" style="s2">only does the reporter have to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.070" end="01:13:09.630" style="s2">willing to go to jail</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.180" end="01:13:11.980" style="s2">there the reporter has to be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.630" end="01:13:13.090" style="s2">appeal it all the way up to the Supreme</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.980" end="01:13:15.220" style="s2">Court and if the supreme court</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.090" end="01:13:16.870" style="s2">determines that you have to disclose</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.220" end="01:13:19.270" style="s2">your source the reporter has to be civil</p>

<p begin="01:13:19.270" end="01:13:23.080" style="s2">believe in in your heart to do this most</p>

<p begin="01:13:32.590" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">is that you have so many of the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.200" end="01:13:43.870" style="s2">admirable features of journalism and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:47.710" style="s2">don&#39;t think you get to have the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.870" end="01:13:51.310" style="s2">conversation where somebody who really</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.710" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">is troubled by what you do also</p>

<p begin="01:14:00.900" end="01:14:09.160" style="s2">why I can&#39;t stand journalism that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.640" end="01:14:11.380" style="s2">so I think in light of the recent</p>

<p begin="01:14:44.110" end="01:14:48.590" style="s2">so by the way I should just say people</p>

<p begin="01:15:07.100" end="01:15:11.000" style="s2">thing but so the economics I&#39;m asked me</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.560" end="01:15:12.590" style="s2">this is a very important point you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.000" end="01:15:14.360" style="s2">one of the reporters I researched and</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.590" end="01:15:17.090" style="s2">Pravda when I wrote this book Pravda was</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.360" end="01:15:19.190" style="s2">that bosses have to have they said</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.090" end="01:15:21.470" style="s2">bosses with balls right you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.190" end="01:15:24.500" style="s2">an editor or someone that works for you</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.470" end="01:15:27.140" style="s2">that has cojones that has principal and</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.500" end="01:15:28.880" style="s2">warehouses unisex because it works for</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.140" end="01:15:32.030" style="s2">both what is it what is it huevos huevos</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.880" end="01:15:34.100" style="s2">huevos you have to have huevos and in</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.030" end="01:15:36.650" style="s2">back in the day there were bosses with</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.100" end="01:15:39.680" style="s2">balls anyway in these days what David</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.650" end="01:15:41.900" style="s2">Wright says is this is so ironic Dave</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.680" end="01:15:44.870" style="s2">Wright actually says at the bar</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.900" end="01:15:47.930" style="s2">my bosses don&#39;t care about this stuff so</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.870" end="01:15:50.030" style="s2">that&#39;s is that integrity is a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.930" end="01:15:52.550" style="s2">morality and then you have the economics</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.030" end="01:15:55.010" style="s2">of mass media it costs my my</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.550" end="01:15:57.860" style="s2">organization or our organization because</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.010" end="01:16:00.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a nonprofit project Veritas over 1</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.860" end="01:16:03.470" style="s2">million dollars to do a story and</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.550" end="01:16:05.000" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;ll cost us as much as 3/4</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.470" end="01:16:07.640" style="s2">of a million dollars to fight a lawsuit</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.000" end="01:16:10.010" style="s2">I do not settle lawsuits Eric in fact</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.640" end="01:16:12.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve we&#39;ve won eight straight lawsuit</p>

<p begin="01:16:21.260" end="01:16:23.870" style="s2">a mistake and I&#39;ll never make that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.550" end="01:16:25.880" style="s2">mistake again so I appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.870" end="01:16:28.940" style="s2">distinction but you have settled just</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.880" end="01:16:30.620" style="s2">important distinction every time you say</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.940" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t they&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="01:16:38.840" end="01:16:44.150" style="s2">fair hearing yeah let me be clear we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.780" end="01:16:45.830" style="s2">never lost a defamation lawsuit we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.150" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">never settled a defamation lawsuit and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.830" end="01:16:50.540" style="s2">11 years ago I was sued for invasion of</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:52.820" style="s2">privacy for recording a guy in a room</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.540" end="01:16:54.440" style="s2">with the door open in California this</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:01.070" style="s2">claimed later he would claim he was</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.030" end="01:17:03.199" style="s2">playing along but I did not defame him</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.070" end="01:17:05.239" style="s2">by quoting him and I was sued for</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.199" end="01:17:06.949" style="s2">invasion of privacy I fought it and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.239" end="01:17:08.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any money so I settled so we</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.949" end="01:17:10.100" style="s2">don&#39;t settle lawsuits anymore we&#39;ve won</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.750" end="01:17:12.430" style="s2">every lawsuit we&#39;ve laid by the way I</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.100" end="01:17:14.660" style="s2">also I just want to be very clear that</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.430" end="01:17:16.489" style="s2">there are all sorts of situations where</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.660" end="01:17:18.920" style="s2">people settle when they&#39;re in the right</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.489" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">because of the economics of the legal</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.920" end="01:17:22.190" style="s2">profession there he&#39;ll do a different</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:23.930" style="s2">standard than me all right so totally</p>

<p begin="01:23:17.950" end="01:23:23.680" style="s2">address your the fundamental issue here</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.020" end="01:23:26.620" style="s2">of the the purse scam or the button cam</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.540" end="01:23:42.730" style="s2">I guess the easiest way I can explain it</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.469" end="01:23:46.540" style="s2">in in a very personal way is that when I</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.730" end="01:23:49.210" style="s2">was in college I went to Rutgers I&#39;m 20</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.540" end="01:23:51.489" style="s2">35 years old so when I was 20 years old</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.210" end="01:23:53.500" style="s2">on st. Patrick&#39;s Day which I believe is</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.500" end="01:23:57.460" style="s2">around st. Patrick&#39;s Day filming here I</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.180" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">was surrounded by professors telling me</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.460" end="01:24:01.600" style="s2">how great Stalin was and I&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:04.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not really a history buff but that</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.600" end="01:24:05.890" style="s2">seems odd you know shouldn&#39;t we also</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.120" end="01:24:07.989" style="s2">talked about the gulags and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.890" end="01:24:10.300" style="s2">not I wasn&#39;t a very show trials it was a</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.989" end="01:24:12.340" style="s2">way I wasn&#39;t learning about Stalin I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.300" end="01:24:13.780" style="s2">just said well that&#39;s odd and I&#39;d read</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.340" end="01:24:15.100" style="s2">the New York Times every day because I</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.780" end="01:24:16.840" style="s2">just like to read the New York Times I</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.100" end="01:24:19.989" style="s2">said well that&#39;s odd they seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.840" end="01:24:22.840" style="s2">using obfuscation in there and I felt</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.989" end="01:24:25.630" style="s2">compelled to wear a hidden camera and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.840" end="01:24:27.219" style="s2">going to my dining hall to try to prove</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.630" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">a point and I tried to get Lucky Charms</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.219" end="01:24:32.350" style="s2">banned on the grounds they were racist</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:34.989" style="s2">to my Irish heritage it was a little</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.350" end="01:24:37.030" style="s2">stunt like it was a little Borat like it</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.989" end="01:24:39.130" style="s2">remains people&#39;s favorite video I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.030" end="01:24:42.280" style="s2">getting to a point here and that what I</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.130" end="01:24:45.130" style="s2">what I realized in doing this was that I</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.280" end="01:24:48.250" style="s2">had to hold these people to their own</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.130" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">expressed values because they don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.250" end="01:24:51.969" style="s2">really hard to shame these people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.050" end="01:24:53.350" style="s2">and and we can be shamed because you</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.969" end="01:24:55.719" style="s2">believe in morality you believe in</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.350" end="01:24:57.190" style="s2">probably some sense of law and there</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.670" end="01:25:05.170" style="s2">irrational they&#39;re just like Stalin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.130" end="01:25:07.239" style="s2">great you should love him and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.170" end="01:25:08.650" style="s2">well I&#39;m paying money to come to school</p>

<p begin="01:28:09.290" end="01:28:12.320" style="s2">done but let&#39;s make sure that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.610" end="01:28:14.420" style="s2">actually do disagree that we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:28:14.420" end="01:28:20.360" style="s2">but that statement you&#39;re making Zach</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.060" end="01:28:21.620" style="s2">for he says documents Zach you know you</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.360" end="01:28:23.870" style="s2">know I&#39;d come to me you know come to us</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.620" end="01:28:25.940" style="s2">some years ago we had to send a reporter</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.870" end="01:28:28.100" style="s2">to talk to Jen Jen I who was an</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.940" end="01:28:31.340" style="s2">innovation person for Google she was of</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.100" end="01:28:33.940" style="s2">Irish heritage and we we filmed her in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.340" end="01:28:36.260" style="s2">in a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.940" end="01:28:39.440" style="s2">saying that she wanted to prevent the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.260" end="01:28:41.449" style="s2">quote Trump situation and there was some</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.440" end="01:28:43.250" style="s2">ambiguity about what exactly she meant</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.449" end="01:28:44.810" style="s2">by that did she means stop Trump from</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.250" end="01:28:46.910" style="s2">winning the election did she means stop</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.810" end="01:28:48.140" style="s2">Russian interference but Jen&#39;s and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.910" end="01:28:50.390" style="s2">also said on this hidden camera</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.140" end="01:28:52.790" style="s2">recording which Zak did not provide to</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.390" end="01:28:55.429" style="s2">us that I was filmed by our undercover</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.790" end="01:28:59.120" style="s2">reporters she also said that um that</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.429" end="01:29:00.770" style="s2">Google needs to stay big - too - yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.120" end="01:29:02.330" style="s2">feel a fragmented then you wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.770" end="01:29:05.540" style="s2">able then you wouldn&#39;t be able to to</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.330" end="01:29:08.320" style="s2">stop Trump essentially so this is what</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.540" end="01:29:11.120" style="s2">this person said and that amplified</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.320" end="01:29:13.610" style="s2">Zach&#39;s messages his documents that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.120" end="01:29:16.940" style="s2">interviewed him and I I feel very</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.610" end="01:29:18.890" style="s2">strongly that I know do you understand</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.940" end="01:29:21.770" style="s2">I&#39;m worried that we&#39;re not communicating</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.890" end="01:29:24.890" style="s2">again I agree that there&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.770" end="01:29:27.739" style="s2">strange problem that you can&#39;t go to CNN</p>

<p begin="01:30:23.060" end="01:30:28.100" style="s2">something to the effect of we have to</p>

<p begin="01:31:03.740" end="01:31:06.410" style="s2">of the government and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.970" end="01:31:08.000" style="s2">probably agree with that too if you</p>

<p begin="01:31:12.710" end="01:31:17.300" style="s2">but unlike the government no we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:40:48.090" end="01:40:55.079" style="s2">particularly animated by the story of</p>

<p begin="01:47:00.519" end="01:47:08.440" style="s2">that was mainstream yes let&#39;s put that</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.190" end="01:47:10.420" style="s2">out Chris Hansen an NBC NBC NBC Dateline</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.440" end="01:47:13.510" style="s2">Chris Hansen would set up these people</p>

<p begin="01:47:23.800" end="01:47:27.820" style="s2">I would say to ethicists were just</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.749" end="01:47:29.559" style="s2">literally letting people and I and I</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.820" end="01:47:31.420" style="s2">mean it&#39;s too strong with right we</p>

<p begin="01:47:31.420" end="01:47:37.059" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to yeah what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.639" end="01:47:40.409" style="s2">to do is to say what Dateline did if it</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.059" end="01:47:44.739" style="s2">is in fact Dateline Dateline NBC daily</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.409" end="01:47:46.929" style="s2">was to set up something much more</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.739" end="01:47:51.749" style="s2">extreme in some sense than what you do</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.929" end="01:47:54.159" style="s2">and to use the entertainment value of</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.749" end="01:47:56.340" style="s2">catching and destroying someone who</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.159" end="01:48:00.729" style="s2">would prey on show you have something an</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.340" end="01:48:02.860" style="s2">activity which is completely evil yes in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.729" end="01:48:07.330" style="s2">my book and I don&#39;t I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.860" end="01:48:09.909" style="s2">back away from the word evil probably</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.330" end="01:48:11.949" style="s2">committed by people who are mentally and</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.909" end="01:48:13.330" style="s2">psychologically damaged in fact our</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.949" end="01:48:16.360" style="s2">friend David Eagleman even gives the</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.330" end="01:48:18.130" style="s2">case of a guy who had no pedophilia no</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.360" end="01:48:19.719" style="s2">kind of feel like this desires until he</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.130" end="01:48:22.090" style="s2">developed a brain tumor and then</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.719" end="01:48:23.920" style="s2">suddenly had them and then the brain</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.090" end="01:48:25.389" style="s2">tumor was excised they went away then</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.920" end="01:48:27.010" style="s2">the pedophilia came back and they</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.389" end="01:48:30.429" style="s2">scanned the brain again there was a</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.010" end="01:48:32.800" style="s2">tumor so it&#39;s possible to destroy a life</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.429" end="01:48:34.389" style="s2">based on a weird physiology thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.800" end="01:48:36.909" style="s2">possible that these people are just sick</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.389" end="01:48:38.800" style="s2">evil horrible people I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.909" end="01:48:41.500" style="s2">it is I&#39;ll tell you what I do know ok I</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.800" end="01:48:44.560" style="s2">know that the activity that these people</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.500" end="01:48:47.440" style="s2">were engaged and was evil and I know</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.560" end="01:48:49.840" style="s2">that the techniques were entertaining</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.440" end="01:48:53.380" style="s2">because they were so destructive and</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.840" end="01:48:56.110" style="s2">vindictive so a lot of ethicists in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.380" end="01:48:58.630" style="s2">1990s and tooth and the 2000 said that</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.110" end="01:49:01.300" style="s2">it was akin to using a bazooka to kill a</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.630" end="01:49:03.310" style="s2">fly it was voyeuristic at project</p>

<p begin="01:49:05.290" end="01:49:10.030" style="s2">maybe it was the case that that was so</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.119" end="01:49:13.239" style="s2">terrifying that it actually stopped some</p>

<p begin="01:52:55.640" end="01:53:02.680" style="s2">problem that you have it an ostensibly</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.560" end="01:53:06.290" style="s2">and I hate the term left-of-centre media</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.680" end="01:53:08.690" style="s2">sort of a center-left oriented media</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.290" end="01:53:10.220" style="s2">that refuses to go after center-left</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.690" end="01:53:11.870" style="s2">counter-narrative stories and that would</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.220" end="01:53:14.120" style="s2">be a counter-narrative story so in other</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.870" end="01:53:17.990" style="s2">words I I think I can tell the tale</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.120" end="01:53:20.960" style="s2">which is each there is no news outfit</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.990" end="01:53:24.560" style="s2">that is so good that it can run counter</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.960" end="01:53:26.540" style="s2">narrative stories and there&#39;s no news</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.560" end="01:53:29.300" style="s2">outfit that&#39;s so inept that it can&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.540" end="01:53:31.010" style="s2">a story fairly that comes right down the</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.300" end="01:53:32.660" style="s2">center of its narrative and then the key</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.010" end="01:53:35.270" style="s2">question is what about the stories that</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.660" end="01:53:37.490" style="s2">are you know thirty percent oblique to</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.270" end="01:53:40.040" style="s2">the to the narrative or who knows what</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.490" end="01:53:45.260" style="s2">right so this is like the main problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.040" end="01:53:47.750" style="s2">so given that the major organs you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.260" end="01:53:49.310" style="s2">tend to be aligned with this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.750" end="01:53:50.660" style="s2">center-left perspective those stories</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.310" end="01:53:53.180" style="s2">don&#39;t get cut that they they live in the</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.660" end="01:53:56.140" style="s2">blind spot and so I understand why you</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.180" end="01:53:58.760" style="s2">do it and in part this is why I target</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.140" end="01:54:00.500" style="s2">the same group of people because my</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.760" end="01:54:02.450" style="s2">feeling is is that they are destroying</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.500" end="01:54:05.180" style="s2">the confidence now what really divides</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.450" end="01:54:07.190" style="s2">us is is that you and I have radically</p>

<p begin="01:54:07.190" end="01:54:12.980" style="s2">this problem and I&#39;m concerned that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:56:00.229" end="01:56:04.599" style="s2">clutters the issue and the issue is we</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.539" end="01:56:10.129" style="s2">know we have a bad person so for example</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.599" end="01:56:12.820" style="s2">Hitler gave there was a protest in the</p>

<p begin="01:56:45.469" end="01:56:49.010" style="s2">of the problem that we have is is that</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.479" end="01:56:51.619" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to acknowledge anything</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.010" end="01:56:54.919" style="s2">good about somebody we deemed to be bad</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.619" end="01:56:55.939" style="s2">but but the way our videos work is that</p>

<p begin="02:04:25.730" end="02:04:30.410" style="s2">our team had two days of conversations</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.790" end="02:04:33.470" style="s2">about do we blur the person&#39;s face to be</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.410" end="02:04:37.790" style="s2">a right your name we did all that and it</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.470" end="02:04:39.650" style="s2">and it comes down to a cliche which the</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.790" end="02:04:41.240" style="s2">Pam Zekman said in the 1970s which you</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.650" end="02:04:43.790" style="s2">have to balance the harm to the person</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.240" end="02:04:46.160" style="s2">with the with the weightiness of what is</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.790" end="02:04:47.630" style="s2">being exposed and internally you only</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.160" end="02:04:49.370" style="s2">have to do that on the efficient</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.630" end="02:04:52.160" style="s2">frontier do you understand the point if</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.370" end="02:04:53.330" style="s2">you&#39;re in an interior point you are not</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.160" end="02:04:55.220" style="s2">at the point where you have to balance</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.330" end="02:04:57.320" style="s2">those two things yet your first goal is</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.220" end="02:05:00.370" style="s2">to get to the efficient frontier and</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.320" end="02:05:02.870" style="s2">that&#39;s an issue of skill okay</p>

<p begin="02:05:02.870" end="02:05:06.530" style="s2">understand bridge of this concept for me</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.490" end="02:05:08.030" style="s2">efficient frontier Americana let&#39;s sing</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.530" end="02:05:10.580" style="s2">harm versus public importance right</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.030" end="02:05:12.920" style="s2">imagine for example that you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.580" end="02:05:14.360" style="s2">pixelated somebody&#39;s face but you could</p>

<p begin="02:05:16.940" end="02:05:21.740" style="s2">point is you don&#39;t yet have to balance</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.830" end="02:05:23.570" style="s2">the harm to the individual in fact you</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.740" end="02:05:25.640" style="s2">can even get a boost in both it could be</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.570" end="02:05:27.710" style="s2">that people say oh my god he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.640" end="02:05:29.300" style="s2">not to destroy the person he&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="02:05:31.220" end="02:05:36.290" style="s2">which I&#39;m really disturbed about and I</p>

<p begin="02:07:54.270" end="02:08:00.240" style="s2">is corrupt because you don&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="02:08:01.920" end="02:08:06.150" style="s2">already see this to me but to me this is</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.110" end="02:08:08.400" style="s2">directly connected to the premise that</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.150" end="02:08:11.460" style="s2">we&#39;re destroying people I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.400" end="02:08:13.770" style="s2">we&#39;re destroying David right and and I</p>

<p begin="02:08:22.620" end="02:08:26.040" style="s2">so then I don&#39;t need to grapple with</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.390" end="02:08:28.860" style="s2">that but what I&#39;m struggling with is I</p>
