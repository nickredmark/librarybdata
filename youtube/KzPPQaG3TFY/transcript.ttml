<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">love when I do that because it never</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">comes to anything but other things</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">that is exactly what happened but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">feels like in that group I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:14.420" style="s2">they&#39;re just like oh I think no it</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.520" end="00:02:19.880" style="s2">things always happen around it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.260" end="00:02:22.460" style="s2">the universe tells me to do something I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.880" end="00:02:24.290" style="s2">do it and then magic happens in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.460" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">ways which is why I keep listening to it</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">themselves and one delivered itself in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.370" end="00:02:42.709" style="s2">pretty strong way I hosted four</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">am working on a project to fight</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.729" end="00:04:42.530" style="s2">misinformation it&#39;s called wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:44.509" style="s2">and to start with it&#39;s focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.530" end="00:04:46.460" style="s2">fighting misinformation and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.509" end="00:04:49.909" style="s2">science and then it will expand out from</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.460" end="00:04:53.030" style="s2">there so my goal last week was to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.909" end="00:04:54.740" style="s2">some content to better explain where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.030" end="00:04:57.409" style="s2">things are at are very like I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.740" end="00:04:59.870" style="s2">the plans are for the part of it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.409" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">will discuss scientific studies and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.870" end="00:05:06.530" style="s2">articles in that type of thing because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:08.870" style="s2">think as we talked about last week one</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.530" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">of the next steps seems like it should</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.870" end="00:05:12.919" style="s2">be going to go to places like UBC</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">actually talking to some science you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.919" end="00:05:17.930" style="s2">know some ta some professors whoever</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:19.909" style="s2">will listen and just see if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.930" end="00:05:22.909" style="s2">some people who are interested in might</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.909" end="00:05:24.590" style="s2">want help answer some questions now to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.909" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">sort of plan out and then also people</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.590" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">who are interested in the long run to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:31.460" style="s2">actually do some of these article</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:32.509" style="s2">reviews and that type of thing actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.460" end="00:05:34.789" style="s2">did quite good</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.509" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">I got spent more than these three hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.789" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">that I wanted to and got I think three</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:43.969" style="s2">or four pretty good pieces of content</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:47.090" style="s2">they don&#39;t look all that nice but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.969" end="00:05:49.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the goal anyway and that did</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.090" end="00:05:51.289" style="s2">uncover now that I&#39;m getting deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.610" end="00:05:54.469" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to get more complex to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.289" end="00:05:56.210" style="s2">explain starting to wonder if it makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.469" end="00:05:58.909" style="s2">sense to explain it all sort of under</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.210" end="00:06:01.279" style="s2">one umbrella or if it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.909" end="00:06:02.930" style="s2">split them for now to sort of have like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.279" end="00:06:05.479" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s focusing on politics</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.930" end="00:06:08.870" style="s2">and elections and and that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.479" end="00:06:13.370" style="s2">and then one channel that focus is on</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.870" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">the scientific discussion part of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.370" end="00:06:17.659" style="s2">that will end up branching out into</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:20.090" style="s2">things like economics and legislation</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.659" end="00:06:24.909" style="s2">but sort of experts or at least the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.090" end="00:06:24.909" style="s2">skilled discussing complex topics</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.020" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">that&#39;s where our that something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">you&#39;re done which doesn&#39;t happen in our</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:36.710" style="s2">family just keep talking to the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.930" end="00:06:38.390" style="s2">person I could I know no because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.710" end="00:06:40.730" style="s2">also a piece of it is remembering to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.390" end="00:06:43.460" style="s2">stop talking other people can start who</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.730" end="00:06:44.480" style="s2">are comfortable instructing oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.460" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">the thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.480" end="00:06:50.450" style="s2">interesting interesting real-world you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">probably work on interrupting more no</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.450" end="00:06:54.230" style="s2">why do we have to change they should</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">learn how to jump in jump in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.230" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">mid-sentence that&#39;s what it finish the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:01.220" style="s2">thought for them and continue on this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:02.270" style="s2">how we play off each other well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.220" end="00:07:07.070" style="s2">have to figure that out if a third</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.270" end="00:07:09.020" style="s2">person joins us yeah how was your week</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.070" end="00:07:10.730" style="s2">been how was it to sit down and do it I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.020" end="00:07:14.540" style="s2">did it was it like all one big go for</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.730" end="00:07:17.420" style="s2">three hours plus I can&#39;t usually do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.540" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">and almost anything it&#39;s it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.420" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">like two different half-hour sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:23.420" style="s2">know throwing spaghetti at the wall and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:26.300" style="s2">trying to see like what makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.420" end="00:07:28.550" style="s2">thinking through it and then once I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.300" end="00:07:30.410" style="s2">actually got going I already know spent</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.550" end="00:07:32.840" style="s2">an hour once where I sort of started to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.410" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">make some stuff and then the next night</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.840" end="00:07:36.590" style="s2">I spent like I don&#39;t know two hours</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:38.290" style="s2">maybe three hours and then they I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.590" end="00:07:48.710" style="s2">like the best sleep I&#39;ve had in weeks</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.290" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">like but is there anything you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.710" end="00:07:53.720" style="s2">work on like I mean not just the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:57.290" style="s2">goal-setting but that I can help let you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.720" end="00:08:00.920" style="s2">just brainstorming how some part of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.290" end="00:08:03.260" style="s2">is that the idea of does it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.920" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">to split this into different and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.260" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">calling it brands cuz you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:11.750" style="s2">way to sort of put a face to I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">organization is the right word but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.750" end="00:08:15.020" style="s2">better ones not and not to come into</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:16.700" style="s2">mind the end goal is they&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.020" end="00:08:19.400" style="s2">being a part of the same thing it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.700" end="00:08:21.470" style="s2">of two sides of the same coin where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.400" end="00:08:24.380" style="s2">politics side is really more about like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.470" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">creating a background for people in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.380" end="00:08:27.500" style="s2">you know years down the road it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:28.940" style="s2">likely be more than just politicians</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.500" end="00:08:30.950" style="s2">it&#39;ll be people who claim to be experts</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.940" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be scientists journalists</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.950" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">people who you want to see like what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:37.550" style="s2">this person doing over the long run what</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:39.260" style="s2">kind of stuff are they doing who who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.550" end="00:08:40.400" style="s2">paying them where does their money come</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.260" end="00:08:41.810" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.400" end="00:08:44.210" style="s2">you know does the community find they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.810" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">lean one way or the other that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.210" end="00:08:49.520" style="s2">thing so that it&#39;s not to say if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:51.830" style="s2">that bad or that we filter it out but</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.520" end="00:08:54.140" style="s2">it&#39;s that any work that person does you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.830" end="00:08:56.330" style="s2">have you have some context to previous</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.140" end="00:08:57.770" style="s2">report that that person has done things</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.330" end="00:09:00.950" style="s2">things they&#39;ve been right or wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.770" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">that kind of thing and on the content</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:05.210" style="s2">side it&#39;s all about well sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">understanding complex topics like</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.210" end="00:09:11.890" style="s2">science economics</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:14.420" style="s2">legislation getting feedback from</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.890" end="00:09:17.540" style="s2">variety of sources see where they agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.420" end="00:09:20.530" style="s2">and disagree and then ideally boiling</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:23.230" style="s2">that up</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.530" end="00:09:26.780" style="s2">summarizing it at sort of a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.230" end="00:09:28.520" style="s2">so you can see if there&#39;s ten studies on</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.780" end="00:09:30.740" style="s2">the same topic what do they agree on</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.520" end="00:09:33.290" style="s2">what do they not agree on you know are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.740" end="00:09:34.850" style="s2">the ones that all agree and disagree it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.290" end="00:09:37.640" style="s2">is one of those groups have particularly</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.850" end="00:09:39.380" style="s2">bad you know where their experiments not</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.640" end="00:09:42.530" style="s2">designed properly if you have sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.380" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">funding it&#39;s to stuff like that so they</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.530" end="00:09:47.660" style="s2">start out sounding fairly different and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:49.310" style="s2">I think that to start with people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.660" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">are interested in wanting to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.310" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">would be different people in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:55.190" style="s2">they might be the same but largely</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:57.290" style="s2">you&#39;re having people who are super</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.190" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">interested in politics and making sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.290" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">people have useful information during</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:06.050" style="s2">elections now on the other side is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:09.250" style="s2">trying to sort of help solve did deus</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.050" end="00:10:11.510" style="s2">information in in to start with in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.250" end="00:10:15.460" style="s2">science by actually getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.510" end="00:10:19.460" style="s2">weeds and reviewing individual studies</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.460" end="00:10:20.960" style="s2">ya know and for both them like for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.460" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">politicians in particular you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.960" end="00:10:25.730" style="s2">able to have like the IBD the background</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">of the politician and same with in</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:29.720" style="s2">science like what is a scientist done</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:30.890" style="s2">who funds them where what universe do</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:32.810" style="s2">they go to what&#39;s their background and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.890" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">then there&#39;s also that another another</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.810" end="00:10:37.130" style="s2">layer of like the crowd that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:39.410" style="s2">participating whether they have a degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.130" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">or not is a piece of information but</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.410" end="00:10:44.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not as important as do they get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:47.900" style="s2">right do they do they understand the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.540" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">stuff beyond what are they in the box of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.900" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">being able to have a degree from</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">seizures yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:56.949" style="s2">I think in the early stages we just</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:58.810" style="s2">focus on like public experts and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.949" end="00:11:02.889" style="s2">the community can vote but the end goal</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.810" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">is to let anybody contribute and then it</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.889" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">becomes all about okay but are they</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">right yeah you have to have a PhD or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:11.139" style="s2">if they get ninety five percent of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.860" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">predictions and things they did they say</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.139" end="00:11:16.649" style="s2">end up you know everyone either true</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.649" end="00:11:21.639" style="s2">yeah no those are important and so also</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:23.529" style="s2">you just talked about branding and split</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.639" end="00:11:25.389" style="s2">it apart I think the other thing also is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.529" end="00:11:28.089" style="s2">even naming it right it&#39;s called wiki</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.389" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">elections which definitely goes to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.089" end="00:11:32.889" style="s2">politics and then figuring out what how</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:35.500" style="s2">to empower that right how to empower the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.889" end="00:11:38.260" style="s2">voter for the politician including an</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.500" end="00:11:39.940" style="s2">angel with the election as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.260" end="00:11:41.889" style="s2">kind of name that for two purposes one</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.940" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a wiki on election so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.889" end="00:11:45.699" style="s2">politics but but there&#39;s also a wiki</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:47.260" style="s2">powered by elections because people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.699" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">voting on you know what&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.260" end="00:11:52.209" style="s2">what&#39;s not and it was like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:53.769" style="s2">they&#39;re submitting information and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.209" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">whole idea is that one particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.769" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">well-spoken person can&#39;t take over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.779" style="s2">conversation because they&#39;re in heavy</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:02.230" style="s2">conversations with words they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.779" end="00:12:03.579" style="s2">it with data or I guess through data the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.230" end="00:12:04.990" style="s2">you can read things people can vote on</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.579" end="00:12:07.569" style="s2">if a certain thing is true or not and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.990" end="00:12:09.880" style="s2">then when that happens enough at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.569" end="00:12:13.620" style="s2">lower level you start to learn things at</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.880" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">the higher levels and people are are</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.620" end="00:12:18.699" style="s2">submitting news articles and how a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.290" style="s2">certain politician and voted that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.699" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2">can vote on so for example how a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.290" end="00:12:24.670" style="s2">politician voted you would vote on what</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:26.500" style="s2">that legislation means is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.670" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">pro-environment is it pro-business is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.500" end="00:12:33.069" style="s2">Pro it you know where they just rights</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:34.839" style="s2">that kind of thing and then if people</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.069" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">vote for or against it you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.839" end="00:12:39.220" style="s2">see the the way they lean you can start</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.970" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">to see what they value and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.220" end="00:12:42.279" style="s2">trying to say right or wrong it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.420" end="00:12:44.260" style="s2">saying here&#39;s the values that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.279" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">community seems to think that the this</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.260" end="00:12:49.180" style="s2">person has mhm you know there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">different iterations that it can take</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:51.310" style="s2">this thing we&#39;ve had this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:12:54.430" style="s2">before I know I&#39;ve had it with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.310" end="00:12:57.100" style="s2">people of like creating a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.430" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">politics game so that like feeds into</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.100" end="00:13:00.250" style="s2">the system where like you pick your</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:01.899" style="s2">politician you see are they gonna and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">it&#39;s just as simple as do they vote with</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.899" end="00:13:05.110" style="s2">their constituents right you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:08.230" style="s2">therefore you have to pull</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.110" end="00:13:09.820" style="s2">all constituents and then they just vote</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.230" end="00:13:12.579" style="s2">and you either get one so they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.820" end="00:13:14.860" style="s2">points but unlike fantasy football and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.579" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">hockey and everything else it actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.860" end="00:13:19.720" style="s2">affects the game right like I chose how</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:21.370" style="s2">much I don&#39;t play sports Gretzky is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.720" end="00:13:22.779" style="s2">gonna play hockey better how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.370" end="00:13:24.579" style="s2">played it like thirty years they</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.779" end="00:13:27.610" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t play hockey better because</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.579" end="00:13:30.279" style="s2">people have him on his 13 but I but</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.610" end="00:13:32.230" style="s2">politicians can and should vote better</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.279" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">based on oh I have to vote with my</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.230" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">constituents to get more points right it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:36.459" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen if there&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">people playing but if there were a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.459" end="00:13:39.399" style="s2">million people played it became the new</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">Pokemon go and you create in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.399" end="00:13:43.720" style="s2">it&#39;s fun interesting then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">crowd to kind of feed into the system</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.720" end="00:13:48.279" style="s2">you need to create it first and get will</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:50.890" style="s2">sell it like it&#39;s hard yeah exactly get</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.279" end="00:13:52.420" style="s2">bigger it it gets more clout the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.890" end="00:13:55.480" style="s2">part of that that&#39;s sort of an easier</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.420" end="00:13:59.260" style="s2">step is people tend to get elected on</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.480" end="00:14:01.240" style="s2">what they promised and that&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.260" end="00:14:03.820" style="s2">cutting dry words here&#39;s the things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.240" end="00:14:05.950" style="s2">they promised it&#39;s also keeping a track</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.820" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">record of that everybody that one okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.950" end="00:14:09.790" style="s2">how far along are they how much have</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:12.550" style="s2">they actually moved towards that what</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.790" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">have they done sometimes they push hard</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.550" end="00:14:15.880" style="s2">and trying to deliver it they actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">do a pretty good job sometimes they push</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.880" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">hard to deliver their promises and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:21.269" style="s2">they&#39;re stonewalled and sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:23.829" style="s2">just get elected on a promise and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.269" end="00:14:25.260" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem to guide their actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.829" end="00:14:27.699" style="s2">policy and office at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.260" end="00:14:29.890" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s you know being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.699" end="00:14:31.690" style="s2">that the next time around so that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.890" end="00:14:33.670" style="s2">says okay well this person&#39;s platform is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.690" end="00:14:36.310" style="s2">good but I can see in the past they only</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.670" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2">don&#39;t deliver on 12% of their promises</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.310" end="00:14:38.380" style="s2">maybe actually take it with a grain of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:40.810" style="s2">salt</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.380" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">yeah obviously this is not quite related</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.810" end="00:14:47.860" style="s2">but we went to to the local mall here on</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">Tuesday and it&#39;s it&#39;s a very high-end</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.860" end="00:14:52.839" style="s2">mall with a lot of high-end stores in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:54.430" style="s2">it also has been here since the late</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.839" end="00:14:56.260" style="s2">eighties early nineties so it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.430" end="00:14:58.540" style="s2">just they&#39;re updating it and so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.260" end="00:15:00.010" style="s2">have in that in they have like a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.540" end="00:15:01.390" style="s2">section it used to be sellers they found</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.010" end="00:15:03.310" style="s2">turned into a showroom and it&#39;s actually</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.620" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">this giant round swing that I&#39;m like can</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.839" end="00:15:13.690" style="s2">we are those gonna actually be there</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:15.449" style="s2">because I want them to be there but</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.690" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">they&#39;re going through the cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.449" end="00:15:18.550" style="s2">getting it through the city I know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:20.170" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.550" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">and this was we promised it to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.170" end="00:15:23.320" style="s2">we wanted it the city was like no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:24.340" style="s2">not gonna want that you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.320" end="00:15:26.110" style="s2">want to be close to your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.340" end="00:15:28.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna want those trees but</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.110" end="00:15:29.650" style="s2">you have to have these trees so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.150" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">a part that&#39;s like the bureaucracy of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.650" end="00:15:32.980" style="s2">the city that stops you and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:34.330" style="s2">the piece of oh you were never actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.980" end="00:15:36.490" style="s2">going to do that anyway and for this</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.330" end="00:15:38.290" style="s2">bigger texture project but it&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.490" end="00:15:40.270" style="s2">say you have this like they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.290" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">the second biggest library in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.270" end="00:15:43.090" style="s2">they&#39;ll have to fulfill that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:44.380" style="s2">way they&#39;re going to be able to not</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.090" end="00:15:46.750" style="s2">fulfill that to get that through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.380" end="00:15:49.420" style="s2">city but that Park might change right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:50.770" style="s2">the that it&#39;s on a rooftop that only</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.420" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">certain people can access and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.770" end="00:15:54.820" style="s2">actually have amazing rooftop gardens</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:15:56.410" style="s2">are they gonna make them accessible are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.820" end="00:15:58.090" style="s2">they gonna make it that you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.410" end="00:15:59.860" style="s2">know I don&#39;t buy something them all to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.090" end="00:16:02.440" style="s2">get out there or those kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.860" end="00:16:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to be like oh we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.440" end="00:16:06.520" style="s2">have the funding for that so we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.880" end="00:16:07.630" style="s2">do it wait you&#39;re a for-profit mall if</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.520" end="00:16:09.070" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re gonna fund</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.630" end="00:16:11.080" style="s2">those things that&#39;s part of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.070" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">part of using this face and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.080" end="00:16:15.940" style="s2">getting to stop traffic for those years</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.460" style="s2">well it builds and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.940" end="00:16:20.110" style="s2">they&#39;re using more space but that same</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.460" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">kind of thing right it&#39;s an architecture</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.110" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">project they&#39;re not even but to say this</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.950" style="s2">is what it&#39;s gonna be and then get it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:28.660" style="s2">through the system versus what is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.950" end="00:16:30.550" style="s2">actually gonna look like at the end and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.660" end="00:16:32.590" style="s2">if we had a similar project what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.550" end="00:16:34.540" style="s2">doing for all of the times that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.590" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">happened in the past we can see your</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.540" end="00:16:38.950" style="s2">construction company actually doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:41.710" style="s2">deliver yours doesn&#39;t seem that pros yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.950" end="00:16:43.300" style="s2">and so now if you do that a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.710" end="00:16:44.980" style="s2">times it starts to be even just during</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.300" end="00:16:47.590" style="s2">the proposal phase you&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.980" end="00:16:49.960" style="s2">great deck we know you&#39;re liars go away</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:52.120" style="s2">this other company has half the you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.960" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">their proposals have is good but they</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.120" end="00:16:56.650" style="s2">deliver so I&#39;d rather have 100% of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">they actually say we&#39;re gonna do then 1%</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.650" end="00:17:01.090" style="s2">of what you say you&#39;re gonna do so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:02.980" style="s2">absolutely not it&#39;s a big piece of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.090" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">what I sit with in my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.980" end="00:17:07.450" style="s2">development if I like some people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:08.830" style="s2">over estimators and some people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.450" end="00:17:10.300" style="s2">under estimators and I don&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.830" end="00:17:12.580" style="s2">it&#39;s about lying or not lying but our</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.300" end="00:17:14.350" style="s2">society props up the people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.580" end="00:17:15.010" style="s2">overestimate and like oh I have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.350" end="00:17:17.200" style="s2">trovato</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.010" end="00:17:18.940" style="s2">and downplays the other one we should do</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.200" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">the opposite right if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.940" end="00:17:23.260" style="s2">constantly able to come off is really</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:25.180" style="s2">amazing but they don&#39;t deliver on</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.260" end="00:17:26.800" style="s2">anything I&#39;d rather have the person that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.180" end="00:17:28.420" style="s2">like is going to over deliver on what</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.800" end="00:17:30.270" style="s2">they promised right well I&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.420" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">get a mess up but I&#39;ll get a tea</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.270" end="00:17:35.400" style="s2">that awesome I want that person who can</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">own it yet that person&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.400" end="00:17:39.270" style="s2">what it seems like they&#39;re sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">know that the personal goals and values</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.270" end="00:17:43.530" style="s2">are because then it seems like okay if</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:45.870" style="s2">this person did delivers on spending 5%</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.530" end="00:17:49.380" style="s2">of the things they promised great which</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.870" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">75% is it the one cost of the least</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:17.430" style="s2">yeah but the big bill that actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.990" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">mattered you didn&#39;t do anything towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.430" end="00:18:20.970" style="s2">so yeah and with like what are people</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.150" end="00:18:43.620" style="s2">great that he did it but that wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.610" end="00:18:46.410" style="s2">it was an electoral reform it was all it</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.620" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">was First Nations regularly like all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.410" end="00:18:52.530" style="s2">it he didn&#39;t flicker on anything would</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:56.670" style="s2">yeah but you know not to get reelected</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.530" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">again after that that&#39;s the way the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.670" end="00:19:00.690" style="s2">winds were blowing anyway so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:02.190" style="s2">like that&#39;s terribly a society governed</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.690" end="00:19:04.530" style="s2">by marketing and that&#39;s exactly it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.190" end="00:19:06.390" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy you can just promise it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.530" end="00:19:08.010" style="s2">you can just say it and then never</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.390" end="00:19:09.900" style="s2">deliver on it in marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.010" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">advertising and all of it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.900" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">more were able to back that up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.830" style="s2">actual data we can use in my world I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:19.830" style="s2">like that to be co-owned and transparent</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.830" end="00:19:21.660" style="s2">but even if it&#39;s not just how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.830" end="00:19:24.090" style="s2">trust it and how do we get that like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.660" end="00:19:25.260" style="s2">for-profit company can absolutely make</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.090" end="00:19:27.420" style="s2">this wiki elections that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.260" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">you&#39;re making it under under that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.420" end="00:19:31.260" style="s2">guideline as long as it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">about right but what are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.260" end="00:19:35.000" style="s2">the voting information that&#39;s publicly</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">available you&#39;re just using it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.000" end="00:19:39.420" style="s2">of what you&#39;re getting from the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.100" style="s2">is more trustworthy the more we own it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.420" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">together and the more we run it together</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.100" end="00:19:47.640" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the future vision of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:48.900" style="s2">if it&#39;s better under under public</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.640" end="00:19:52.190" style="s2">ownership is wrong because that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.900" end="00:19:57.450" style="s2">the government operative ownership</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.190" end="00:20:00.360" style="s2">improves it at that point yeah projects</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.450" end="00:20:03.780" style="s2">look behind the marketing and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.360" end="00:20:05.370" style="s2">politics and that is people I mean in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.780" end="00:20:06.870" style="s2">way they have short attention spans but</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.370" end="00:20:08.520" style="s2">that&#39;s you know people have lives they</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.870" end="00:20:10.100" style="s2">hear something like yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.520" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">good I&#39;ll vote for the information</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.100" end="00:20:14.550" style="s2">available and then they move on with</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:16.530" style="s2">their lives I don&#39;t even now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.550" end="00:20:18.060" style="s2">remember all the promises people made in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.530" end="00:20:24.780" style="s2">this past election and it was what a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.060" end="00:20:25.740" style="s2">month ago yeah so that two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.780" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.740" end="00:20:34.410" style="s2">I voted because I yeah I like to vote on</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:35.910" style="s2">the day of just because I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.410" end="00:20:40.140" style="s2">part of something it&#39;s the closest I get</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.910" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">to a sporting event I wish I could care</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.140" end="00:20:44.850" style="s2">about these sports as much as you people</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:46.830" style="s2">do it looks really fun I don&#39;t I know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.850" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been this it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.830" end="00:20:51.960" style="s2">ten years since thank you for happy</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:54.540" style="s2">Olympics like I&#39;m never walking around</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.960" end="00:20:56.340" style="s2">the city you be like I wish why are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.540" end="00:20:58.530" style="s2">but also can you care about anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.340" end="00:21:01.080" style="s2">else this just a fraction of this much</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.530" end="00:21:02.760" style="s2">just a fraction and to be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.080" end="00:21:04.560" style="s2">those together to be able to tap into</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.760" end="00:21:06.210" style="s2">why do people care about sports and how</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.560" end="00:21:08.700" style="s2">do you make it fun and interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.210" end="00:21:10.650" style="s2">engaging to care about politics because</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.700" end="00:21:13.980" style="s2">they also well they&#39;re promising these</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.650" end="00:21:16.620" style="s2">platforms also kind of almost make it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.980" end="00:21:19.080" style="s2">boring and and the data yeah arduous</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.620" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">right so I do wonder how much sports</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.080" end="00:21:25.020" style="s2">would die out if they had like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">if ESPN and I&#39;m forgetting a Sports</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.020" end="00:21:28.470" style="s2">Center those different things I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:31.890" style="s2">assume there but if they if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.470" end="00:21:33.300" style="s2">reported wildly different on games well</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.890" end="00:21:35.070" style="s2">you know they&#39;re like hey the Lakers</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.300" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">played the Spurs at one says the Lakers</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.070" end="00:21:38.730" style="s2">101 says it&#39;s personal and they show</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:40.020" style="s2">different highlights and I think after a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.730" end="00:21:41.640" style="s2">while people be like this is stupid</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.020" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what actually happened I</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.640" end="00:21:45.750" style="s2">think that&#39;s out yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.950" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">I think that&#39;s part of the issue with</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.750" end="00:21:49.320" style="s2">politics is it&#39;s really hard to follow</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to like most people know</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.320" end="00:21:54.179" style="s2">they&#39;re probably not getting the full</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:57.299" style="s2">truth no matter what source they go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.179" end="00:21:58.740" style="s2">that gets frustrating and people even</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.299" end="00:22:00.659" style="s2">the people that are interested end up</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.740" end="00:22:02.820" style="s2">losing interest because they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.659" end="00:22:04.169" style="s2">what the next step is and like they know</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:07.139" style="s2">that they&#39;re kind of rolling dice either</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.169" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">way so if you actually had a shared news</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.139" end="00:22:11.490" style="s2">source that was time crowd-sourced</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:13.950" style="s2">yeah which is great I mean having a tool</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.490" end="00:22:15.509" style="s2">that actually says are you telling the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.950" end="00:22:17.249" style="s2">truth what is what is it what is your</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.509" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">background in real time well it&#39;s odd</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.249" end="00:22:20.879" style="s2">like an add-on on Chrome while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:24.749" style="s2">watching yet on ESPN but the political</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.879" end="00:22:26.369" style="s2">ones is important and something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.749" end="00:22:28.619" style="s2">honestly although they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.369" end="00:22:29.999" style="s2">getting on Facebook to create that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.619" end="00:22:31.529" style="s2">not going to trust into Facebook great</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.999" end="00:22:33.149" style="s2">so we need to create it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.529" end="00:22:35.070" style="s2">something that we can transparently see</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.149" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">and put on and so we&#39;re a sourcing it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.070" end="00:22:41.369" style="s2">right the people in it if we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:43.590" style="s2">trusting that that person talking is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.369" end="00:22:45.119" style="s2">telling the truth people won&#39;t trust it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.590" end="00:22:46.499" style="s2">like words on YouTube on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.119" end="00:22:48.869" style="s2">whether they&#39;re zooming it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.499" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">whether it&#39;s on CNN if they just let</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.869" end="00:22:53.279" style="s2">people you know vomit words and just</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">like well I&#39;m doing my job by</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.279" end="00:22:58.230" style="s2">broadcasting this and my job is done</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:23:02.249" style="s2">yeah why why I listen to this why not</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.230" end="00:23:04.499" style="s2">just broadcast a white wall and it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.249" end="00:23:06.869" style="s2">we have eroded the trust of the public</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.499" end="00:23:09.119" style="s2">in advertising in politics and economics</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.869" end="00:23:11.309" style="s2">and law in cardial and everything I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.119" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">eroded it so now it&#39;s like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.309" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">kind of up your game and Trust just to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:18.509" style="s2">break even and yet like nobody trusts it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:19.950" style="s2">which is my issue with like crypto</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.509" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">currencies people like look at it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.950" end="00:23:25.110" style="s2">awesome I&#39;m like yes it might be it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:27.029" style="s2">might be our solution to everything but</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.110" end="00:23:28.919" style="s2">we already don&#39;t understand the currency</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.029" end="00:23:30.450" style="s2">we&#39;re using and don&#39;t trust it it has to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.919" end="00:23:32.490" style="s2">be more understandable and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.450" end="00:23:34.259" style="s2">trustworthy than what we have in order</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.490" end="00:23:36.450" style="s2">to overtake it I think the same can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.259" end="00:23:38.970" style="s2">said for all of these technology and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.450" end="00:23:40.919" style="s2">apps is currency exchange here in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.970" end="00:23:42.659" style="s2">Vancouver that nickel is a store of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.919" end="00:23:44.190" style="s2">something a code like 70 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.659" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">you could cook every currency and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:48.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like sorry guys have walked away ya</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:49.649" style="s2">know and the more that those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.119" end="00:23:51.629" style="s2">happen the less you&#39;re gonna trust you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.649" end="00:23:54.119" style="s2">know like even this isn&#39;t quite for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.629" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">trust trust but like if you have you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.119" end="00:23:57.869" style="s2">because there have been future political</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:23:59.669" style="s2">ops right and the more they come into</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.869" end="00:24:01.799" style="s2">existence then go out people are like</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.669" end="00:24:02.820" style="s2">all participating for years we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.799" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">successful right</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.820" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">instead of like right but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:09.429" style="s2">bring people on and it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.970" end="00:24:11.350" style="s2">cessful like so it hurts itself and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.429" end="00:24:13.299" style="s2">you&#39;re like well I&#39;m not gonna touch it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.350" end="00:24:15.490" style="s2">if Google creates one but it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.299" end="00:24:17.620" style="s2">way it&#39;s gonna be successful we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:19.870" style="s2">breaking it ourselves before we find it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.620" end="00:24:22.270" style="s2">and so we have to be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.870" end="00:24:23.799" style="s2">people on board find the trust and say</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.270" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">well what would get you to trust it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.799" end="00:24:28.539" style="s2">right how can you trust me how can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:29.799" style="s2">trust the system and build that into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.539" end="00:24:32.260" style="s2">I think this is a big piece of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.799" end="00:24:33.580" style="s2">doing it openly and honestly where you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.260" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">know they mean like they can see you and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.580" end="00:24:37.780" style="s2">see her a real person who has and your</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.250" style="s2">real goals and it comes at a cost</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.780" end="00:24:42.429" style="s2">right people make fun of you who people</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.250" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">can like remind you wrong one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.429" end="00:24:45.730" style="s2">things that I think I can&#39;t escape which</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:47.289" style="s2">of not terribly looking forward to but</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.730" end="00:24:49.150" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the world that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.289" end="00:24:50.860" style="s2">trying to create is I&#39;m gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.150" end="00:24:52.330" style="s2">have my own page on wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.860" end="00:24:55.480" style="s2">everything that I say goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.330" end="00:24:58.179" style="s2">same scrutiny as every minute what else</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.480" end="00:24:59.470" style="s2">so when certain you know when things</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.179" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">come out people say it&#39;s unfair like</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.470" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">well I have my page on there too so my</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:08.020" style="s2">husband is a nice no saying some</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:11.470" style="s2">relevant things after his last thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.020" end="00:25:14.650" style="s2">citizen should be able to select service</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.470" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">has access to that data but no own it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.650" end="00:25:18.220" style="s2">their servers I agree but that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.750" end="00:25:19.539" style="s2">gonna happen in our Google or if it does</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.220" end="00:25:21.130" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take a lot of years but and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.539" end="00:25:22.570" style="s2">we can create that we can create our</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.130" end="00:25:24.429" style="s2">version of Google that actually does</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">that which is our Nestor knows were</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.429" end="00:25:28.809" style="s2">there any kind of you one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:32.140" style="s2">challenges that I think all face with</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.809" end="00:25:35.049" style="s2">this project is security at like is one</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.140" end="00:25:37.510" style="s2">of the the tenants of it which does</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.049" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">restrict transparency in certain areas</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.510" end="00:25:41.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s finding that balance between</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.250" end="00:25:42.429" style="s2">being transparent but then also not</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.140" end="00:25:45.159" style="s2">being overly transparent where it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.429" end="00:25:47.220" style="s2">becomes a security risk because I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.159" end="00:25:51.690" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that if this is successful</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.220" end="00:25:54.429" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be the target of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.690" end="00:25:55.809" style="s2">influences yeah well your instance</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.429" end="00:25:57.669" style="s2">people trying to spend money on it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.809" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">people trying to hack it people trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.669" end="00:26:01.929" style="s2">to just you know hire attend s of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:03.610" style="s2">to come in there and add garbage data</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.929" end="00:26:06.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.610" end="00:26:09.850" style="s2">will do to try and stop it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.280" end="00:26:11.169" style="s2">if it&#39;s it&#39;s successful a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.850" end="00:26:12.669" style="s2">are going to hate it it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.169" end="00:26:14.500" style="s2">absolutely that a lot of people is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.669" end="00:26:16.090" style="s2">to be less than 1% of people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.500" end="00:26:17.799" style="s2">still a lot of people and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.090" end="00:26:20.530" style="s2">powerful people with money and resources</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.799" end="00:26:22.810" style="s2">so it&#39;s so I think like transparent</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.530" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">see we have to own that security is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.810" end="00:26:27.010" style="s2">issue for sure transparency fixes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">of it like Wikipedia has those exact</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.010" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">same problems but they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:32.470" style="s2">not collectively owned and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:34.810" style="s2">really crowdsource</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.470" end="00:26:36.280" style="s2">the solution to the problem right all</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.810" end="00:26:37.570" style="s2">they can do is kind of lock it and come</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.280" end="00:26:38.530" style="s2">up with other solutions and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.570" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">this is what we&#39;re doing to the best of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.530" end="00:26:43.060" style="s2">our ability the more were able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:44.230" style="s2">crowdsource like right there&#39;s 2,000</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.060" end="00:26:46.630" style="s2">people that all came on and started</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.230" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2">voting the opposite way what are we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">doing about this how do we kind of let</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">like maybe freeze of those 2,000 well we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:55.060" style="s2">discuss how to how to fix that right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not if as long as that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.060" end="00:26:58.540" style="s2">done transparently it might not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:01.450" style="s2">perfect but it&#39;s better than allowing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.540" end="00:27:02.920" style="s2">Coke to come on and or do it for</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.450" end="00:27:05.920" style="s2">politics but probably they get involved</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.920" end="00:27:07.510" style="s2">in politics anyway like how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.920" end="00:27:10.060" style="s2">do you deal with that but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.510" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">the internet security piece of having</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.060" end="00:27:13.030" style="s2">the code available and having those</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.320" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">things and I get why for your project</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.030" end="00:27:17.980" style="s2">that might not be doable for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:19.660" style="s2">transparency is default not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.980" end="00:27:22.680" style="s2">transparency for transparency because</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.660" end="00:27:25.510" style="s2">transparency is the best all right I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.680" end="00:27:26.620" style="s2">agree with that and I would want to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.510" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">like as much of the source code</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.620" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">available and the underlying data but</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">with you know going through that layer</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:36.460" style="s2">of like sort of the the security for</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.200" style="s2">multiple angles because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.460" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">necessarily trust open source projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.200" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">like the results they create I do like</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">the fact that like if you&#39;re really into</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:45.970" style="s2">code you can go look at the code and see</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:47.560" style="s2">exactly what it&#39;s doing and see if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.970" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s weird if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.560" end="00:27:50.980" style="s2">sketchy stuff in there and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">thing which because it&#39;s open there</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.980" end="00:27:56.050" style="s2">tends not to be because anybody can open</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">it up and and take a look yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.050" end="00:28:00.130" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to find that balance yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:02.290" style="s2">absolutely and I think the a tech</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.130" end="00:28:03.970" style="s2">cooperative in a way gets that balance</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.290" end="00:28:04.870" style="s2">because it&#39;s if it&#39;s just open source</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.970" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">you might have both kind of shitty</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.870" end="00:28:09.130" style="s2">projects like Munsell as much as I like</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.450" style="s2">it the Mozilla people use Chrome when</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.130" end="00:28:13.090" style="s2">they&#39;re doing their work that says</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.450" end="00:28:15.280" style="s2">something that says something huge and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.090" end="00:28:17.140" style="s2">so we can have the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.280" end="00:28:19.480" style="s2">but just aren&#39;t like honoring just that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.140" end="00:28:21.850" style="s2">hey bugzilla employees why are using</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.480" end="00:28:24.550" style="s2">chrome how do we prove it until it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.850" end="00:28:26.710" style="s2">the state right where they&#39;re at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.550" end="00:28:29.500" style="s2">even is if they&#39;re even in their in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.710" end="00:28:31.480" style="s2">their speed I&#39;m using Mozilla but</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.500" end="00:28:33.470" style="s2">knowing that they they and this was from</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.480" end="00:28:35.900" style="s2">five years ago maybe they no longer you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.470" end="00:28:38.390" style="s2">problem I don&#39;t know but has Mozilla</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.900" end="00:28:40.280" style="s2">improved chrome house and so owning that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.390" end="00:28:42.500" style="s2">for-profit companies have an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.280" end="00:28:44.270" style="s2">in the improvement and innovation force</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.500" end="00:28:46.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean but they&#39;re also hurting</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.270" end="00:28:47.539" style="s2">our environment or social structure I do</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.220" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">think we can have the best of both</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.539" end="00:28:52.100" style="s2">worlds by just owning that by saying how</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:54.110" style="s2">do we improve it right if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.100" end="00:28:56.690" style="s2">Mozilla shittier than chrome how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.110" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">improve it yeah without just like use it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.690" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s better use it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:03.320" style="s2">socially just use it no is it better</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:05.090" style="s2">chrome is interesting because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.320" end="00:29:06.830" style="s2">Chrome which is the front end the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.090" end="00:29:08.570" style="s2">used to but then as chromium which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.830" end="00:29:10.580" style="s2">kind of like the platform that chrome is</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.570" end="00:29:12.980" style="s2">based on that now Opera is based on</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.510" end="00:30:46.170" style="s2">that on the politics part we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.299" end="00:30:48.120" style="s2">have to track the political parties</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.170" end="00:30:49.920" style="s2">because while I&#39;m not always a fan of</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.110" end="00:31:13.950" style="s2">them which is the irony of like if</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:15.990" style="s2">you&#39;re a liberal representation in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.950" end="00:31:17.430" style="s2">Canada you have to vote with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.990" end="00:31:19.500" style="s2">Liberals but you&#39;re still voting as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.430" end="00:31:21.000" style="s2">individual it&#39;s like wait really like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.500" end="00:31:22.050" style="s2">why not just vote as a bloc you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.000" end="00:31:24.030" style="s2">vote as a bloc yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.050" end="00:31:26.370" style="s2">where is reading the technology to track</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.030" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">them makes it so they might not vote as</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.370" end="00:31:28.680" style="s2">a bloc you know what I&#39;d rather be</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.980" style="s2">independent and work with my</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.680" end="00:31:34.770" style="s2">constituents then look under you even be</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.980" end="00:31:38.280" style="s2">funnier but so on that same side they</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.770" end="00:31:39.780" style="s2">way that we&#39;ll be tracking a political</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.280" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">party sort of the history of that seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.780" end="00:31:44.280" style="s2">how they trend but then also how the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.810" style="s2">members of that party so you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.280" end="00:31:47.880" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones actually contributing</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.810" end="00:31:49.890" style="s2">to the data for a tea party do the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.880" end="00:31:51.330" style="s2">thing for corporations here&#39;s the D</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.890" end="00:31:52.890" style="s2">decision this corporation made here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.330" end="00:31:55.170" style="s2">who was on the board here&#39;s you know who</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.890" end="00:31:58.530" style="s2">was involved in that decision so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.170" end="00:32:00.750" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re tracking the lowest highest</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.530" end="00:32:04.260" style="s2">exactly you know so that you can track</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:06.570" style="s2">the public personas involved in that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.260" end="00:32:09.240" style="s2">sort of the organization as a whole and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.570" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">how they interact you might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.240" end="00:32:13.560" style="s2">a part of a board that made a decision</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.180" style="s2">that people didn&#39;t like okay he voted</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.560" end="00:32:17.430" style="s2">against it so actually that person is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.180" end="00:32:20.040" style="s2">good yeah just because you were a part</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.430" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">and to go teach tear point hopefully in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.040" end="00:32:24.420" style="s2">politics that would have them vote how</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:26.010" style="s2">they actually feel they should and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.420" end="00:32:28.200" style="s2">know how their constituents feel that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.010" end="00:32:30.270" style="s2">they should instead of well this is how</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.200" end="00:32:32.460" style="s2">the party is voting so if I want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.270" end="00:32:35.460" style="s2">part of the next vote I have to vote to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.460" end="00:32:37.290" style="s2">put them absolutely and so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.460" end="00:32:38.910" style="s2">piece of like it feeding back into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.290" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">system if it&#39;s changing the system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.910" end="00:32:42.570" style="s2">looking at and same a science right oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.980" end="00:32:44.790" style="s2">wait they can tear this apart we better</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.570" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">make it even extra strong and so if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.790" end="00:32:47.190" style="s2">can&#39;t go back and do that to old ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:47.670" style="s2">but they can definitely do that for</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.190" end="00:32:50.220" style="s2">future ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:32:51.630" style="s2">so we&#39;re at the 33 minute mark or</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.220" end="00:32:53.400" style="s2">supposed to keep these kind of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.630" end="00:32:55.380" style="s2">to half an hour&#39;s so that people one</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.400" end="00:32:57.390" style="s2">might watch them it doesn&#39;t we know we</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.380" end="00:33:00.690" style="s2">can talk about this technology and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.390" end="00:33:03.480" style="s2">information and politics for hours on</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.690" end="00:33:05.010" style="s2">so we can wrap this up with what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.480" end="00:33:09.080" style="s2">want to commit to in the next week and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.010" end="00:33:13.170" style="s2">then say goodbye to YouTube all right um</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.080" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve torn between two things one is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.170" end="00:33:17.700" style="s2">update the prototype for the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">election part the sort of you know pick</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.700" end="00:33:23.880" style="s2">the top three popular candidates in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:25.620" style="s2">Democratic race in the US a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.880" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">update their page it&#39;s because things</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.620" end="00:33:28.800" style="s2">have changed and more information has</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">come out and you know they have varying</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.800" end="00:33:33.000" style="s2">levels of details on the different</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:37.410" style="s2">stances they actually start to record</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:39.960" style="s2">some of that data you know and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.410" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">want to answer guys I was right your</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.960" end="00:33:45.930" style="s2">neck guys Ernesto&#39;s conversation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:50.040" style="s2">just watching something in my case yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.930" end="00:33:51.150" style="s2">the plans for global scalability in my</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.040" end="00:33:53.640" style="s2">mind that&#39;s one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:56.010" style="s2">differences between wiki election and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.640" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">all these other projects the US has an</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.010" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">immense amount of really good</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:03.710" style="s2">information out there on politics part</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:05.130" style="s2">of it is that it sort of made by and for</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.710" end="00:34:07.080" style="s2">policy nerds</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.130" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">so they&#39;ll dive deep but they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.080" end="00:34:11.790" style="s2">people that kind of knew this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:12.929" style="s2">anyway and knew where to get it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.790" end="00:34:14.610" style="s2">only us-based</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.929" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">so part of it is to make it easy to</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.610" end="00:34:19.320" style="s2">understand but then a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:20.669" style="s2">making it global which means you know to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.320" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">start with it&#39;s going to be can to end</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.669" end="00:34:25.560" style="s2">the u.s. just because that&#39;s the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">that I know and that&#39;s it in English the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.560" end="00:34:30.659" style="s2">only language I speak but after that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">goals are very soon until you know start</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.659" end="00:34:34.620" style="s2">doing it in Spanish and Hindi and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:38.190" style="s2">bunch of other languages and start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.620" end="00:34:41.190" style="s2">get politicians and stuff from other</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.190" end="00:34:44.700" style="s2">areas a so that we can help out those</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.190" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">you know each individual country but</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.700" end="00:34:47.460" style="s2">also because there&#39;s people who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">have their hands and multiple PI&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.460" end="00:34:51.510" style="s2">across the globe people who have moved</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">from politics from Canada to the US or</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.820" end="00:35:50.260" style="s2">all weird usage spikes like during an</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">election season the usage will see at</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.260" end="00:35:55.210" style="s2">least tenfold and without a good way to</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.950" end="00:36:02.590" style="s2">for usage one of them is to identify the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.170" end="00:36:03.790" style="s2">areas or maybe you know like I talked</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.590" end="00:36:06.850" style="s2">about doing something like this for</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.790" end="00:36:10.120" style="s2">coops like van city well they have money</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.850" end="00:36:11.710" style="s2">to pay for it so you you give them some</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.120" end="00:36:13.390" style="s2">kind of a white labeled version is that</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.100" end="00:36:23.740" style="s2">then for things like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.420" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">neighborhood co-op they might not have</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.740" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">to pay or or if they do you know it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">budget and what their purpose is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">and then being for being scalable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:45.550" style="s2">there&#39;s the two sides of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:47.410" style="s2">the like initially it&#39;s going to be to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.550" end="00:36:48.910" style="s2">be built on something like it&#39;d be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.410" end="00:36:51.730" style="s2">Amazon Cloud because that&#39;s how you make</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.910" end="00:36:54.010" style="s2">it scalable and that&#39;s one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.730" end="00:36:58.840" style="s2">ways to prevent the easiest thing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.010" end="00:37:00.250" style="s2">disturb it which is DDoS or you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.840" end="00:37:02.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of computers kind of like</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.220" end="00:37:07.570" style="s2">computers dip bugs down but we do also</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.190" style="s2">need a backup in case Amazon decides</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.190" end="00:37:16.060" style="s2">us you know something this controversial</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:18.010" style="s2">on their servers you know it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.060" end="00:37:20.770" style="s2">beauty I hate that the tech has as much</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.010" end="00:37:22.540" style="s2">power as they do right now but also the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.770" end="00:37:26.170" style="s2">tech that has power Amazon Facebook</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.220" end="00:37:36.579" style="s2">like he&#39;s like and I also need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:38.890" style="s2">breathe air I also need a politics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.579" end="00:37:40.839" style="s2">political system like one they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.890" end="00:37:42.940" style="s2">come from backgrounds and backgrounds of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.839" end="00:37:44.650" style="s2">money right so they&#39;re they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.940" end="00:37:46.390" style="s2">human they still want to keep their</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.650" end="00:37:49.029" style="s2">slice of the pie but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.390" end="00:37:51.609" style="s2">they were brought like I think they get</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.029" end="00:37:52.839" style="s2">the planet and the issues more so than</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.609" end="00:37:54.309" style="s2">people who are like what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.839" end="00:37:56.410" style="s2">there&#39;s people starving and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.309" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">mean there&#39;s people like they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.410" end="00:38:00.250" style="s2">human beings still and I think but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:02.829" style="s2">would still plan for that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.250" end="00:38:04.059" style="s2">because you get enough people in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.829" end="00:38:07.210" style="s2">right state of mind of the wrong state</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.059" end="00:38:09.519" style="s2">of mind and yeah this is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.210" end="00:38:12.220" style="s2">going great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.519" end="00:38:14.109" style="s2">if tech wasn&#39;t tech like if Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.220" end="00:38:16.029" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as public as it was they&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.109" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">much more incentive to squash you right</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.029" end="00:38:20.920" style="s2">to squash me to be at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:23.079" style="s2">there&#39;s like people I see all the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.920" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">on YouTube dismantling capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.079" end="00:38:26.109" style="s2">they&#39;re not shutting down Richard Wolffe</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not shutting them down because</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.109" end="00:38:30.599" style="s2">they&#39;re giving the money right there</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:32.200" style="s2">like right those are eyeballs we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.599" end="00:38:35.259" style="s2">go for it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:37.930" style="s2">even talk smack about YouTube on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.259" end="00:38:39.630" style="s2">like they&#39;ll say I mean those still are</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.930" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">love and I think a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.630" end="00:38:45.430" style="s2">that yes I agree and I think of it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:47.410" style="s2">you can&#39;t be a tech company and not</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.430" end="00:38:49.779" style="s2">before innovation yeah you&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.410" end="00:38:51.579" style="s2">we think we should have stopped</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.779" end="00:38:53.349" style="s2">innovating in 2010 so we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.579" end="00:38:55.329" style="s2">to fight any innovation past that point</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.349" end="00:38:58.329" style="s2">it&#39;d be weird for a tech company exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.329" end="00:39:00.940" style="s2">their innovation and to your to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.329" end="00:39:03.880" style="s2">point because they&#39;re so public it would</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.940" end="00:39:05.230" style="s2">be a lot harder especially if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.880" end="00:39:07.210" style="s2">kind of a sweet spot where like in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.230" end="00:39:09.670" style="s2">early days before they get you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.210" end="00:39:11.759" style="s2">before the election got a bunch of users</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.670" end="00:39:14.500" style="s2">it would be possible to do it silently</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.759" end="00:39:15.910" style="s2">but then it wouldn&#39;t be on their radar</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.500" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of once it gets big enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.910" end="00:39:19.269" style="s2">to be on the radar it&#39;s too hard to shut</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.990" style="s2">down that&#39;s the beauty same with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.269" end="00:39:24.609" style="s2">tech cooperative yeah it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.990" end="00:39:26.529" style="s2">just that Amazon is so diversified that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.609" end="00:39:28.450" style="s2">they know one is considered competition</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.529" end="00:39:30.819" style="s2">I would agree the only one is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:32.049" style="s2">compete them is the globe like global</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.819" end="00:39:34.589" style="s2">citizens and the only way that happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.049" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">more too big to fail anyway right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.589" end="00:39:37.960" style="s2">Amazon&#39;s the last one we take on because</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:40.359" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.960" end="00:39:43.060" style="s2">people the funny thing is if like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.359" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">because they&#39;re so diversified right if</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.060" end="00:39:47.410" style="s2">they&#39;re Amazon Cloud if you know you put</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">this kind of a tool on there and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.410" end="00:39:50.830" style="s2">decide to fight that against it all of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:53.230" style="s2">sudden that becomes a pretty solid</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.830" end="00:39:55.210" style="s2">argument to break the company up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.230" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">like okay you&#39;re not trying to protect</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.210" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">your other businesses with this business</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:02.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not competing with the you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">with AWS yet you should have said down</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.380" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">on there when they&#39;re you know the best</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:08.170" style="s2">option et cetera that would be a really</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.570" style="s2">solid argument to start with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.170" end="00:40:14.050" style="s2">you know antitrust yes that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.570" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">starting anyway which yeah in there yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.050" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">absolutely okay so you&#39;re taking on</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:21.400" style="s2">updating the prototypes for the top</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">three democratic people right good luck</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.400" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">picking the top three oh I didn&#39;t Warren</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">and Burnie and everything I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.150" style="s2">they&#39;re the only ones pulling it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">double digits as far as I know unless</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.150" end="00:40:37.570" style="s2">alright yeah somebody snuck tough but</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:42.040" style="s2">even in they&#39;re probably still low and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.570" end="00:40:44.859" style="s2">they might be nice so interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.040" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">this in like the next we&#39;re Canadian by</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.859" end="00:40:52.060" style="s2">the way so weird by standards in the US</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">election we don&#39;t actually but like you</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.339" end="00:41:23.950" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:25.660" style="s2">look or does it do the opposite where</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.950" end="00:41:27.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like people with a big name they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.660" end="00:41:29.170" style="s2">gonna have boards at it like moored out</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.820" end="00:41:33.099" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily matter in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.170" end="00:41:35.230" style="s2">and at the same time right part of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.099" end="00:41:36.970" style="s2">challenge in something like this is how</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.230" end="00:41:40.359" style="s2">do you let somebody new come to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.970" end="00:41:41.619" style="s2">table if you have a lifetime of politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.359" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">and let&#39;s say you&#39;re good or bad or</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.619" end="00:41:46.359" style="s2">somewhere in the middle that least helps</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:49.330" style="s2">people to decide but if you were you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.359" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">know like somebody like Elizabeth Warren</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.330" end="00:41:53.170" style="s2">is fairly new to the game</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">like she was kind of involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.170" end="00:41:59.080" style="s2">visit the Consumer Financial Protection</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:42:00.250" style="s2">Bureau or whatever it was called as far</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.080" end="00:42:02.680" style="s2">as I know that was kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.250" end="00:42:05.620" style="s2">time she really entered that arena she</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.680" end="00:42:07.150" style="s2">kind of did dabbled on the outskirts but</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.620" end="00:42:09.610" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t really have a lethal a long</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.150" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">track record somebody like Bernie who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.610" end="00:42:14.020" style="s2">been doing it for years as a super long</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.470" end="00:42:16.780" style="s2">one from for somebody else that he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.020" end="00:42:18.670" style="s2">things outside of politics yes that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.780" end="00:42:21.310" style="s2">chicken arms as they he&#39;ll be good this</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.670" end="00:42:24.220" style="s2">and not good it&#39;s in here sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.310" end="00:42:27.330" style="s2">he values here&#39;s all the companies he</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.220" end="00:42:29.740" style="s2">bankrupted over the years yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.330" end="00:42:30.760" style="s2">with it all of it I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.740" end="00:42:32.380" style="s2">going to be things that people say about</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.760" end="00:42:34.360" style="s2">him to end up not being true and things</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.380" end="00:42:36.490" style="s2">that are true that no one&#39;s been saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.360" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s been hard to get traction</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.490" end="00:42:41.020" style="s2">on it and so starting to to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:43.150" style="s2">out and to get people on both sides I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.020" end="00:42:45.370" style="s2">going to face it like oh they&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.150" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">to say good things and bad things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.370" end="00:42:49.990" style="s2">not used to that usually it&#39;s so skewed</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:51.550" style="s2">one direction or or the other and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.990" end="00:42:54.790" style="s2">think just that is going to be a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.550" end="00:42:57.850" style="s2">shift for people all right mine I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.790" end="00:42:59.890" style="s2">gonna put out over the next I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.850" end="00:43:02.860" style="s2">out the doodle poll that Bentley created</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.890" end="00:43:04.840" style="s2">for asking game B people when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.860" end="00:43:09.640" style="s2">available to pick a time and then pick a</p>

<p begin="00:43:10.930" end="00:43:14.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet quite figure out how to pick</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.100" end="00:43:16.330" style="s2">the question to do that option to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.230" end="00:43:19.180" style="s2">on the weekend or evenings I mean I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:29.350" style="s2">eventually that&#39;s part of it is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.550" end="00:43:30.490" style="s2">having that feedback right right</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.350" end="00:43:32.110" style="s2">other people are more interested in</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.480" end="00:45:47.210" style="s2">community says are the most important oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.160" end="00:45:48.380" style="s2">look these three no one is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.210" end="00:45:49.940" style="s2">they haven&#39;t mentioned it in any</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.380" end="00:45:51.890" style="s2">political rallies they haven&#39;t mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.940" end="00:45:53.540" style="s2">it in the news no one&#39;s talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.890" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">but when you get enough users you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.540" end="00:45:57.710" style="s2">like hey three million people have been</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:46:00.440" style="s2">asking these questions the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.710" end="00:46:02.330" style="s2">that are willing to answer them all of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.440" end="00:46:03.800" style="s2">sudden that gives them a leg up busy</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.330" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">people who want an answer to these</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.800" end="00:46:05.960" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:07.460" style="s2">oh look only one of the three has</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.960" end="00:46:07.880" style="s2">answered that all right I&#39;ll keep that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.460" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">in mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.880" end="00:46:12.470" style="s2">and it becomes another channel where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">have to go and you know fill out these</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.470" end="00:46:17.150" style="s2">questions as the community agrees that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:18.589" style="s2">that are important</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.150" end="00:46:20.270" style="s2">which means you can&#39;t avoid the hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.589" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">questions that people in the media don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.270" end="00:46:23.299" style="s2">want to ask is maybe either it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:24.260" style="s2">embarrassing or it could cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.299" end="00:46:28.940" style="s2">lose money or it&#39;s bad for their</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.940" end="00:46:32.569" style="s2">filter it&#39;s just here&#39;s what he says</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.890" end="00:46:35.180" style="s2">they want to know who&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.569" end="00:46:36.619" style="s2">answer that question mm-hmm no and</p>
