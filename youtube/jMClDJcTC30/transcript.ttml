<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:24.619" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.430" end="00:00:35.809" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s just some check-ins do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.619" end="00:00:38.930" style="s2">wanna you want to go first sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.809" end="00:00:43.670" style="s2">feeling a little anxious it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.930" end="00:00:46.420" style="s2">anxiety that&#39;s sort of like coming in</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.670" end="00:00:49.570" style="s2">and going out it&#39;s like a like a wave</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.420" end="00:00:54.619" style="s2">moving in and out in and I have a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.570" end="00:00:58.760" style="s2">solid movement practice that is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.619" end="00:01:01.189" style="s2">reliable in moving that anxiety but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.760" end="00:01:05.689" style="s2">just sort of I&#39;m making peace at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.189" end="00:01:08.750" style="s2">fact that that like that latent anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.689" end="00:01:11.930" style="s2">I think is normal under the given</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.750" end="00:01:16.759" style="s2">circumstances hmm you know like two</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.930" end="00:01:20.510" style="s2">weeks to expect to feel grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.759" end="00:01:23.960" style="s2">happy and confident and energized all</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.510" end="00:01:26.150" style="s2">the time amidst like the current moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.960" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">of uncertainty I think is like that pill</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.150" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">that feels like a pipe dream right</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:34.040" style="s2">though so like making friends with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:36.409" style="s2">anxiety and fear I think is tip to me a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.040" end="00:01:38.810" style="s2">better move than trying to make it go</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.409" end="00:01:41.750" style="s2">away all the time yeah I like that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.810" end="00:01:44.210" style="s2">also kind of like um but I got from that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.750" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">is like the the judgment that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.210" end="00:01:47.870" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s like also making</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.180" style="s2">friends with that judgment totally</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.870" end="00:01:53.479" style="s2">totally yeah there&#39;s like the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.180" end="00:01:55.159" style="s2">like the feeling bad and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.479" end="00:01:56.840" style="s2">fork in the road and it&#39;s you could you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.159" end="00:02:00.350" style="s2">can either have anxiety about feeling</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.840" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">bad and disassociate and I sort of find</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.350" end="00:02:04.490" style="s2">your escape route and sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">fine like watching TV all day like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.490" end="00:02:09.379" style="s2">whatever like people that&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">and then the other move is to be curious</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.379" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">about the experience and actually move</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">to find the physiological correlate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:19.459" style="s2">the anxiety because it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:22.069" style="s2">information for you yes hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.459" end="00:02:24.249" style="s2">like I I&#39;m starting to view emotional</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.069" end="00:02:26.389" style="s2">states as like friends giving you advice</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.249" end="00:02:28.189" style="s2">but sometimes friends don&#39;t always give</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.389" end="00:02:28.819" style="s2">you the best advice but they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.189" end="00:02:29.569" style="s2">from a good place</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.819" end="00:02:30.829" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.569" end="00:02:33.620" style="s2">best to listen to them and translate</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.829" end="00:02:35.659" style="s2">them and whatever yeah and then looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:37.310" style="s2">to mind that that term from acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.659" end="00:02:41.180" style="s2">commitment therapy I think it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.310" end="00:02:44.120" style="s2">that dirty pain versus clean pain we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.180" end="00:02:45.980" style="s2">like what&#39;s the difference so clean pain</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.120" end="00:02:47.389" style="s2">is like you know you you&#39;re injured</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.980" end="00:02:48.859" style="s2">you&#39;re hurt like a loved one died</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.389" end="00:02:52.040" style="s2">someone breaks up with you it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.859" end="00:02:53.689" style="s2">hurts right but dirty pain is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.040" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">having that judgment on the pain so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.689" end="00:02:56.419" style="s2">like it&#39;s like doubly painful because</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:02:57.889" style="s2">you have a thing then you judge yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.419" end="00:02:59.870" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a pain from the judgment</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.889" end="00:03:01.969" style="s2">and then the dirty pain kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.870" end="00:03:03.829" style="s2">makes it last and it like makes it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.969" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">pathological right</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.829" end="00:03:10.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like compound interest on your pain</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">yeah a guy has this as a kid so I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.310" end="00:03:17.030" style="s2">a check-ins now definitely my check-in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:19.069" style="s2">now would be different than if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.030" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">start if I would have just started this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.069" end="00:03:22.459" style="s2">session with the check-in yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:25.189" style="s2">kind of good now there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.459" end="00:03:28.699" style="s2">lightness at doing that little exchange</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.189" end="00:03:30.139" style="s2">with you I was feeling sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.699" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">fragmented a little bit a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:02.589" style="s2">thought they went extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.009" end="00:10:04.209" style="s2">especially the last one like I just I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.589" end="00:10:07.240" style="s2">said it in a few different places now</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.209" end="00:10:09.009" style="s2">that like you needed exercise and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.240" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">all calls playlists on Spotify by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.009" end="00:10:10.990" style="s2">way so if you want to like listen to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.540" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.990" end="00:10:14.949" style="s2">the last song you did when you no put</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.540" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">your hand in your heart and your hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.949" end="00:10:18.850" style="s2">your gut and then you just like stare to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:20.050" style="s2">everyone on the screen like I felt</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">really really tender and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.050" end="00:10:25.089" style="s2">connected there especially after all</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">that movement so I&#39;m curious two things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.089" end="00:10:30.220" style="s2">I&#39;m curious like like how do they go for</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:32.499" style="s2">you at the first two and like how did</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.220" end="00:10:36.789" style="s2">you go about designing them like</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.499" end="00:10:39.489" style="s2">hmm yeah the second one I felt like was</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.789" end="00:10:41.919" style="s2">a huge improvement on the first one</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.489" end="00:10:45.579" style="s2">which is to be expected the first one I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.919" end="00:10:46.869" style="s2">had no idea what it was gonna be but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.579" end="00:10:48.639" style="s2">second one actually just gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.869" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">bigger sense of what I wanted the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.639" end="00:10:55.809" style="s2">container to be starting out with</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:58.619" style="s2">stillness on either end and using that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.809" end="00:10:58.619" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.670" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">basically have stillness be the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.180" end="00:11:08.010" style="s2">barometer for the beginning and and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.910" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">you actually have space to check in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.010" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">see what changed right</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:14.970" style="s2">because I&#39;ll because dancing moves so</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.140" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">much energy and sometimes you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.970" end="00:11:18.510" style="s2">even a symptoms you&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">consciously aware what&#39;s happening which</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.510" end="00:11:22.829" style="s2">I think is okay that it sort of gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:26.070" style="s2">back to what I was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.829" end="00:11:27.959" style="s2">story piece like sometimes in in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.070" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.959" end="00:11:34.920" style="s2">it often starts with the story first the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.220" end="00:11:38.399" style="s2">meaning making first that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.920" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2">mind and a really skilled therapist can</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.399" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">help deconstruct that story as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:45.959" style="s2">process goes forward but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:48.649" style="s2">I think is really useful about moving</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.959" end="00:11:51.570" style="s2">first is you&#39;re actually checking into</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.649" end="00:11:54.930" style="s2">other pieces of information that your</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.570" end="00:11:57.140" style="s2">system has to offer so emotional</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.930" end="00:11:59.820" style="s2">emotions are often stuck in the body</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.140" end="00:12:04.709" style="s2">that&#39;s like there&#39;s all this research</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.820" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">and trauma where like if if an animal</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.709" end="00:12:09.240" style="s2">gets hit by a car like a deer for</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">example and isn&#39;t killed it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.240" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">immediately start shaking and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">to release the tension that was created</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.180" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">in that impact and and I think we we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">do that intuitively but oftentimes we</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:30.089" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">we have and if you&#39;re going with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.089" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">story first and you don&#39;t move that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.140" end="00:12:38.149" style="s2">energy you can start creating all these</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">belief systems around that stuckness</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.149" end="00:12:44.640" style="s2">rather than actually just being aware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">it moving it and then seeing what comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.640" end="00:12:48.860" style="s2">out on the other side the story will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:48.860" style="s2">completely different</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.420" end="00:12:55.220" style="s2">hmm seems like there&#39;s so much different</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.079" end="00:12:58.249" style="s2">with what you just said there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.220" end="00:13:01.819" style="s2">different ways to experiment especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.249" end="00:13:05.269" style="s2">like adding reintegrating the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.819" end="00:13:06.110" style="s2">component yeah so this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.269" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">want to talk to you about in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.110" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">conversation is I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:13.249" style="s2">listening to a lot of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:16.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve been having on the stoah and one</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.249" end="00:13:19.790" style="s2">of the one of the threads that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.850" end="00:13:22.869" style="s2">picked up with John Revathi and both</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.790" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">John and Zach Stein is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.869" end="00:13:28.129" style="s2">ritual and I think it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:33.619" style="s2">what John said about stealing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.129" end="00:13:36.980" style="s2">culture and I&#39;m I&#39;ve just been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.619" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">about this all week of what kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.980" end="00:13:41.269" style="s2">kind of ritual can we intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:43.309" style="s2">create in the context of this dance</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.269" end="00:13:45.559" style="s2">party and it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.309" end="00:13:47.869" style="s2">elaborate it doesn&#39;t have to be super</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.559" end="00:13:49.429" style="s2">mythopoetic but something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.869" end="00:13:52.699" style="s2">little bit more intentional than just</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.429" end="00:13:53.870" style="s2">starting with stillness and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.699" end="00:13:56.269" style="s2">awareness to different parts of the body</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.870" end="00:13:59.089" style="s2">like be like I&#39;m wanting to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.269" end="00:14:03.410" style="s2">more creative with that that ritual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.089" end="00:14:05.660" style="s2">it was coming to mind and this might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.410" end="00:14:08.569" style="s2">like feel free to swap this away or</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.660" end="00:14:11.870" style="s2">whatever but it might be a seed here</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.569" end="00:14:13.459" style="s2">some aspect of it is you know Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.870" end="00:14:17.899" style="s2">tiger the guy who kind of influenced my</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.459" end="00:14:19.879" style="s2">kind of philosophical trajectory he</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.899" end="00:14:23.540" style="s2">always talks about the question that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.879" end="00:14:25.819" style="s2">has has the most existential weight or</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.540" end="00:14:28.790" style="s2">is most extra-specially salient and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.819" end="00:14:30.439" style="s2">views philosophy is not sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.790" end="00:14:32.629" style="s2">dialoguing about all these abstract</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.439" end="00:14:34.549" style="s2">issues is it&#39;s what is most relevant in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.629" end="00:14:36.980" style="s2">your life that connects with the mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.549" end="00:14:39.379" style="s2">and the heart so in his philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.980" end="00:14:40.670" style="s2">practice is always about the person you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.379" end="00:14:43.610" style="s2">know like you know like starting like</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.670" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">reasoning from their issue that is as</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.610" end="00:14:47.809" style="s2">most alive for them so I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:50.569" style="s2">there&#39;s something that could be present</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.809" end="00:14:52.220" style="s2">there about like present seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.569" end="00:14:54.319" style="s2">question that is the most alive for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.220" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">or most existentially salient and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.319" end="00:15:00.309" style="s2">maybe an answer might come come through</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:03.010" style="s2">dancing or something like that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.309" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.010" end="00:15:12.140" style="s2">yeah I like that have the question lead</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:18.020" style="s2">the movement yeah have you seen the oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.140" end="00:15:21.950" style="s2">way do you know that show no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.020" end="00:15:23.150" style="s2">Netflix show and there&#39;s this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.950" end="00:15:25.150" style="s2">want to talk too much about I just</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.150" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">couldn&#39;t want to point to this one</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.150" end="00:15:35.980" style="s2">sequence there&#39;s this some really</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:40.670" style="s2">interesting way that they explore</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.980" end="00:15:45.110" style="s2">movement and synchronicity and it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.670" end="00:15:48.380" style="s2">of a sci-fi type show and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.110" end="00:15:50.540" style="s2">the main character this woman has access</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.380" end="00:15:54.650" style="s2">to these codes and the codes are</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.540" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">expressed through movement and the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.650" end="00:16:01.520" style="s2">way to access the let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:05.690" style="s2">intelligence of this particular code</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.520" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">sequence is for I think six people to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.690" end="00:16:12.830" style="s2">this this series of movements at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:14.870" style="s2">same time with the same intention not</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.830" end="00:16:17.500" style="s2">thinking but just like really dropping</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.870" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">into the flow of the experience right</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.500" end="00:16:26.300" style="s2">and and that&#39;s actually something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">many cultures have explored throughout</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.300" end="00:16:31.190" style="s2">history like the Sufis have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:35.330" style="s2">tradition the the whirling dervishes</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.190" end="00:16:36.950" style="s2">they&#39;re called and if you just google or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.330" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">look up on YouTube the whirling</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.950" end="00:16:42.709" style="s2">dervishes they induce this ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:44.450" style="s2">trance like experience by basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.709" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">spinning and focusing their attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.450" end="00:16:48.980" style="s2">upward and they&#39;re all spinning in</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:55.310" style="s2">unison and and they they move like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.980" end="00:16:57.650" style="s2">for very long periods of time and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.310" end="00:17:01.850" style="s2">receive information from this experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.650" end="00:17:04.150" style="s2">and it might depend on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.850" end="00:17:07.459" style="s2">what information is moving through them</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.150" end="00:17:11.000" style="s2">but by entering into this communal</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.459" end="00:17:13.040" style="s2">experience by connecting your movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.000" end="00:17:16.040" style="s2">to the group and by connecting your</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.040" end="00:17:20.080" style="s2">intention to communing with God</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.040" end="00:17:22.130" style="s2">in some way you who are going to receive</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.080" end="00:17:24.110" style="s2">something some new piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.130" end="00:17:27.050" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t have received before</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.110" end="00:17:29.930" style="s2">you entered into this experience right</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.050" end="00:17:34.670" style="s2">so it blends ritual it blends movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.930" end="00:17:37.300" style="s2">it blends communitas and it blends the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.670" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">sort of religious experience of ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.300" end="00:17:44.210" style="s2">so what&#39;s what&#39;s coming to mind right</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:46.430" style="s2">now hearing you say this and then going</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.210" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2">back to that suggestion about having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.430" end="00:17:52.100" style="s2">question it seems to individual based</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:53.180" style="s2">you know because everyone can have</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.100" end="00:17:56.270" style="s2">different questions with different</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.180" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">energies and then what was very sweet</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.270" end="00:17:59.030" style="s2">and tender about the last exercise with</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:00.560" style="s2">dance party especially when we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">staring at each other was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.560" end="00:18:03.560" style="s2">this the same emotions were coming up I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:06.380" style="s2">could I could feel it where all this in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.560" end="00:18:10.220" style="s2">the same music and so it had that sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.380" end="00:18:12.470" style="s2">of community toss feel to it and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.220" end="00:18:16.550" style="s2">came to mind is there&#39;s a session I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.470" end="00:18:18.110" style="s2">doing on Sunday with this FileMaker cafe</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.550" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">is a heady he&#39;s one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.110" end="00:18:21.890" style="s2">filmmakers she&#39;s things is really really</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:24.650" style="s2">radical radically honest and that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.890" end="00:18:27.680" style="s2">filmmaker and so we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:29.570" style="s2">called making friends with fear and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.680" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">like imagine a zoom call these these</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.570" end="00:18:32.330" style="s2">faces and then we&#39;re all gonna presents</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:33.650" style="s2">fear because that&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.330" end="00:18:37.220" style="s2">universal emotion that&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.650" end="00:18:38.330" style="s2">now and then we&#39;re gonna all feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.220" end="00:18:39.890" style="s2">then come what comes to mind when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.330" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">feel it and then we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.890" end="00:18:42.590" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna have like a one-minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.330" end="00:18:45.020" style="s2">share about what they&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:47.180" style="s2">right and then at the end we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.020" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">charlie make friends with fear like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.180" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">collectively do some kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:52.790" style="s2">loving-kindness meditation to fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">itself and I kind of like that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.790" end="00:18:56.390" style="s2">building relationships with her in</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:58.340" style="s2">states so I wonder how like like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.390" end="00:18:59.780" style="s2">fear dancing or anger dancing you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.340" end="00:19:02.300" style="s2">like yeah getting really into that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.780" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">motion collectively with people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.300" end="00:19:06.560" style="s2">totally I started to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">that a little bit in the last one with</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.560" end="00:19:12.920" style="s2">that that say anything song yeah alive</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:13.790" style="s2">and the glory of love I think is what</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.920" end="00:19:16.010" style="s2">the song is called</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.790" end="00:19:19.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like kind of this punk rock defiant</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.010" end="00:19:23.810" style="s2">song and that felt a really potent and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.750" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also this question of not</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.810" end="00:19:27.720" style="s2">necessarily wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:30.610" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.720" end="00:19:32.380" style="s2">project a certain emotional state on</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.610" end="00:19:35.530" style="s2">somebody if that&#39;s not what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.380" end="00:19:38.020" style="s2">going through so I&#39;m kind of holding</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.530" end="00:19:41.410" style="s2">that that tension of really wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.020" end="00:19:43.420" style="s2">explore the fruit of diving deep into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.410" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">particular emotional state and how that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.420" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">dance wants to express itself hmm well</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:52.750" style="s2">at the same time just sort of letting</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">whatever comes up naturally happen for</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.750" end="00:20:02.500" style="s2">the individual a mover or dancer there</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">might be something to structuring one</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.500" end="00:20:06.429" style="s2">existential dance party and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">structuring it and a little bit more of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.429" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">an intentional way and saying that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.800" end="00:20:17.560" style="s2">we will be priming everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:19.510" style="s2">to move through these different</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.560" end="00:20:21.220" style="s2">emotional states and if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.510" end="00:20:22.840" style="s2">you you&#39;re interested in surrendering to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.220" end="00:20:24.670" style="s2">that experience like it&#39;s here for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.840" end="00:20:26.530" style="s2">and if that feels a little too edgy or</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.670" end="00:20:29.140" style="s2">uncomfortable like maybe sit this one</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.530" end="00:20:31.770" style="s2">out just like being a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.140" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">upfront about what the thing is right</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.770" end="00:20:34.870" style="s2">yeah and what I&#39;m appreciating about you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:36.790" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.870" end="00:20:41.050" style="s2">and and it&#39;s this it&#39;s building trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.790" end="00:20:42.940" style="s2">like more trust toward that I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.050" end="00:20:44.140" style="s2">towards you is is I can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.940" end="00:20:46.740" style="s2">discernment that you&#39;re having right</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.140" end="00:20:49.270" style="s2">here you&#39;re being very considerate</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.740" end="00:20:50.560" style="s2">because if you you set a frame to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.270" end="00:20:52.390" style="s2">strongly just could bias the whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.560" end="00:20:53.950" style="s2">experience and could like defeat the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.390" end="00:20:57.040" style="s2">purpose of what the dang one is asking</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.950" end="00:20:58.330" style="s2">of you right now so I see a nimble</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.040" end="00:21:02.490" style="s2">Astaire and I would know which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.330" end="00:21:11.050" style="s2">appreciating in this building trust yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.490" end="00:21:13.270" style="s2">yeah yeah this um I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.050" end="00:21:16.810" style="s2">doing with the stoah is really inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.270" end="00:21:20.050" style="s2">it&#39;s the exploratory nature of it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.810" end="00:21:23.040" style="s2">the the whole gift economy overlay on</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.050" end="00:21:28.550" style="s2">top of it I think is really really cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.040" end="00:21:31.580" style="s2">and I I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.550" end="00:21:33.470" style="s2">what what would be possible to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:35.630" style="s2">something similar but having it be all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.470" end="00:21:38.540" style="s2">about movement and just inviting</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.630" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">different movement teachers and leaders</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.540" end="00:21:43.700" style="s2">on four different sessions like doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:46.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t John Burbank II do Tai Chi yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.700" end="00:21:48.980" style="s2">like if I John wanted to lead a Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.610" end="00:21:52.280" style="s2">workshop have somebody do a yoga</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.980" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">workshop have like I&#39;m friends with one</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.280" end="00:21:58.790" style="s2">of Edo portals main students and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">someone lead like a IDO portal style mmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.790" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">and culture exercise and it could be and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:07.250" style="s2">have it be like a very similar sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:09.740" style="s2">framing like the stoah has but have it</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.250" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">be more explicitly be about movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.740" end="00:22:13.580" style="s2">yeah I think that I think that could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:16.430" style="s2">so cool so that&#39;s funny that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.580" end="00:22:22.550" style="s2">mentioned that because the the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.430" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">came to mind when I felt into your Damon</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.550" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">and the actual special dance party is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">like a digital dance studio that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:31.820" style="s2">sort of a spiritual feel or</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:32.900" style="s2">philosophical feel to it and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.820" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">basically is just exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.900" end="00:22:39.830" style="s2">described like this ion movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:40.940" style="s2">whatever design movement collective yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.830" end="00:22:43.400" style="s2">like that could be a digital dance</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.940" end="00:22:46.070" style="s2">studio right that like you you Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.400" end="00:22:47.780" style="s2">like I&#39;m Stuart in the stoah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.070" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">like it features all these different</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.780" end="00:22:52.160" style="s2">facilitators I can operate on something</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:54.500" style="s2">like the gift economy - yeah yeah how is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.160" end="00:22:58.810" style="s2">the gift economy model working so far</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.500" end="00:22:58.810" style="s2">like what do you have different</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.110" end="00:23:03.050" style="s2">relationships with it at different times</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:05.960" style="s2">or does it are you just trusting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.050" end="00:23:08.360" style="s2">whole thing right now well it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.960" end="00:23:09.710" style="s2">like like I mentioned like my and Winton</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.360" end="00:23:11.570" style="s2">Brett invite Andrew on because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.710" end="00:23:13.790" style="s2">where I got the inspiration from and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:15.110" style="s2">he&#39;s been operating on the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.790" end="00:23:18.140" style="s2">over five years support his livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.110" end="00:23:19.820" style="s2">all that type of stuff with all of his</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.140" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">like all of his offerings that he</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.820" end="00:23:25.040" style="s2">everything all gift economy yeah for his</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:27.620" style="s2">for his philosophical counseling I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.040" end="00:23:30.170" style="s2">he tried to do kind of like a consulting</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.620" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">business but it didn&#39;t really fly but</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.170" end="00:23:34.730" style="s2">yeah and once he hit like some some</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:36.440" style="s2">articles got released on him visit</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.730" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">started some of his conversational</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.440" end="00:23:40.370" style="s2">partners were in Silicon Valley so they</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">had a lot of influence and money and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.370" end="00:23:42.380" style="s2">he started getting the gift started</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.640" style="s2">getting more so</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.380" end="00:23:48.310" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get into his details but</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.640" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">you know worked out well for him and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.310" end="00:23:53.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve hosted like hundreds of events here</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">in Toronto for free I charged for one</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.960" end="00:23:59.780" style="s2">conference and you know I just enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:24:01.580" style="s2">it I was like Damon inspired and now I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.780" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">brought the stuff online because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.580" end="00:24:05.410" style="s2">Cova we can&#39;t meet in person and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel right to charge money right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.410" end="00:24:10.040" style="s2">even though I think a lot of people need</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.370" end="00:24:12.560" style="s2">money or finances but it feels really</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.040" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">right to present this as a gift because</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.560" end="00:24:15.380" style="s2">it does feel like this is my greatest</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.290" style="s2">gift to the world right now</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:26.570" style="s2">of it so I feel pretty pretty good with</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.740" end="00:24:27.860" style="s2">that area for now so now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.570" end="00:24:29.540" style="s2">turning to the question what could be my</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.860" end="00:24:32.540" style="s2">highest gift to the world and it really</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.540" end="00:24:34.940" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s a stola but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.540" end="00:24:37.940" style="s2">like and I but it feels really right</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.390" end="00:26:36.340" style="s2">your name like Zion I don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:37.990" style="s2">was intentional on your part but what</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.340" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">comes to mind when I think of Zion isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.990" end="00:26:42.310" style="s2">seen in the matrix to where everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:44.590" style="s2">was dancing like you know wildly</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.310" end="00:26:46.360" style="s2">hedonistic dancing and they&#39;re like and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.590" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">I think tour in Zion there was there any</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.360" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">connection there is that just uh yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:51.640" style="s2">there there are a lot of connections</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:54.910" style="s2">with the Zion</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.640" end="00:26:56.860" style="s2">so one of them I mean one of them is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.910" end="00:26:58.780" style="s2">matrix because I&#39;m just a huge fan of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.860" end="00:27:02.170" style="s2">that movie I was a very impactful movie</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.780" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">when I watched it for the first time but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.170" end="00:27:08.290" style="s2">then I also I grew up Mormon until I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:11.580" style="s2">nine and Mormons have a huge connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.290" end="00:27:15.720" style="s2">to Zion like the Zion is there like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.580" end="00:27:18.400" style="s2">freedom utopia Promised Land place right</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.720" end="00:27:21.190" style="s2">and then the Rastas have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.400" end="00:27:23.320" style="s2">relationship with Zion too and the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.190" end="00:27:27.150" style="s2">have a relationship design it basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.320" end="00:27:30.790" style="s2">is like utopia freedom liberation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.150" end="00:27:35.350" style="s2">when I started the podcast at two point</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.790" end="00:27:37.780" style="s2">no to me meant like what if Zion is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.350" end="00:27:40.840" style="s2">unfolding process and so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.780" end="00:27:43.240" style="s2">2.0 there can be a 3.0 4.0 and that</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.870" end="00:31:09.059" style="s2">through different different seasons of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.790" end="00:31:12.210" style="s2">life where we&#39;re drawn to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.059" end="00:31:14.520" style="s2">meme our personality is being expressed</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.210" end="00:31:16.440" style="s2">in a certain way based on the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.520" end="00:31:21.059" style="s2">ideas or people that were surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.440" end="00:31:25.500" style="s2">ourselves with and I can look back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.059" end="00:31:29.490" style="s2">see that my life goes through very</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.500" end="00:31:31.260" style="s2">distinct chapters where I think the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.490" end="00:31:34.590" style="s2">that Keegan puts it in his levels is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.260" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s more of a passive section where</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.590" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re just sort of listening and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:41.370" style="s2">receiving and then more of an active</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:43.950" style="s2">chapter of each level and the activists</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.370" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">were you&#39;re more engaged in a world and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.950" end="00:31:47.910" style="s2">sort of making concrete decisions based</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.840" style="s2">on maybe the information that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.910" end="00:31:54.299" style="s2">learned from the passive receiving part</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.840" end="00:31:57.390" style="s2">but for me rather than passive active it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.299" end="00:31:59.790" style="s2">feels more like serious and humorous</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.390" end="00:32:04.290" style="s2">sometimes I go through periods where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.790" end="00:32:07.980" style="s2">take myself so seriously and like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.290" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">ideas are just like so important so</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.980" end="00:32:14.850" style="s2">important you know and there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:18.059" style="s2">freedom and lusus and lightness when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.850" end="00:32:21.419" style="s2">able to relax and let that seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.059" end="00:32:24.570" style="s2">go I love the way that I think Zac said</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.559" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">like this transcendental humor right you</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.179" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">bury in like pre trans fallacy like</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:52.360" style="s2">maybe humor that is um a little too</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.360" end="00:32:56.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like sort of compensating for</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.250" end="00:32:58.270" style="s2">something else and then there&#39;s humor on</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.440" end="00:33:02.020" style="s2">the other side where you&#39;ve like really</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.970" end="00:35:23.060" style="s2">have changed because I&#39;ll be different</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:25.130" style="s2">in a few months and the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.060" end="00:35:27.109" style="s2">will be will feel a lot different than</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.260" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s this this Israeli guy who</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">studied many different movement</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:45.270" style="s2">techniques capoeira being one of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:53.050" style="s2">this sort of Brazilian dance martial art</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.270" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">mixture and his movement is he basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.050" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">one just wanted to study the first</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:59.110" style="s2">principles of movement like why you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:37:02.260" style="s2">would move in the first place and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.110" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">the what&#39;s the point of it and his whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.260" end="00:37:07.090" style="s2">thing is about is about context so</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:11.560" style="s2">training your system to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.090" end="00:37:13.930" style="s2">effectively in any given context so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.560" end="00:37:16.750" style="s2">is different than say bodybuilding where</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.930" end="00:37:18.940" style="s2">it&#39;s aesthetic focused where it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.750" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">about the pump it&#39;s all about the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.940" end="00:37:24.100" style="s2">building of muscle and you see these</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.210" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">like massive bodybuilders who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.100" end="00:37:29.770" style="s2">all of that that principle to its</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:33.310" style="s2">logical conclusion they&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.770" end="00:37:34.690" style="s2">that effective of movers like if you if</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.310" end="00:37:36.970" style="s2">you asked one of these giant</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.690" end="00:37:41.380" style="s2">bodybuilders to help you like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.970" end="00:37:44.050" style="s2">know like I&#39;ll help you move your couch</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.380" end="00:37:46.510" style="s2">or something they may not actually be as</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.050" end="00:37:49.540" style="s2">good at it because they&#39;ve been focusing</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.510" end="00:37:51.970" style="s2">on the muscles that are loose there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.540" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">that aesthetics so you know poor tall</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.970" end="00:37:57.250" style="s2">stuff is like how can you be the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">effective sort of maximize your</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.500" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">given context it&#39;s all about play</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.020" end="00:38:05.890" style="s2">beginner&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:07.360" style="s2">it feels very sort of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.890" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">Eastern philosophy that feels that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.360" end="00:38:11.869" style="s2">gets sort of integrated into his his</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:16.039" style="s2">philosophy hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.869" end="00:38:19.880" style="s2">I have a desire to ask you for advice so</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.039" end="00:38:24.140" style="s2">the going back to when I first saw you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.880" end="00:38:25.970" style="s2">dancing on Twitter right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.140" end="00:38:30.410" style="s2">tension there for me experiencing that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.970" end="00:38:31.490" style="s2">because like I said it just didn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.410" end="00:38:32.930" style="s2">my mental model of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.490" end="00:38:34.039" style="s2">you know like Collins the podcaster guy</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.930" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">that&#39;s in the sense making babies not</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.039" end="00:38:37.700" style="s2">dancing why is he doing this right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:40.009" style="s2">that was kind of like a confusing thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.700" end="00:38:42.319" style="s2">and then there was a judgement</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.009" end="00:38:43.549" style="s2">associated on my end seeing that all</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.319" end="00:38:45.740" style="s2">right it was it was a subtle adjustment</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.549" end="00:38:47.089" style="s2">judgement there and feeling into that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.740" end="00:38:49.640" style="s2">judgment now I don&#39;t have it now but</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.089" end="00:38:52.670" style="s2">feeling into what that judgement was it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.640" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">was almost maybe a jealousy or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.670" end="00:38:56.210" style="s2">maybe too strong of a word but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:38:58.099" style="s2">I can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.210" end="00:39:00.950" style="s2">or there&#39;s a belief that I can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.099" end="00:39:03.499" style="s2">and I&#39;ve ever wrote about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.950" end="00:39:04.910" style="s2">the daily meditation Journal I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.499" end="00:39:06.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like the closest thing I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.910" end="00:39:08.269" style="s2">come to dancing was I going to like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.470" end="00:39:10.279" style="s2">these awkward indie rock concerts and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.269" end="00:39:12.549" style="s2">just bobbing my head you know like being</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.279" end="00:39:16.519" style="s2">self-conscious and I remember the first</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.549" end="00:39:17.809" style="s2">existential dance party I was with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.519" end="00:39:19.609" style="s2">wife and we were like self-consciously</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.809" end="00:39:21.109" style="s2">dancing and I just felt like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.609" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">self-consciousness do every single</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.109" end="00:39:26.089" style="s2">movement and then the second one I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:28.609" style="s2">by myself and I just let it go you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.089" end="00:39:30.019" style="s2">like like I let my body go and I still</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.609" end="00:39:31.640" style="s2">felt the self-consciousness but I like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.019" end="00:39:35.420" style="s2">there was moments where just went away</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.640" end="00:39:37.099" style="s2">and then in my head I&#39;m like well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.420" end="00:39:40.029" style="s2">doing pretty good I&#39;m not like I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.099" end="00:39:43.460" style="s2">dancing pretty well and then I watched</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.029" end="00:39:45.410" style="s2">the video of of the recording I just</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.460" end="00:39:48.799" style="s2">kept doing this like weird fish move I</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.410" end="00:39:50.150" style="s2">call God the guide so I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.799" end="00:39:51.799" style="s2">question is it could be multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.150" end="00:39:54.319" style="s2">questions here is like how to get over</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.799" end="00:39:55.910" style="s2">that self-consciousness that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.319" end="00:39:57.380" style="s2">right question the question I want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.910" end="00:40:00.339" style="s2">ask and it&#39;s probably the wrong question</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.380" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">is is this how do I be a better dancer</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.339" end="00:40:11.090" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:12.380" style="s2">hmm well I think I think you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.090" end="00:40:15.230" style="s2">right track because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.380" end="00:40:22.070" style="s2">curiosity is the is the place to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.230" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">and and like what I heard you say when</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.070" end="00:40:26.990" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about this was there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:29.090" style="s2">there were moments where you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.990" end="00:40:30.380" style="s2">of surrendering to your own the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.090" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">experience of your body letting your</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.380" end="00:40:34.010" style="s2">body Drive and then the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:35.690" style="s2">self-consciousness would come back it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.010" end="00:40:37.160" style="s2">sort of like um like a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.690" end="00:40:39.350" style="s2">practice you know moving your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.160" end="00:40:43.490" style="s2">your thoughts start to arise</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.350" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">the move isn&#39;t to be like oh fuck now</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.490" end="00:40:47.060" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking dammit dammit dammit its to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:50.840" style="s2">notice the thoughts they&#39;re there and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.060" end="00:40:54.260" style="s2">then let them go so yeah maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.840" end="00:40:58.940" style="s2">it&#39;s to to treat the experience like an</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.260" end="00:41:02.600" style="s2">embodied meditation and the experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.940" end="00:41:05.660" style="s2">of just open awareness to me it feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.600" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">very similar to the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.660" end="00:41:10.810" style="s2">letting my body move in the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:10.810" style="s2">wants to move</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.950" end="00:41:17.410" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been experimenting with this</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:21.640" style="s2">this piece that&#39;s like um difference and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.410" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">repetition so repetition is finding a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.640" end="00:41:26.830" style="s2">pattern so finding some sort of movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:30.190" style="s2">sequence that feels good and that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.830" end="00:41:33.250" style="s2">and that you can say okay I have this</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.190" end="00:41:35.140" style="s2">down maybe it&#39;s some footwork maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.250" end="00:41:36.610" style="s2">doing something with your with your arms</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.140" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s swaying back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.610" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a pattern and you repeat it so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:43.810" style="s2">repetition this is kind of like a mantra</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:46.120" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of anchoring you into this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.810" end="00:41:49.060" style="s2">experience that&#39;s like okay I can do</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.120" end="00:41:51.670" style="s2">this this is what I can do and then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.060" end="00:41:54.730" style="s2">difference piece is when you feel moved</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.670" end="00:41:56.950" style="s2">to disrupt the pattern and have</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.730" end="00:41:59.560" style="s2">something new emerge something new and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.950" end="00:42:02.590" style="s2">creative mmm so it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.560" end="00:42:08.020" style="s2">oscillation between emergent creativity</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.590" end="00:42:10.550" style="s2">and step-by-step mastery which starts</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.020" end="00:42:13.490" style="s2">with small patterns</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.550" end="00:42:15.080" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool and this is I mean as</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.490" end="00:42:18.380" style="s2">far as like teaching people how to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.080" end="00:42:20.780" style="s2">better dancers this is like where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.380" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">this is the edge of my this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.780" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">edge of my thinking because I really do</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:27.710" style="s2">want how to figure out how to teach</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:29.360" style="s2">dance in a way that isn&#39;t just teaching</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.710" end="00:42:31.580" style="s2">choreography because I&#39;m not really that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.360" end="00:42:32.360" style="s2">interested in that and I think this is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.580" end="00:42:34.940" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.360" end="00:42:37.310" style="s2">actually but I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.940" end="00:42:38.510" style="s2">good intersection like this idea sex</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.310" end="00:42:41.840" style="s2">between you know like kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.510" end="00:42:43.900" style="s2">embodiment trauma release you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.840" end="00:42:48.020" style="s2">choreography all combined together</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:49.310" style="s2">creativity and then in your your digital</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.020" end="00:42:52.040" style="s2">dance studio that you&#39;ll be opening up</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.310" end="00:42:55.970" style="s2">soon if like if you had a course like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.040" end="00:42:58.520" style="s2">would definitely take it um yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.970" end="00:43:01.700" style="s2">would um what would you want from from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.520" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">dance course like other than just I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.700" end="00:43:11.960" style="s2">to be a better dancer like if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:16.730" style="s2">be more specific well I guess by the end</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.960" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">of the course I could go to an</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.730" end="00:43:25.270" style="s2">existential dance party and feel fully</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:27.230" style="s2">there and also look good while doing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.270" end="00:43:29.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like it I guess that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.230" end="00:43:32.090" style="s2">learning objective of the course I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.420" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">to take and I think that&#39;s I actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.090" end="00:43:35.960" style="s2">think that&#39;s important I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:37.340" style="s2">important to feel to look good while</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.960" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a thing yeah it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.340" end="00:43:42.950" style="s2">only thing but like vanity is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:44.210" style="s2">perfectly good motivation for doing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.950" end="00:43:46.910" style="s2">thing yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.210" end="00:43:49.130" style="s2">not the only reason but like why not I</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.910" end="00:43:50.810" style="s2">draw wants to look and feel good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.130" end="00:43:52.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like having a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.810" end="00:43:54.050" style="s2">that like not denying what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.970" end="00:43:56.150" style="s2">right and I think when you deny what</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.050" end="00:43:57.320" style="s2">what you just said then you start having</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.150" end="00:43:58.520" style="s2">an unhealthy relationship and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.320" end="00:44:00.800" style="s2">doing it anyways but you pretend you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.520" end="00:44:04.500" style="s2">not doing it I&#39;m I shut up right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:06.359" style="s2">yeah yeah no I totally agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.500" end="00:44:09.750" style="s2">so in addition to that learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.359" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">objective yeah just the practicals of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.750" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">I like the idea like giving the person</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:15.780" style="s2">like some kind of like dance step or</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.849" style="s2">something right like giving him a series</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.780" end="00:44:19.170" style="s2">of that and then maybe having exercises</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.849" end="00:44:22.230" style="s2">and how to break it so they just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.170" end="00:44:25.140" style="s2">training wheels in a way that would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.230" end="00:44:27.570" style="s2">really helpful and it could be like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.140" end="00:44:29.510" style="s2">like just I remember my friend a Lube</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.570" end="00:44:31.800" style="s2">Ameer ours off the guy who did in shadow</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.369" style="s2">I dance and then I asked how you should</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:47.190" style="s2">learn how to dance and then he basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.369" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">like just copied asurs moves right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.190" end="00:44:50.010" style="s2">he did I should move he&#39;s copying it in</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">the his house like watching videos and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.010" end="00:44:52.590" style="s2">he went to practice a nightclub and he</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:54.180" style="s2">kept doing that back and forth and he</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.590" end="00:44:56.300" style="s2">became like an amazing dancer from it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.180" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.300" end="00:45:01.080" style="s2">but if you can somehow like take that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:02.970" style="s2">method and like make it accessible make</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.080" end="00:45:05.400" style="s2">it fun you know make it like a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.970" end="00:45:06.540" style="s2">good gesturing towards communitas I</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.400" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">think that&#39;d be a really really cool</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.540" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">thing yeah yeah I think a good I think a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:16.010" style="s2">good first step might be to invite a few</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:20.220" style="s2">choreographers that are really good at</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.010" end="00:45:22.050" style="s2">transmitting moves have them on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.220" end="00:45:24.359" style="s2">digital dance studio so I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.050" end="00:45:26.220" style="s2">learn some pedagogical techniques from</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.359" end="00:45:30.500" style="s2">them along with everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.220" end="00:45:33.240" style="s2">yes it&#39;s I think us being podcasters</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.500" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">really it really lends itself for being</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.240" end="00:45:37.980" style="s2">a steward of these kind of digital</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">spaces because like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.980" end="00:45:42.060" style="s2">humbling experience talking to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:43.830" style="s2">Hall for example right because like okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.060" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">the guy is the crazy iq is intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.830" end="00:45:46.980" style="s2">like but I don&#39;t need to be at his level</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.980" style="s2">that way I can just have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.980" end="00:45:51.270" style="s2">facilitate by asking the questions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.980" end="00:45:52.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing with being a Stewart</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.270" end="00:45:55.349" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be the person that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.700" end="00:45:57.510" style="s2">engineers everything but you just have</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.349" end="00:45:59.220" style="s2">to be good enough to speak to someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.510" end="00:46:00.300" style="s2">else&#39;s day long and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.220" end="00:46:01.589" style="s2">relationship with your own day when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.300" end="00:46:02.790" style="s2">ever relationship with their day one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.589" end="00:46:04.670" style="s2">then you just tease it out kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.790" end="00:46:07.530" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.670" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">so yeah I think I think the pollak part</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.530" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">especially the meta podcasting is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:13.740" style="s2">skillset if it&#39;s finally useful for</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:19.310" style="s2">something right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.740" end="00:46:21.600" style="s2">um I think it lends itself to that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.310" end="00:46:27.210" style="s2">so I don&#39;t ask you something about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.600" end="00:46:30.230" style="s2">existential dance party sure what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.210" end="00:46:36.090" style="s2">what is something an experience a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.230" end="00:46:39.300" style="s2">feeling a sensation that you would like</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.090" end="00:46:42.540" style="s2">to explore that we haven&#39;t already whoo</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.300" end="00:46:44.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question hoof</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.070" end="00:47:06.750" style="s2">coming up for some reason right now in</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.069" end="00:48:44.520" style="s2">look it up and they start reading about</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.990" end="00:48:46.619" style="s2">it and it elicits something in them</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.520" end="00:48:48.599" style="s2">there so it&#39;s priming their experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.619" end="00:48:49.859" style="s2">before they walk in there might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.599" end="00:48:54.210" style="s2">something that&#39;s powerful about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.859" end="00:48:56.309" style="s2">yeah and when I was thinking too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.210" end="00:48:58.950" style="s2">like so this is still was getting like</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.309" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">more people come like we the guy saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.950" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">sock event I was like a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">RSVP&#39;d Yancy strickler&#39;s having the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:06.990" style="s2">crowd of over 100 on Thursday and so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:08.309" style="s2">imagine more attention is gonna go to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.990" end="00:49:09.660" style="s2">the existential dance party another kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.309" end="00:49:11.339" style="s2">of these psycho technologies there I</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.660" end="00:49:15.150" style="s2">imagine you&#39;re gonna have multiple ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.339" end="00:49:16.619" style="s2">and your your studio as well and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.150" end="00:49:18.750" style="s2">would be good to have a theme I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.619" end="00:49:20.010" style="s2">because it&#39;s like selection bias it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.750" end="00:49:21.720" style="s2">like yeah I don&#39;t really need to do most</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.010" end="00:49:23.160" style="s2">right now I&#39;m good there so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.720" end="00:49:25.500" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna opt out of it but then the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.160" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">people who can do it or want to do it or</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.500" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s something calling them</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">you know they get selected for they get</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:32.460" style="s2">called towards it so I I do think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:35.819" style="s2">selection bias thing is pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.460" end="00:49:38.849" style="s2">there with having a theme on it yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.819" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">okay cool I like that she&#39;s so she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.920" end="00:51:04.520" style="s2">through like just reason I&#39;m reasoning I</p>
