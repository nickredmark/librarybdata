<p begin="00:00:01.469" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">let me just type this in the chat all</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:38.989" style="s2">right so how do I pronounce your name</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">matheus may see us now - she&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.989" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">matheus okay have you been to any have</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">you been to one of these before do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">know how these work yes okay I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">just basically a structured conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">but yeah so we&#39;re just going live in one</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">oh we are live we are live already sorry</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">had anything okay so yeah so this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">solution raising is on game B which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">deliberately slightly vague right so it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">leaves the space very open for a what</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">your interpretation of game B might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">and secondly how we might move towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">it so there&#39;s three sections of it the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">first one is what are we doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">the second section is what would your</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">perfect version of it look like and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">the third and final part which is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">longest bit is sort of the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">possible how might we move from where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">are towards what might be better you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">know what I mean how can we take a step</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">on the road towards it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">and so yeah I mean anyone can go</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">whenever they want to really we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">need to go around in order doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">to be that rigid so if anyone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">anything they want to kick off with then</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">go ahead I&#39;ve got some stuff so I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">just immerse myself in everything in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">kind of the game B universe mostly</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">through Jordan Hall and Daniel smacking</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">burger and you know some others as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of starting I got really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">inspired still and feeling inspired</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:16.940" style="s2">started writing kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:22.230" style="s2">science fiction maybe fantasy book of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.940" end="00:02:26.510" style="s2">that would be the game B universe in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.230" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">future and then the history basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.510" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">you know the war or the civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">collapse at least partial or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not really outlined yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of on chapter 1 but it would it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">would go back in time also and then show</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">you you know kind of what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">then you know the stages of chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:52.740" style="s2">kind of ensued until game B finally came</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">into being I&#39;m a little bit stuck and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.740" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">actually messaged Jordan Paul I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">know if he&#39;ll respond he&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:03.210" style="s2">pretty busy but I messaged him through</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.130" style="s2">of all things LinkedIn because that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.210" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">like the first email spot and I only</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.130" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">have 300 characters to ask him a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:09.210" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">but basically where I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.210" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">stuck is that you know there are these</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">elements when you listen to you know in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">particular like the the the I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">like the YouTube video of Jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">and Daniel and Jordan all speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like a two-hour maybe three hour</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">conversation and they are attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">kind of have that third other that comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">up in a in a really good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.900" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">you know the the coach getting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:47.130" style="s2">coherence and then having that emergent</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.320" style="s2">property of something new coming up from</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.130" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">all those three elements coming together</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:55.080" style="s2">and then forming something new so I kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">of asked them that in kind of I asked</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.080" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">him basically you know in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">define what at least their current</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.060" end="00:04:04.830" style="s2">vision was is this you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">going to call it magic but like fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.830" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">is basically when you look at fantasy it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">involves magic something magical happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">when you look at science fiction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">some kind of technological thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">happens in general so I kind of see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:22.020" style="s2">game be needing a little bit of both and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.020" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">necessarily matte well going on about</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:26.790" style="s2">this emergent property of something new</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">arising</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.790" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">from three people communicating but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">also seeing that as potentially maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:36.930" style="s2">not quite being enough to create a game</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:38.340" style="s2">be if that makes sense yeah so if I met</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.930" end="00:04:39.300" style="s2">yourself if I&#39;m a you&#39;re saying can I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.340" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">jump in cuz I&#39;ve got it I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:41.720" style="s2">couple of things which may help clarify</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.720" end="00:04:46.890" style="s2">so first of all Jordan has embarked on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">something concrete now called the sybian</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.890" end="00:04:51.630" style="s2">project I don&#39;t know they&#39;re just last</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">week or something yeah which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.630" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">exactly that I think an attempt to fuse</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:59.430" style="s2">you know the the magic and the grounded</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">actual working in the real-world</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.430" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">elements and secondly what your points</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">into is also kind of a repetitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">problem in the problem made is not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">right word but conflict should we say in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">the game be space between those who</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">think that it&#39;s about primarily personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">development and making good people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:18.570" style="s2">those who think is primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">systems design you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.570" end="00:05:21.240" style="s2">there and there&#39;s always been a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">amount of friction between those two</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.240" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">things and so what you said about both</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">are required is absolutely necessary I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">think if I if I could just try to get us</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:34.110" style="s2">to broadly focus in the first section on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">what we are doing now rights of what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.110" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">is you know sort of character particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:41.160" style="s2">characteristics of game a that that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:42.600" style="s2">would like to see change as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.160" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">right you know I mean that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.600" end="00:05:48.270" style="s2">things I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all got all got</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.070" end="00:05:53.910" style="s2">our stuff mm-hmm the military point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.270" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">it problems you know or sale</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.910" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">environmental destruction those are</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">probably my three top ones yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.780" style="s2">gotta say what I like about the game be</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:08.550" style="s2">thing is is how war and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.780" end="00:06:10.530" style="s2">destruction and they all actually come</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:12.680" style="s2">under the saying it&#39;s all the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.530" end="00:06:15.390" style="s2">dynamic right it&#39;s all it&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.680" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">rivalry sness you know what I mean is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.390" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">it&#39;s that which is the central time</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:22.790" style="s2">which is what I has really appealed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:25.020" style="s2">me is that zoom out and you know but</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.790" end="00:06:27.000" style="s2">understanding that all of these problems</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">are actually the same thing playing out</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.000" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">in different domains right sorry I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.250" end="00:06:32.970" style="s2">already spoken too much and kerri-anne</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:35.400" style="s2">Macias having a chatter to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.970" end="00:06:40.439" style="s2">yet so I&#39;ll shut up now sorry I&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.400" end="00:06:42.529" style="s2">you go okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.439" end="00:06:46.229" style="s2">trying to find the shortest possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.529" end="00:06:51.419" style="s2">description of game a comes to mind as</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.229" end="00:06:55.709" style="s2">to things really well as scarcity and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.419" end="00:06:57.779" style="s2">are being regulars because there is some</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.709" end="00:07:01.069" style="s2">scarcity and there will always be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.779" end="00:07:08.279" style="s2">because of example one Mona Lisa right</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.069" end="00:07:12.569" style="s2">so things like resources resources food</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.279" end="00:07:17.099" style="s2">and the bottom of mussels pyramid they</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.569" end="00:07:20.189" style="s2">do not need to be scarce we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.099" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">we don&#39;t have now means to make all this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.189" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">physical scarcity go away basically and</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:20.249" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten into little arguments I have</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:23.849" style="s2">you know some conservative friends and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.249" end="00:08:27.509" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.849" end="00:08:29.969" style="s2">to understand the conservative viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.509" end="00:08:31.499" style="s2">you know and now to the point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.969" end="00:08:32.939" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t trigger me because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.499" end="00:08:34.409" style="s2">understand kind of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.939" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">fundamental beliefs which are really</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.409" end="00:08:39.059" style="s2">good and of which you know even like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">idea of sovereignty and and personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.059" end="00:08:43.979" style="s2">responsibility our conservative</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.979" end="00:08:48.389" style="s2">fundamentals and those are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.389" end="00:08:51.300" style="s2">really key elements of a successful game</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.389" end="00:08:54.510" style="s2">be so in a lot of ways they could speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.300" end="00:08:56.580" style="s2">well to the game be world</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.510" end="00:09:00.210" style="s2">that being said you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.580" end="00:09:02.250" style="s2">shorting stocks where you make them you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.210" end="00:09:05.310" style="s2">make your money when someone else fails</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.250" end="00:09:07.800" style="s2">is something that I&#39;ve for years have</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.310" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">said that&#39;s just not how things should</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.800" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">work like it&#39;s one thing in sports you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:16.140" style="s2">know somebody loses you know and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">rooting for them to lose but um you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.140" end="00:09:20.370" style="s2">when it really comes down to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:24.360" style="s2">lives and ability to get by that is just</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.370" end="00:09:25.950" style="s2">a crime so it was so that&#39;s what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.360" end="00:09:27.780" style="s2">blew my mind once I really started</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.950" end="00:09:29.460" style="s2">understanding what people were talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.780" end="00:09:31.020" style="s2">about in that some of these like</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.460" end="00:09:32.490" style="s2">Breville wisdom is kind of how I came</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.020" end="00:09:34.410" style="s2">across all these folks and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.490" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">took me months to even realize there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.410" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">something called game B I was just</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:38.520" style="s2">listening to them going wow these people</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">are really smart and these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.520" end="00:09:45.630" style="s2">interesting subjects and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">anyway you know and with the stocks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.630" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">not it&#39;s it again it would be one thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">if you&#39;ve lost faith in a company in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:53.610" style="s2">which you hold stock and you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">sell you&#39;re holding in them as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.610" end="00:09:57.480" style="s2">to taking a pump on them failing in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">future not even actually having any</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.480" end="00:10:01.950" style="s2">stock to sell right but promising to buy</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">stock in a in the future for less money</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.950" end="00:10:06.090" style="s2">that yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s and what it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">does is also it puts pressure on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.090" end="00:10:09.990" style="s2">company through no fault of their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.220" style="s2">you know now all of a sudden their share</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.990" end="00:10:13.500" style="s2">price is under pressure because people</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.220" end="00:10:14.940" style="s2">are shorting them through nothing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.500" end="00:10:17.370" style="s2">actually going on in the business you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.940" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">know so yeah no I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.370" end="00:10:25.410" style="s2">that all about you Carrie well basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:27.060" style="s2">I think every yeah well game a as I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">I agree with everything that you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:33.480" style="s2">and about profit and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:35.520" style="s2">human beings anymore not about enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.480" end="00:10:37.380" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s kind of been missing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.520" end="00:10:39.690" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s talking about everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.380" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">written realities on all its black</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.690" end="00:10:44.310" style="s2">shirts and it&#39;s about and those</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.170" style="s2">structures are causing of even more the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.310" end="00:10:48.030" style="s2">motivations as well go in and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.170" end="00:10:49.830" style="s2">everybody&#39;s living in a state of fear</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.030" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">now where they don&#39;t even trust anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.830" end="00:10:55.320" style="s2">so gameid there&#39;s no trust there anymore</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">there&#39;s no nothing and nobody&#39;s willing</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.320" end="00:11:00.300" style="s2">to unless there&#39;s pounds attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s fine then I think well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.300" end="00:11:05.550" style="s2">at the worth oh it&#39;s too much just now</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:07.180" style="s2">because I&#39;ve got an idea of how to and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.550" end="00:11:09.400" style="s2">things are being bubbling underneath</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.180" end="00:11:11.950" style="s2">the service but nobody&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.400" end="00:11:14.350" style="s2">reach out to anybody anymore or even</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.950" end="00:11:17.080" style="s2">have a conversation or a chat you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.350" end="00:11:20.770" style="s2">mean so that&#39;s the actual um so I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.080" end="00:11:23.260" style="s2">it was them there&#39;s no care in-game a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.770" end="00:11:25.060" style="s2">there&#39;s no cure at all there&#39;s no only</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.260" end="00:11:28.030" style="s2">notice there&#39;s no transparency there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.060" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">no let&#39;s see what we can try and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.030" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">no willingness</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:33.520" style="s2">well there is willingness and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:35.830" style="s2">people in different silos it was all</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.520" end="00:11:37.570" style="s2">like calling for all trust and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.830" end="00:11:43.390" style="s2">everything yeah but that&#39;s in spite all</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.570" end="00:11:48.330" style="s2">problem because with everything to do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.390" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">what do you know you know I mean massive</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.330" end="00:11:51.850" style="s2">thinking that you&#39;ve spent some time</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:53.470" style="s2">around the Venus Project and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.850" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">resource-based economics I&#39;m just from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.470" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">some of the language that you used it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:12:04.270" style="s2">sounded quite yeah I mean I started</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:06.340" style="s2">looking into alternatives to live a long</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.270" end="00:12:12.670" style="s2">time ago and came across like many</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.340" end="00:12:15.850" style="s2">products and the Venus yeah I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.670" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">friends in Polish chapter of of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.850" end="00:12:31.420" style="s2">organization we are thinking about and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">do some resource sharing and yeah try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.420" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">introduce new economy in in some small</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:45.310" style="s2">form so we see yes the resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">economy is what I would like to see in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.310" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">the future it just makes sense right</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:52.570" style="s2">there&#39;s finite and other resources they</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">need to be recycled we can build</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.570" end="00:12:58.780" style="s2">beautiful things upon materials recycled</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:13:00.610" style="s2">from the previous and obviously mmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.780" end="00:13:03.640" style="s2">unless we are thinking about mining</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.610" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">asteroids and bringing resources down</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.640" end="00:13:11.650" style="s2">from the space just you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:15.220" style="s2">other way really to get this production</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.650" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">consumption under control there just the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.220" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">notion of sharing rather than owning</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:20.110" style="s2">you&#39;re removing the notion of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.110" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">notion of the requirement to make profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:24.700" style="s2">from everything that you do just those</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.970" style="s2">two things alone</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.700" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">makes a massive difference to resource</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.970" end="00:13:37.269" style="s2">demand you know what I mean IIIi mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:39.430" style="s2">the massive yep so there is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.269" end="00:13:42.550" style="s2">that came to mind just moment ago I</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.430" end="00:13:45.310" style="s2">don&#39;t understand why there is this split</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.550" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">between advancement in technology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.310" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">self improvement as humans I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">was some it obviously needs to be both</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:59.769" style="s2">right yeah we have technology it just</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">needs to be perfect it and brought to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.769" end="00:14:13.089" style="s2">the white public I&#39;d say for free but</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:15.790" style="s2">it&#39;s you don&#39;t really and then it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.089" end="00:14:19.240" style="s2">kind of obvious I know I know to me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.790" end="00:14:24.029" style="s2">we as humans have some homework to do as</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.240" end="00:14:26.829" style="s2">well and this is also what I found in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.029" end="00:14:32.190" style="s2">fragments in The Venus Project there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.829" end="00:14:37.690" style="s2">something about that there and at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.190" end="00:14:42.690" style="s2">meaning crisis obviously and some kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.690" end="00:14:46.870" style="s2">of psychology cognitive science and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.690" end="00:14:52.839" style="s2">yeah religion and magic as well so it</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.870" end="00:14:57.449" style="s2">seems clear that humans as we are now</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.839" end="00:15:00.790" style="s2">without meditating without like</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.449" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">self-examination and you know getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.790" end="00:15:07.690" style="s2">deeper into what motivates us and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:09.970" style="s2">have growing spirituality and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.690" end="00:15:12.220" style="s2">saying any kind of whoo yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.970" end="00:15:13.959" style="s2">three girls people that whoo you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.220" end="00:15:15.399" style="s2">hit on you&#39;ve just hit on exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.959" end="00:15:16.930" style="s2">the problem was could be because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.399" end="00:15:18.550" style="s2">right so any intelligent person clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.930" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">it&#39;s both you can make design the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.550" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">systems in the world if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:23.170" style="s2">populated by corrupt people they&#39;re soon</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2">gonna collapse in on themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.170" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">and similarly you can have the loveliest</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.850" end="00:15:27.579" style="s2">people in the world without decent</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">systems to coordinate nothing ever gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.579" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">done so I mean you know it is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.970" style="s2">however the whoo thing is exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:36.819" style="s2">caused the schism because</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:39.069" style="s2">those who advocate the greater emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.819" end="00:15:42.040" style="s2">being on personal yeah not to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.069" end="00:15:43.240" style="s2">exclusion of systems but the main</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.040" end="00:15:45.160" style="s2">emphasis should be on personal</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.240" end="00:15:47.500" style="s2">development the accusation leveled</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.160" end="00:15:49.480" style="s2">against them is that that&#39;s all a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.500" end="00:15:50.889" style="s2">whew and you know what I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.480" end="00:15:52.600" style="s2">everyone&#39;s into the whole spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.889" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">thing and bla bla bla bla bla and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:15:58.360" style="s2">has to be a vocabulary that talks to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:16:00.040" style="s2">everyone and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.360" end="00:16:02.259" style="s2">one it&#39;s a difficult one I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.040" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">certainly no goddess but I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.259" end="00:16:09.490" style="s2">that a commitment to something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">yourself right the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.490" end="00:16:13.509" style="s2">understanding that there is a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.990" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">game than just your life going on here</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.509" end="00:16:17.620" style="s2">and that you&#39;re inspected however you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.670" end="00:16:19.149" style="s2">conceptualize that right but but there</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.620" end="00:16:19.569" style="s2">is something bigger than you going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.149" end="00:16:23.230" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.569" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">I do think an understanding or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.230" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">recognition of that is is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:36.939" style="s2">important yep yeah the thingis is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:39.309" style="s2">key and I guess that triggers people</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.939" end="00:16:44.529" style="s2">about it being Oh as in something</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.309" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">negative its if we ascribe to many weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.529" end="00:16:52.029" style="s2">adjectives to the bigger because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:54.939" style="s2">bigger is someone might say the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.029" end="00:16:58.750" style="s2">thing is like universe being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.939" end="00:17:04.299" style="s2">and gods and everything and all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.750" end="00:17:07.809" style="s2">unnecessary projections of how we think</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.299" end="00:17:10.329" style="s2">the bigger thing what it is we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.809" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">really no chance to describe it properly</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.329" end="00:17:19.000" style="s2">because we are limited in our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:21.610" style="s2">to define things that same for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.000" end="00:17:23.500" style="s2">this genuinely is not the same for</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.610" end="00:17:24.970" style="s2">everybody right so you know there has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.500" end="00:17:28.419" style="s2">be freedom for everyone to have their</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.970" end="00:17:31.059" style="s2">own thing the the but I think what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.419" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">common to all of us is that we need that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.059" end="00:17:37.510" style="s2">that bigger context in which to place</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:39.220" style="s2">ourselves right we all need that so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.510" end="00:17:40.570" style="s2">know it&#39;s like I don&#39;t feel familiar</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.220" end="00:17:42.760" style="s2">with non-violent communication but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.570" end="00:17:43.960" style="s2">think it applies across all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.760" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">domains right and it&#39;s about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.960" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">distinction between needs and strategies</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">is really</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:51.210" style="s2">really important that you understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:53.490" style="s2">that and so this this maps very well so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.210" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">that right the need the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.490" end="00:17:57.870" style="s2">need we all have is to be part of is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:17:59.010" style="s2">understand that we&#39;re part of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.870" end="00:18:01.680" style="s2">bigger than that right but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.010" end="00:18:03.480" style="s2">strategies that we use to satisfy that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.680" end="00:18:05.790" style="s2">need is different for all of us for some</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.480" end="00:18:07.230" style="s2">of its religion for some community for</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.790" end="00:18:08.730" style="s2">some of its its nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.230" end="00:18:10.890" style="s2">whatever it might be you know I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.730" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t matter what it is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.890" end="00:18:15.060" style="s2">point is to recognize that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">attempting to meet that same need being</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.060" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">sensitive to the fact that different</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">people meet that need in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">right and and and once once you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">once you understand that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:25.680" style="s2">actually all on the same thing we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:27.780" style="s2">trying to do the same thing we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.680" end="00:18:30.870" style="s2">going about it in different ways if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.780" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">can actually really deeply understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.870" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">that then conflict becomes not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">to get angry over and fight over it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:41.040" style="s2">becomes a space in which to generate new</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">ideas right the the clash of difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.040" end="00:18:44.820" style="s2">is now a generative thing right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:47.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not destructive its</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.820" end="00:18:49.860" style="s2">generative and so that that records for</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.970" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">me this is the deep deep deep thing of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.860" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">game be is that recognition that we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:55.740" style="s2">all on the same team we might have</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:18:58.590" style="s2">completely different ideas about things</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.740" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">but despite that we are still on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">same team and we never ever lose sight</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:08.130" style="s2">of that yeah we only we all shit we all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:11.610" style="s2">sleep do you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.130" end="00:19:13.680" style="s2">they&#39;re there there&#39;s and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.610" end="00:19:16.140" style="s2">everything is built on everything else</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.680" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">is built on that a few minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.140" end="00:19:24.990" style="s2">although the problem assaults yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:28.170" style="s2">so let&#39;s just add the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.990" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">coherence in a bit so you know obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.170" end="00:19:31.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of effort on governments</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:33.630" style="s2">you know United States government in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.350" end="00:19:36.270" style="s2">particular it feels like does a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.630" end="00:19:38.850" style="s2">you know you call it propaganda or you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.270" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">know with trying to get everybody on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.850" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">same page and there&#39;s not a lot of real</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:45.180" style="s2">trust in what is being spread through</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:46.770" style="s2">mainstream media and the leadership in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.180" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">general and there&#39;s clearly some type of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.770" end="00:19:52.350" style="s2">battle going on between you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:54.810" style="s2">blue church and the red religion or</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.350" end="00:19:57.450" style="s2">basically you know the the Heeia</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.810" end="00:19:59.460" style="s2">establishment and Donald Trump it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.450" end="00:20:00.639" style="s2">pretty scary time to be over here in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.460" end="00:20:04.120" style="s2">lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.639" end="00:20:07.889" style="s2">so a couple of things which are you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.120" end="00:20:11.500" style="s2">kind of these mean plexes self-enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.889" end="00:20:15.100" style="s2">idea structures that further polarize</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.500" end="00:20:33.929" style="s2">people that are problematic within the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.100" end="00:20:39.159" style="s2">universe so anyway you know like</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.929" end="00:20:41.500" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s thing of that if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.159" end="00:20:44.139" style="s2">don&#39;t believe you know that&#39;s the devil</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.500" end="00:20:47.759" style="s2">talking in your ear and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.139" end="00:20:51.490" style="s2">will burn in hell is such a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.759" end="00:20:53.230" style="s2">enforcer of a belief system which</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.490" end="00:20:56.230" style="s2">divides you from people who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.230" end="00:20:57.519" style="s2">unbelievers so it&#39;s really challenging</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.230" end="00:20:59.529" style="s2">to work with that and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.519" end="00:21:02.860" style="s2">similarities and some of the Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.529" end="00:21:04.330" style="s2">faith as well and so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.860" end="00:21:06.940" style="s2">really hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.330" end="00:21:08.889" style="s2">find that inner coherence when there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.940" end="00:21:12.940" style="s2">people that are literally protecting</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.889" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">themselves from joining you that be with</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:16.629" style="s2">every single person on the planet right</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.710" end="00:21:19.509" style="s2">this is this is a really important thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.629" end="00:21:21.220" style="s2">so yeah yeah you know you find your</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.509" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">people and that doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.220" end="00:21:25.090" style="s2">a bigger right it means that you find</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:27.100" style="s2">your people we are people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.090" end="00:21:29.139" style="s2">that we can talk to some of them agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.100" end="00:21:30.730" style="s2">with us saw them don&#39;t disagree with but</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.139" end="00:21:32.679" style="s2">we can talk to them right we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.730" end="00:21:33.940" style="s2">reasonable conversation with and if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.679" end="00:21:36.070" style="s2">you know if you can counsel people that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.940" end="00:21:37.870" style="s2">you simply calm or it&#39;s gonna take way</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.070" end="00:21:41.379" style="s2">too much effort before then you just</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.870" end="00:21:43.419" style="s2">don&#39;t you know what I mean do their</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.379" end="00:21:46.929" style="s2">thing you can&#39;t build bridges with all</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.419" end="00:21:48.970" style="s2">people it&#39;s just impossible so so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.929" end="00:21:51.279" style="s2">the idea that I&#39;m kind of getting around</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.970" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">to is just like the body has numerous</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.279" end="00:21:56.740" style="s2">independent systems that all function</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">together create an entire you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.860" end="00:22:25.399" style="s2">and I do think so you know he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.169" end="00:22:28.110" style="s2">that we&#39;re at approximately maybe 3% of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.399" end="00:22:29.909" style="s2">integral thinkers you know I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.110" end="00:22:32.690" style="s2">if you say a world or in this country</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.909" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">but like people who have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.690" end="00:22:38.429" style="s2">see all of these different partial</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:42.239" style="s2">truths and be able to integrate them all</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.429" end="00:22:43.799" style="s2">into you know a more coherent view of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.239" end="00:22:47.159" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.799" end="00:22:49.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a step above post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.159" end="00:22:52.109" style="s2">these more kind of like somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.259" end="00:22:59.700" style="s2">that number up to 10% which is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.700" end="00:23:06.359" style="s2">to start working together and coherence</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.100" end="00:23:09.149" style="s2">again so you know I think everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.359" end="00:23:12.929" style="s2">that we can do as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.149" end="00:23:15.119" style="s2">collectively to start thinking on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.929" end="00:23:17.129" style="s2">integral side of things and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.119" end="00:23:21.090" style="s2">spreading that viewpoint in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.129" end="00:23:23.809" style="s2">ways is you know it&#39;s gonna kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.090" end="00:23:26.279" style="s2">a get us to that 10% but we&#39;re in a race</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.809" end="00:23:28.529" style="s2">spreading viewpoints is something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.279" end="00:23:31.619" style="s2">troubles me it really does if you point</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.529" end="00:23:33.359" style="s2">so that it feels mission it feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.619" end="00:23:36.210" style="s2">missionary like you know what I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.359" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">feels different to the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.210" end="00:23:38.909" style="s2">missionaries going around telling all</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:41.399" style="s2">the natives that they had to go there</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.909" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">Jesus it feels no different</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.399" end="00:23:44.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why I mean that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:46.379" style="s2">we feel it&#39;s more enlightened philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.399" end="00:23:48.899" style="s2">does not mean that we have to go around</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.379" end="00:23:52.769" style="s2">spreading it if it&#39;s good it spreads on</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.899" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">its own just let&#39;s talk about Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.769" end="00:23:57.230" style="s2">Star Trek was kind of the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:59.820" style="s2">elements of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.230" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">post-modernism where like you know they</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.820" end="00:24:03.509" style="s2">have numerous races that they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:05.639" style="s2">know alien races and they are all</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.509" end="00:24:07.169" style="s2">working together and they functionally</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.639" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t you know they never really went</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.169" end="00:24:12.749" style="s2">to war so that was that viewpoint so by</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:15.149" style="s2">creating stories whether it&#39;s myths or</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.749" end="00:24:18.450" style="s2">whatever or sharing your ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.149" end="00:24:20.970" style="s2">kind of that tear true integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:23.669" style="s2">of pulling all of these partial truths</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.970" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">together is it&#39;s a good idea I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.669" end="00:24:26.919" style="s2">saying you create propaganda manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:28.239" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.919" end="00:24:32.259" style="s2">propaganda with no matter how you look</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.239" end="00:24:34.419" style="s2">at it there&#39;s an internal or not you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.259" end="00:24:35.710" style="s2">got to get people on the same page I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.419" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">mean that&#39;s just how that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.710" end="00:24:39.609" style="s2">coherence is so you know you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:41.289" style="s2">it as some dark force I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.609" end="00:24:43.210" style="s2">sometimes wondered of like maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.289" end="00:24:45.220" style="s2">maybe the blue church and stuff actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.210" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">has our best interest in the heart but</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.220" end="00:24:49.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just so fucking hard to see it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:25:00.789" style="s2">trust them on some level that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.720" end="00:25:04.859" style="s2">we demonize it but anyway I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.789" end="00:25:07.659" style="s2">tier 2 aspect of you know Ken Wilbur&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.859" end="00:25:09.789" style="s2">integral thought though is you know but</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.659" end="00:25:11.859" style="s2">been the wit the filter that I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.789" end="00:25:14.289" style="s2">looking at thing though yet but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.859" end="00:25:16.389" style="s2">looking at things through so the notion</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.289" end="00:25:17.769" style="s2">of drawing together strands of truths</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.389" end="00:25:19.509" style="s2">from lots of different places and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.769" end="00:25:21.850" style="s2">synthesizing them into into something</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.509" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">that you know works and and is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.850" end="00:25:26.950" style="s2">to you into the world and so on it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not I mean to an extent we all do</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:31.929" style="s2">that you know all the time in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.350" end="00:25:34.029" style="s2">right I mean it all he&#39;s done is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.929" end="00:25:36.399" style="s2">codify something that we all do anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.029" end="00:25:37.960" style="s2">and yeah I mean integral theory I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.399" end="00:25:40.419" style="s2">deeply familiar with it I have some</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.960" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">familiarity with it and it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.419" end="00:25:44.679" style="s2">good and it has decent explanatory power</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:46.539" style="s2">what I find with it well not so much</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.679" end="00:25:51.549" style="s2">with it but with many of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.539" end="00:25:53.649" style="s2">get really into it is that they to cut</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.549" end="00:25:55.119" style="s2">on the Mac so beautiful and so appealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.649" end="00:25:56.409" style="s2">that they kind of get lost in the map</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.119" end="00:25:58.029" style="s2">and they forget that the map is just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.409" end="00:26:00.070" style="s2">map right is not actually the territory</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.029" end="00:26:02.379" style="s2">and the whole point of a map is to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.070" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">inform your actual life and make it more</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.379" end="00:26:05.710" style="s2">manageable and better and more enriching</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.700" end="00:26:07.239" style="s2">and all of that kind of thing and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.710" end="00:26:09.700" style="s2">not to get lost in the map and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.239" end="00:26:11.139" style="s2">I mean it is as I say I&#39;m not deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.700" end="00:26:13.629" style="s2">familiar with it and it is it is a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.139" end="00:26:15.249" style="s2">map but I&#39;m my encounters with people</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.629" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">who have got deeply into it it made me</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.249" end="00:26:19.509" style="s2">somewhat resistant there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:20.980" style="s2">zealotry that seems to come along with</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.509" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">it right and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.980" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">me a little bit hesitant to get deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:26.739" style="s2">into it I don&#39;t know if you encountered</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:30.879" style="s2">the same thing well it&#39;s interesting yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.739" end="00:26:33.100" style="s2">yes and he literally stalks about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.879" end="00:26:37.450" style="s2">map and the territory ken does you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.100" end="00:26:39.789" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve you know I&#39;ve moved away</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.450" end="00:26:40.809" style="s2">from it on in a general sense because</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.789" end="00:26:43.139" style="s2">like you know no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.809" end="00:26:45.909" style="s2">want to pay $500 for your sharp you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.909" end="00:26:51.460" style="s2">classes about it but you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.990" end="00:26:54.610" style="s2">started really getting involved in game</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.460" end="00:26:56.470" style="s2">be it it came up in my consciousness on</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.610" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">its own after years of not really</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.470" end="00:27:00.460" style="s2">reading can even though I&#39;ve read you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">know majority of his books where I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.460" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">went oh you know this really fits into</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:07.870" style="s2">kind of what Ken&#39;s been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:09.929" style="s2">which is like you know patterns like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.870" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">there you know there really is different</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.929" end="00:27:15.909" style="s2">stratifications like you know white</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:18.519" style="s2">nationalism or nationalism is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.909" end="00:27:20.549" style="s2">as in Ken Ken&#39;s words like an orange</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.519" end="00:27:22.539" style="s2">level way of viewing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.549" end="00:27:24.970" style="s2">post-modernism which is a more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.539" end="00:27:27.759" style="s2">viewpoint is the green level looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:30.879" style="s2">the world and they both have correct</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.759" end="00:27:32.740" style="s2">aspects we do want to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.879" end="00:27:34.389" style="s2">tribes are good and important you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.740" end="00:27:36.730" style="s2">we&#39;re a tribe here right now we&#39;re game</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.389" end="00:27:39.340" style="s2">B tribe you know but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.730" end="00:27:44.940" style="s2">we&#39;re the most important thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.340" end="00:27:46.929" style="s2">what I mean so anyway but I hear you on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.940" end="00:27:48.460" style="s2">just coming up to the half-hour mark</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.929" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">which is where the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.460" end="00:27:52.509" style="s2">begins and so I mean we heard that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:53.799" style="s2">my fault entirely we&#39;ve kind of drifted</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.509" end="00:27:56.110" style="s2">off and just had a conversation which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.799" end="00:27:58.119" style="s2">fine but before we get into the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.110" end="00:28:02.139" style="s2">adjacent possible bit can we just go</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.119" end="00:28:05.470" style="s2">around quickly and everyone summarized</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.139" end="00:28:06.970" style="s2">walks you know the perfect game B world</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.470" end="00:28:08.769" style="s2">looks like yeah what is it what are we</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.970" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">actually trying to get to as best as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.769" end="00:28:13.119" style="s2">can articulate and I get it may be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:14.860" style="s2">somewhat fuzzy but as best you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.119" end="00:28:19.509" style="s2">you know what what does the game be</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.860" end="00:28:21.369" style="s2">world look like it&#39;s done we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.509" end="00:28:22.869" style="s2">transition is done complete we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.369" end="00:28:33.460" style="s2">where we&#39;re playing game B what does it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.869" end="00:28:37.570" style="s2">look like okay Solar Punk which is all</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:42.940" style="s2">this mix of Technology and green stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.570" end="00:28:46.389" style="s2">like trees and villages and small units</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.940" end="00:28:49.809" style="s2">look at the big cities you can but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.389" end="00:28:53.710" style="s2">all beautifully matched when if the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.809" end="00:28:54.550" style="s2">nature so this is something I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.710" end="00:28:56.470" style="s2">really like to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.550" end="00:29:00.190" style="s2">as opposed you know the concrete and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.470" end="00:29:02.800" style="s2">steel and everything we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.190" end="00:29:05.350" style="s2">nature and our technology is part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.800" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">nature as well so the best thing would</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.350" end="00:29:12.040" style="s2">be for them to come together and mix in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2">a artful way</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.040" end="00:29:18.730" style="s2">so that&#39;s externally and internally</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">because the post-transition</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.730" end="00:29:26.290" style="s2">we all have resources and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:31.080" style="s2">to worry about food and anything else</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.290" end="00:29:31.080" style="s2">basically for the survival for existence</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.760" end="00:29:39.790" style="s2">we struggle with jobs or anything</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.460" end="00:29:43.150" style="s2">everything&#39;s automated so what we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.790" end="00:29:46.810" style="s2">free to do is basically anything and for</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.150" end="00:29:49.180" style="s2">me it would include I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.810" end="00:29:53.400" style="s2">learn everything other languages playing</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.180" end="00:29:56.580" style="s2">instruments and talking to people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.400" end="00:30:03.630" style="s2">yeah meaningful relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.580" end="00:30:08.400" style="s2">everyone and yeah lack of fear it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.630" end="00:30:16.390" style="s2">most beautiful thing about openness</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.400" end="00:30:18.820" style="s2">vision yeah I am I agree with all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.390" end="00:30:22.390" style="s2">your sentiments and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.820" end="00:30:23.740" style="s2">those the small communities I camera</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.390" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">brought the name of it is there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.740" end="00:30:30.840" style="s2">like upper number done by a number maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">communities of no more than 150 people</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.840" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">where you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:36.550" style="s2">responsibility you talked about freedom</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:38.890" style="s2">to do anything you know I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.550" end="00:30:42.490" style="s2">with that where&#39;s that freedom is also</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.890" end="00:30:44.710" style="s2">the responsibility of working in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.490" end="00:30:48.340" style="s2">coherence with at least you&#39;re under the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.710" end="00:30:52.030" style="s2">50 person hub and perhaps there&#39;s weekly</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.340" end="00:30:54.180" style="s2">or monthly get-togethers where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.030" end="00:30:58.750" style="s2">you&#39;re all connected to the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.180" end="00:31:03.390" style="s2">you know and sharing with other local</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.750" end="00:31:06.490" style="s2">hubs you know any major decisions or</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.390" end="00:31:08.680" style="s2">changes in your local community I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.490" end="00:31:10.180" style="s2">really sure exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.680" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">you know I&#39;m kind of fleshing this out</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.180" end="00:31:17.950" style="s2">in my own little sci-fi story of how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:21.370" style="s2">know you work in harmony with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.950" end="00:31:24.100" style="s2">surrounding hubs too so and then how</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.370" end="00:31:26.500" style="s2">that might collectively happen to some</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.100" end="00:31:29.650" style="s2">degree across the planet so it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.500" end="00:31:32.620" style="s2">like there&#39;s a represent there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.650" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">representative for every you know ten</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.620" end="00:31:36.280" style="s2">thousand people or something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:39.070" style="s2">supposed to represent you on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.280" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">democratic thing maybe it&#39;s just broken</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.070" end="00:31:45.400" style="s2">up into smaller things and that creates</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.290" end="00:31:48.550" style="s2">you know like that antifragility is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.400" end="00:31:51.010" style="s2">created by more networks like the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.550" end="00:31:54.040" style="s2">mycelium works mycelial networks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.010" end="00:31:56.050" style="s2">all interconnected so we just need you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.040" end="00:31:59.170" style="s2">know more involvement and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.050" end="00:32:01.270" style="s2">interconnectedness going on throughout</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.170" end="00:32:04.360" style="s2">the system to make it more anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.270" end="00:32:08.230" style="s2">and so yes that includes breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.360" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">you know the fear of other and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.230" end="00:32:13.570" style="s2">connection and the shared humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:16.300" style="s2">those kind of pieces to kind of keep us</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.570" end="00:32:33.190" style="s2">you know that&#39;s our responsibility along</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.300" end="00:32:36.160" style="s2">with our freedom you know everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.190" end="00:32:37.660" style="s2">the planet and we care of self care of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.160" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">others care the place and care the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.660" end="00:32:44.410" style="s2">planet and I think once that&#39;s achieved</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">and people actually all the divisions</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.410" end="00:32:50.020" style="s2">and the fractures have been glued</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:52.540" style="s2">together and people get to know who</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.020" end="00:32:54.730" style="s2">everybody is and now and just and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.540" end="00:32:56.740" style="s2">the global what happens all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.730" end="00:32:58.630" style="s2">collective intelligence its global right</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.740" end="00:33:01.570" style="s2">now with it with all the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.630" end="00:33:03.550" style="s2">going on and the technology is actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.570" end="00:33:07.900" style="s2">harness in a way that will feed back</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.550" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">into the local and the individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.900" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">what I was like to see and I do have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">ideas about that yeah you&#39;ve pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:25.570" style="s2">said it all haven&#39;t you it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:28.990" style="s2">that both Yossarian and Mathias you came</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.570" end="00:33:30.420" style="s2">up with this idea of like this whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.990" end="00:33:32.440" style="s2">onic thing right so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.420" end="00:33:34.360" style="s2">connections within connections within</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.440" end="00:33:36.310" style="s2">connections and I think I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.360" end="00:33:38.410" style="s2">it everyone seems to home in on</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.310" end="00:33:40.750" style="s2">something along those lines right this</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.410" end="00:33:44.410" style="s2">interconnectedness this complex web of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.750" end="00:33:47.320" style="s2">interconnections is what sustains feeds</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.410" end="00:33:50.560" style="s2">develops protects you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.320" end="00:33:53.380" style="s2">it does it does all of those things and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.560" end="00:33:55.690" style="s2">so yeah what we are doing right now this</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.380" end="00:33:58.780" style="s2">is the this is the spores this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.690" end="00:34:01.210" style="s2">seeds of Gabey right again in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.780" end="00:34:06.610" style="s2">formation of these relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.210" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">connections with each other and the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.610" end="00:34:10.660" style="s2">Dunbar thing for me anyway you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">is specifically Assyrian it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.660" end="00:34:15.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve been on for a long time there and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:17.980" style="s2">that this works in a fractal</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.630" end="00:34:20.080" style="s2">multi-dimensional way right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.980" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">know you&#39;ve got you 150 people or</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.080" end="00:34:22.930" style="s2">whatever let&#39;s say 100 for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:24.550" style="s2">argument cuz 100 hundreds is ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.930" end="00:34:26.140" style="s2">thousand right scales really nicely but</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.550" end="00:34:28.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your hundred people that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.140" end="00:34:31.450" style="s2">live with and you rely on each other for</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.120" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">you know food and cleaning the water and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.450" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">and and dealing with the waste and blah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:36.820" style="s2">blah blah blah blah is that these</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:37.930" style="s2">communities are largely self-sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.820" end="00:34:40.630" style="s2">only maybe not a hundred percent but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.930" end="00:34:44.230" style="s2">largely self-reliant self-sustaining and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.630" end="00:34:46.270" style="s2">that members of that community are also</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.230" end="00:34:48.190" style="s2">in communities of a hundred with people</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.270" end="00:34:50.620" style="s2">who are another community so they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:52.630" style="s2">collaborate on things that affect more</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.620" end="00:34:56.500" style="s2">than just their own local community and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.630" end="00:34:58.300" style="s2">and that these things are virtually</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.500" end="00:35:00.280" style="s2">infinite in number right you create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.300" end="00:35:01.420" style="s2">massive amount of connection complexity</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.280" end="00:35:03.480" style="s2">and so to give you it gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.420" end="00:35:05.590" style="s2">opportunity to collaborate across any</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.480" end="00:35:08.740" style="s2">relevant scale right so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.590" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">building a road then this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.740" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">set of communities is involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:13.510" style="s2">and are going to benefit from it and are</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:14.680" style="s2">gonna do most of the work on it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.510" end="00:35:16.650" style="s2">whatever but if you&#39;re building I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.680" end="00:35:19.360" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.650" end="00:35:21.550" style="s2">transcontinental underground train</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.360" end="00:35:23.740" style="s2">Network right then everyone&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.550" end="00:35:25.030" style="s2">in this and so the ability to have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.740" end="00:35:27.640" style="s2">collaborations haven&#39;t had whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.030" end="00:35:29.590" style="s2">scale is needed while still affording</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.640" end="00:35:31.510" style="s2">the communities the ability to live</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.590" end="00:35:32.590" style="s2">exactly how they want to fucking live</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.510" end="00:35:34.540" style="s2">worship what they want to worship</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.590" end="00:35:35.619" style="s2">celebrate with on a celebration you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.540" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">what I mean with</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.619" end="00:35:39.849" style="s2">anyone getting in their way over there</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:41.109" style="s2">and still be able to collaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.849" end="00:35:43.779" style="s2">stuff that is going to benefit everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.109" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">with people who have totally different</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.779" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">belief systems and ways of life for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:49.420" style="s2">way they do but but but nevertheless we</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">can collaborate on this thing right</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.420" end="00:35:55.029" style="s2">because we&#39;re safe and succumbing that</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.650" style="s2">spread the idea as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.410" end="00:39:52.650" style="s2">myself right now we could you know we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.650" end="00:39:55.290" style="s2">can&#39;t have a meeting with with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.650" end="00:39:56.940" style="s2">people we can&#39;t have a meeting with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.290" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2">hundred people we actually need to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.940" end="00:40:02.820" style="s2">it probably no larger than ten to kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.060" end="00:40:04.620" style="s2">of be able to get an idea out there and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.820" end="00:40:07.550" style="s2">people ask questions to kind of get all</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.620" end="00:40:12.360" style="s2">on the same page so maybe we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.550" end="00:40:15.180" style="s2">you know little groups of ten and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.360" end="00:40:17.160" style="s2">one person from that group is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.180" end="00:40:19.800" style="s2">going to the next group or something to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.160" end="00:40:21.420" style="s2">kind of well let&#39;s say there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.800" end="00:40:28.200" style="s2">a concept called open space have you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.420" end="00:40:29.490" style="s2">heard of this because this is really</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.200" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">well because it does the mixing for you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.490" end="00:40:32.940" style="s2">automatically and it curates the system</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.070" style="s2">for you automatically as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.940" end="00:40:38.130" style="s2">the bad faith players soon get left</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.070" end="00:40:40.080" style="s2">alone in rooms right and the damage that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.130" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">bad faith players can cause is limited</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.080" end="00:40:44.040" style="s2">naturally by by people&#39;s freedom to move</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.720" style="s2">from room to room right so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.040" end="00:40:48.060" style="s2">can have a hundred people and you break</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.720" end="00:40:50.520" style="s2">them into say 25 rooms of for each right</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.060" end="00:40:51.750" style="s2">and at any given time anyone can up and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.520" end="00:40:52.950" style="s2">leave the room and they go into a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.750" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">waiting room and that once there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.950" end="00:40:58.110" style="s2">in a way soon and that becomes another</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:59.940" style="s2">room right and so it naturally mixes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.110" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">circulates people and people pick up</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.940" end="00:41:03.540" style="s2">ideas in one room which then disseminate</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:06.630" style="s2">to another room and if an idea gains</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.540" end="00:41:08.730" style="s2">traction in the general space right then</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.630" end="00:41:11.340" style="s2">it will emerge the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.730" end="00:41:12.900" style="s2">really good stuff emerges from because</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.340" end="00:41:14.520" style="s2">everyone&#39;s talking about it by the end</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.900" end="00:41:16.740" style="s2">everyone&#39;s yeah yeah yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.520" end="00:41:21.330" style="s2">really good idea and that okay okay very</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.740" end="00:41:22.620" style="s2">cool people I&#39;ve done it with 16 I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.330" end="00:41:26.250" style="s2">not tried with anything larger than that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.620" end="00:41:28.230" style="s2">but it is a very good thing about a open</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.250" end="00:41:29.820" style="s2">space meetings in Chicago I&#39;m not them</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.230" end="00:41:31.080" style="s2">for the one elf with lots of people and</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.210" end="00:41:42.410" style="s2">ideas and it&#39;s absolutely excellent but</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.320" end="00:49:13.000" style="s2">that I think I like the ambiguous miss</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.390" end="00:49:15.490" style="s2">and just being able just space between</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.000" end="00:49:17.530" style="s2">the words as a guy I talk with</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.490" end="00:49:19.390" style="s2">frequently called Ben he&#39;s he&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.530" end="00:49:21.700" style="s2">as that Kari he&#39;s exactly the same he</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.390" end="00:49:23.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he gets kind of annoyed at me</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.700" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">sometimes I hang on a minute what do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.170" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.510" end="00:49:38.170" style="s2">yeah p.m. you know duality yeah yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.730" end="00:49:40.420" style="s2">really sorry I&#39;m just gonna jump in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.170" end="00:49:42.190" style="s2">again with a notion I&#39;ve been developing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.420" end="00:49:44.770" style="s2">for a while namely that of the dance</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.190" end="00:49:46.750" style="s2">right because life the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.770" end="00:49:49.150" style="s2">life requires that you juggle and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.750" end="00:49:51.070" style="s2">balance a whole bunch of things all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.150" end="00:49:52.540" style="s2">time right and the only way to well the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.070" end="00:49:54.700" style="s2">best way I think to conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.540" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">doing of that is a dance because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.700" end="00:49:58.420" style="s2">glass never ends right you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:00.910" style="s2">learning you&#39;re always improving and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.420" end="00:50:02.320" style="s2">refining the doctor elegance and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.910" end="00:50:04.990" style="s2">its presence in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.320" end="00:50:09.550" style="s2">abandonment it&#39;s all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.990" end="00:50:11.470" style="s2">brought together in one in one vessel</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.550" end="00:50:12.730" style="s2">right there the notion and so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.470" end="00:50:14.770" style="s2">religion that isn&#39;t a religion or my</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.730" end="00:50:18.100" style="s2">religion that isn&#39;t a religion is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.770" end="00:50:20.140" style="s2">commitment to being a better dancer</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.100" end="00:50:21.610" style="s2">right learning always to try and be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.140" end="00:50:31.380" style="s2">little bit better dancer than I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.610" end="00:50:31.380" style="s2">yesterday sort of yeah something</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.540" end="00:50:41.500" style="s2">something about the language and the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.480" end="00:50:47.250" style="s2">we speak and what we say again because</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.500" end="00:50:47.250" style="s2">of the children when I started to listen</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.800" end="00:50:56.830" style="s2">listen what exactly being said I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:50:59.740" style="s2">really surprised to discover dominant</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.830" end="00:51:01.830" style="s2">patterns from the past from my parents</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.740" end="00:51:06.730" style="s2">from grandparents they all just</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.830" end="00:51:08.860" style="s2">subconsciously move and my conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.730" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">was we are the first generation that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.860" end="00:51:14.200" style="s2">actually look into this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:18.270" style="s2">and we are the first generation to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.200" end="00:51:29.500" style="s2">able to stop some patterns from</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.270" end="00:51:34.210" style="s2">repeating themselves in the language oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.500" end="00:51:36.070" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re the first I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.210" end="00:51:38.620" style="s2">been drinking ayahuasca for about seven</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.070" end="00:51:41.710" style="s2">years now and there are definitely you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.620" end="00:51:46.600" style="s2">know inherited patterns that we have in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.710" end="00:51:49.180" style="s2">our FP family um you know to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.600" end="00:51:53.050" style="s2">break some of those less than beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.180" end="00:51:55.020" style="s2">patterns is kind of a key piece to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.050" end="00:51:57.610" style="s2">know psychological and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.020" end="00:51:58.780" style="s2">well-being on a lot of levels you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.610" end="00:52:00.280" style="s2">some of them they&#39;re some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:04.530" style="s2">patterns are beautiful but you know at</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.280" end="00:52:07.210" style="s2">least that&#39;s what we at least recognize</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.530" end="00:52:09.160" style="s2">what they are where they come from is</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.210" end="00:52:11.890" style="s2">like a really key element and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.160" end="00:52:15.340" style="s2">love this the notion of sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.890" end="00:52:18.580" style="s2">knowing all of your you know your biases</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.340" end="00:52:21.690" style="s2">and your tendencies and what isn&#39;t yours</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.580" end="00:52:25.210" style="s2">things that come from society in</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.690" end="00:52:27.130" style="s2">marketing and you know maybe incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.210" end="00:52:29.260" style="s2">thought in your family history too but</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.130" end="00:52:32.950" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.260" end="00:52:36.670" style="s2">pieces and like the I don&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.950" end="00:52:38.530" style="s2">term the the unn looked at life it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.670" end="00:52:41.050" style="s2">that it&#39;s not unlooked at the unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.530" end="00:52:44.490" style="s2">look times unexamined the unexamined</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.050" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">life is not worth living on so yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.490" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">if we&#39;re doing quotes</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:49.510" style="s2">something master I meant to say it</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:52.300" style="s2">earlier but when Matthews was talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.510" end="00:52:54.490" style="s2">about the basically resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.300" end="00:52:57.060" style="s2">economic is a good I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.490" end="00:52:59.500" style="s2">a quote from Jacque fresco where he said</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.060" end="00:53:01.480" style="s2">if there&#39;s a problem in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.500" end="00:53:03.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t make a profit from solving it</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.480" end="00:53:13.750" style="s2">then that problem will remain unsolved</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.670" end="00:53:15.940" style="s2">yeah yeah pretty nicely pretty nicely I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.750" end="00:53:18.250" style="s2">would take it one step further even</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.940" end="00:53:20.200" style="s2">worse if there is money to be made by</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.250" end="00:53:24.190" style="s2">creating problems in the world then</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.200" end="00:53:26.020" style="s2">people will create those problems you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.190" end="00:53:28.540" style="s2">know when you look at marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.020" end="00:53:32.200" style="s2">advertisement industry they do create</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.540" end="00:53:35.619" style="s2">problems yeah obsolescence is basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.200" end="00:53:37.810" style="s2">creating problems for consumers so there</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.619" end="00:53:40.150" style="s2">is not a chance that some equipment</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.810" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">actually works for longer than the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.150" end="00:53:49.270" style="s2">warranty said sure yeah craziness</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:51.670" style="s2">yeah I saw this German guy comment but</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.270" end="00:53:53.230" style="s2">what his name is YouTube guy and he was</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.670" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">talking about exactly this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.230" end="00:53:56.740" style="s2">obsolescence it&#39;s everywhere new suits</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:59.170" style="s2">he was talking about printer cartridges</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.740" end="00:54:01.660" style="s2">he&#39;s saying I the printer says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.170" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">no ink left in the cartridge but built</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.660" end="00:54:04.570" style="s2">into the cartridge this little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.490" style="s2">counsel right and then when the counsel</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.570" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">reaches a thousand or whatever it says</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.490" end="00:54:09.730" style="s2">the cartridge is empty but it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:11.020" style="s2">all you reset the counter you can reset</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.730" end="00:54:13.780" style="s2">the counsel like two three sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.020" end="00:54:15.400" style="s2">four times and the cartridge will</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.780" end="00:54:16.930" style="s2">continue to work so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.400" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">telling you to dispose of and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.930" end="00:54:21.640" style="s2">one where you can refill the ink rise a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:25.480" style="s2">disposable anyway so yeah it built built</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.640" end="00:54:30.010" style="s2">in at every level wasting resources in</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.480" end="00:54:33.310" style="s2">order to get yeah yeah absolutely me to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.010" end="00:54:35.770" style="s2">quite right good man for saying so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.310" end="00:54:38.859" style="s2">any any other the only adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.770" end="00:54:43.030" style="s2">Possible&#39;s I can think of that are sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.859" end="00:54:45.369" style="s2">of doable and of value taking a sport is</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.030" end="00:54:48.040" style="s2">community type experiments right that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.369" end="00:54:50.020" style="s2">sort of level getting 50 people together</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:54.150" style="s2">whatever and try and create a community</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.020" end="00:54:56.740" style="s2">on which you can rely not only for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.150" end="00:55:00.700" style="s2">material necessities of life but also</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.740" end="00:55:04.450" style="s2">for your you know social spirit</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.700" end="00:55:06.280" style="s2">emotional needs as well right and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.450" end="00:55:07.870" style="s2">figure out how to make that work because</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.280" end="00:55:09.190" style="s2">communities break down all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.870" end="00:55:11.530" style="s2">this has been tried many many many times</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.190" end="00:55:13.000" style="s2">in most communities break apart right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.530" end="00:55:14.590" style="s2">because people simply can&#39;t get on with</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.000" end="00:55:16.780" style="s2">each other in close proximity for long</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.590" end="00:55:19.720" style="s2">periods of time and so figuring out a</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.780" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">framework in which people can do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.720" end="00:55:26.050" style="s2">and not just select groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:29.170" style="s2">perfectly blended right but that broadly</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.050" end="00:55:31.000" style="s2">speaking groups can do that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.170" end="00:55:33.070" style="s2">is the most important adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.000" end="00:55:35.050" style="s2">sort of thing we could be doing here</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.070" end="00:55:41.050" style="s2">here&#39;s that here&#39;s the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.050" end="00:55:42.370" style="s2">community is that really to have let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.050" end="00:55:46.780" style="s2">just say there was only a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.370" end="00:55:49.000" style="s2">on the planet what would you need in for</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.780" end="00:55:51.220" style="s2">those hundred people to have kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.000" end="00:55:54.670" style="s2">best you know technological and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.220" end="00:55:57.910" style="s2">emotionally balanced and fed and safe</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.670" end="00:56:00.430" style="s2">people you know you would need you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.910" end="00:56:03.580" style="s2">some measure of engineers and some</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.430" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">builders and some gardeners and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.580" end="00:56:08.500" style="s2">some educators and some maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:10.510" style="s2">artists you know maybe don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.500" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">artists but you know that you ideally</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.510" end="00:56:17.380" style="s2">you want you have to do you need Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:18.970" style="s2">in your world so I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.380" end="00:56:20.800" style="s2">should structure it in like oh well this</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.970" end="00:56:22.420" style="s2">person also believes and looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.800" end="00:56:24.310" style="s2">wound averse just the way I do so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.420" end="00:56:26.380" style="s2">gonna surround myself with that what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.310" end="00:56:28.690" style="s2">actually need to look at is to structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.380" end="00:56:31.600" style="s2">your communities having all of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.690" end="00:56:33.430" style="s2">necessary tools within it you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.600" end="00:56:35.710" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s certainly one level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.430" end="00:56:39.490" style="s2">certainly one level but conflict</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.710" end="00:56:41.020" style="s2">resolution you know is a is a key thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.490" end="00:56:42.430" style="s2">I mean you&#39;re absolutely right balancing</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.020" end="00:56:44.830" style="s2">there balancing the skill sets is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.430" end="00:56:46.390" style="s2">obviously crucial that that&#39;s a step</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.830" end="00:56:49.780" style="s2">number one almost you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.390" end="00:56:51.700" style="s2">and yeah think of figuring out ways in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.780" end="00:56:53.530" style="s2">which because conflicts will arise right</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.700" end="00:56:54.760" style="s2">either to try and pretend that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.530" end="00:56:56.830" style="s2">all gonna get on perfectly all the time</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.760" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">this is just nonsense right conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.830" end="00:57:01.090" style="s2">will arise they&#39;re going to arise all</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">the time in all kinds of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.090" end="00:57:10.750" style="s2">and so building in that like we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:12.370" style="s2">always on the lookout not for not not to</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.750" end="00:57:13.840" style="s2">conflict so that we can diffuse it but</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.370" end="00:57:14.360" style="s2">conflict so that we can turn their</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.840" end="00:57:16.070" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.360" end="00:57:17.840" style="s2">into something constructive you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.070" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">what I mean like friction if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.840" end="00:57:20.060" style="s2">fit if you&#39;ve got any sort of physics</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:22.250" style="s2">you understand that friction is what</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.060" end="00:57:23.510" style="s2">creates for motion right it&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.250" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">rubber hits the road it&#39;s the friction</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.510" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">which pushes the vehicle forward right</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:30.410" style="s2">and so you need that you need that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:31.730" style="s2">friction but you you can&#39;t have it just</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.410" end="00:57:33.350" style="s2">dissipate as heat</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.730" end="00:57:37.300" style="s2">you know people shouting at each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.350" end="00:57:39.890" style="s2">you need sir you need to channel it into</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.300" end="00:57:42.200" style="s2">motion right into into actual</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.890" end="00:57:44.990" style="s2">constructive forward motion and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.200" end="00:57:49.190" style="s2">figuring out how to do that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.990" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">to me to be a but I think you can only</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.190" end="00:57:53.380" style="s2">really do that by experimenting in good</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:57.980" style="s2">faith and finding people willing to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.380" end="00:57:59.210" style="s2">gauging those sorts of experiments most</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.980" end="00:58:03.080" style="s2">people are closed lots of people of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.210" end="00:58:05.150" style="s2">goodwill that fails and rivalry that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.080" end="00:58:07.010" style="s2">that&#39;s like it yeah very well to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.150" end="00:58:08.270" style="s2">concept that&#39;s ER to live it when people</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.010" end="00:58:09.170" style="s2">are pissing you off you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.270" end="00:58:16.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.170" end="00:58:18.110" style="s2">no it&#39;s challenging but for sure we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.490" end="00:58:20.750" style="s2">got about two minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.110" end="00:58:22.040" style="s2">I mean listen I&#39;m not thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.750" end="00:58:23.390" style="s2">time we can talk for as long as we want</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.040" end="00:58:26.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how thingy Jubilees gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.390" end="00:58:28.010" style="s2">be about the time you know planning on</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.030" end="00:58:29.390" style="s2">bringing us all together to maybe mix up</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.010" end="00:58:31.730" style="s2">a little bit I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.390" end="00:58:32.900" style="s2">her plan is I&#39;m sorry I arrived a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.730" end="00:58:38.030" style="s2">bit late so we didn&#39;t have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.900" end="00:58:44.270" style="s2">talk beforehand so about the voting and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.030" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">the word and what voting is at least to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.270" end="00:58:51.460" style="s2">me and generally well 14 us as you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2">a split in the whatever community and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.460" end="00:58:56.060" style="s2">the voting is like a final decision</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:58.540" style="s2">people vote and then it&#39;s either this</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.060" end="00:59:02.650" style="s2">way or that way and some part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.540" end="00:59:05.480" style="s2">the group is going to be less happy and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.650" end="00:59:11.030" style="s2">the other is going to be more happy but</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.480" end="00:59:14.780" style="s2">it&#39;s very binary the choices can be and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.030" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">usually are on purpose sometimes even in</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.780" end="00:59:26.050" style="s2">politics so well divide and conquer</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:28.250" style="s2">right change in the language and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.050" end="00:59:31.849" style="s2">switching from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.250" end="00:59:35.869" style="s2">all that so some things that amplified</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.849" end="00:59:42.109" style="s2">and some things that allowed but right</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.869" end="00:59:45.970" style="s2">downregulated ya de-emphasize do ya go</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.109" end="00:59:48.710" style="s2">on the leaves the field still open to</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.970" end="00:59:51.050" style="s2">evil majority wants to go this way</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.710" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect but the door is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.050" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">closed for the other other direction so</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="01:00:03.050" style="s2">yeah the problem with democracy in</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:06.320" style="s2">general for me is that there is whenever</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.050" end="01:00:09.020" style="s2">a choice is made is everyone is supposed</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.320" end="01:00:10.250" style="s2">to follow and in some cases it makes</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.020" end="01:00:12.230" style="s2">sense if you are talking about I know</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.250" end="01:00:17.170" style="s2">cream you know something like that but</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.230" end="01:00:23.660" style="s2">if you are talking about some soft</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.170" end="01:00:26.420" style="s2">subjects then worry not majority it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.660" end="01:00:30.080" style="s2">wants to go this way surely of course</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.420" end="01:00:31.930" style="s2">but if minority wants to do some other</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.080" end="01:00:36.800" style="s2">things why not</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.930" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">so amplification and the emphasizing it</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.800" end="01:00:45.910" style="s2">makes a huge change in how people can</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:49.310" style="s2">think about this oh yeah so how do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.910" end="01:00:52.040" style="s2">how do you you know let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.310" end="01:00:54.619" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bunch of you know just</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.040" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">using your example there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.619" end="01:00:57.410" style="s2">people that are white nationalists you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:00:59.000" style="s2">know man they&#39;re really I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.410" end="01:01:01.099" style="s2">overblown here in the United States like</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.000" end="01:01:05.060" style="s2">yes there&#39;s some race issues you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.099" end="01:01:07.070" style="s2">this is obviously highly disputed I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.060" end="01:01:08.990" style="s2">progressive leftist in general but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.070" end="01:01:12.080" style="s2">think that even the left right now is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.990" end="01:01:14.150" style="s2">going a little bit overboard and the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.080" end="01:01:16.130" style="s2">language that is being used is being</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.150" end="01:01:18.770" style="s2">intentionally focused into a really</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.130" end="01:01:21.320" style="s2">tight narrow area of of pure white</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.770" end="01:01:23.390" style="s2">racism which you know Trump is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.320" end="01:01:24.410" style="s2">embodying and there&#39;s some elements and</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.390" end="01:01:26.390" style="s2">you know I&#39;m kind of a little bit off on</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.410" end="01:01:32.109" style="s2">tangent here but how do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.390" end="01:01:35.869" style="s2">for example honor people&#39;s right to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.109" end="01:01:41.480" style="s2">you know believe that that the white</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.869" end="01:01:42.410" style="s2">race is better than other races you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.480" end="01:01:43.910" style="s2">what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.410" end="01:01:47.299" style="s2">say like well you&#39;ve got to live in</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.910" end="01:01:48.650" style="s2">Arkansas you know maybe freeze believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.299" end="01:01:50.690" style="s2">whatever they want if people want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.650" end="01:01:52.900" style="s2">believe in case they go ahead and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.690" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">believe that what they can&#39;t do is</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.900" end="01:01:56.630" style="s2">oppress people who are not white right</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:01:58.130" style="s2">but if they want to live in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.630" end="01:02:00.140" style="s2">community with other white people and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.130" end="01:02:01.549" style="s2">sing songs about how much better white</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.140" end="01:02:03.619" style="s2">people are than everybody else is right</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.549" end="01:02:05.990" style="s2">if that&#39;s their thing let it be their</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.619" end="01:02:08.660" style="s2">thing so they&#39;re not actually pressing</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.990" end="01:02:11.150" style="s2">any to me neither there&#39;s the line comes</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.660" end="01:02:14.359" style="s2">when those white supremacists actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.150" end="01:02:16.970" style="s2">have the power to influence the way that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.359" end="01:02:19.010" style="s2">other people who are not them the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.970" end="01:02:20.270" style="s2">that their lives go right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.010" end="01:02:21.500" style="s2">where the problem lies it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.270" end="01:02:26.809" style="s2">beliefs it&#39;s and the actions that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.500" end="01:02:29.569" style="s2">can take in the world the problem and of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.809" end="01:02:31.700" style="s2">course we do have it in Poland like</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.569" end="01:02:36.890" style="s2">traditionally because obviously our</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.700" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">nation is the best and that&#39;s every</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:48.950" style="s2">other nation but there&#39;s like terms of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:51.020" style="s2">racism which is not even grounded in any</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.950" end="01:02:53.660" style="s2">you know most of the racist here just</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.020" end="01:02:55.430" style="s2">never had any contact with like people</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.660" end="01:02:57.170" style="s2">of color and they still hate them</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.430" end="01:03:08.660" style="s2">because they don&#39;t know them which kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.170" end="01:03:11.359" style="s2">of works and I I switch from thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.660" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">that well freedom of speech obviously</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:21.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very important and as long as</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">they just say that the white rice is</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.650" end="01:03:32.599" style="s2">supreme and stuff like that they should</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:35.240" style="s2">be I mean there&#39;s no way to forbid them</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.599" end="01:03:40.869" style="s2">from thinking it and we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.240" end="01:03:44.539" style="s2">control and I think of course but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.869" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say is the path from</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.539" end="01:03:51.079" style="s2">just singing songs and thinking whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:55.099" style="s2">they think so actually attacking</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.079" end="01:03:56.180" style="s2">violence on other people it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.099" end="01:03:59.450" style="s2">straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.180" end="01:04:02.290" style="s2">because even some things that are being</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.450" end="01:04:06.710" style="s2">said in public space by politicians and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.290" end="01:04:16.520" style="s2">some people who are not even white</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.710" end="01:04:21.170" style="s2">supremacists but they just think yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.520" end="01:04:24.200" style="s2">they held out views which are even not</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.170" end="01:04:27.770" style="s2">really racist but subconsciously kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.200" end="01:04:31.550" style="s2">we are better and there is something</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.770" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">about publicly speaking and being in</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.550" end="01:04:44.059" style="s2">public space which is not violence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:49.010" style="s2">not just by being that the balance is</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.059" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">tipped towards possibility of violent</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.010" end="01:04:56.540" style="s2">future to describe it but edit this is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:58.819" style="s2">problem because as long as much as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.540" end="01:05:02.270" style="s2">happy for people to think whatever they</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.819" end="01:05:12.920" style="s2">want it&#39;s obvious to me that the freedom</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.270" end="01:05:15.530" style="s2">of what you say and how you behave I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.920" end="01:05:17.540" style="s2">really like consequences on others and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.530" end="01:05:19.190" style="s2">think if you can just be mindful about</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.540" end="01:05:20.690" style="s2">what you say you may believe in</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.190" end="01:05:22.670" style="s2">something but if you want to be like</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.690" end="01:05:24.440" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m gonna say this because</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.670" end="01:05:26.809" style="s2">I&#39;ve got free speech and I really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.440" end="01:05:28.520" style="s2">give a shit do you get yes in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.809" end="01:05:30.440" style="s2">process but I think you&#39;ve gotta be</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.520" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">mindful about what you say and who you</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.440" end="01:05:35.540" style="s2">say to and now you say it because yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:37.220" style="s2">yeah your actions and your words can</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.540" end="01:05:39.740" style="s2">actually have consequences and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.220" end="01:05:41.750" style="s2">although other people you know I mean so</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.740" end="01:05:44.240" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve got to think of how maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.750" end="01:05:45.770" style="s2">with this what I&#39;m sayin now would that</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.240" end="01:05:47.569" style="s2">might affect somebody else and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.770" end="01:05:48.109" style="s2">maybe I would think about that to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.569" end="01:05:51.049" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.109" end="01:05:53.299" style="s2">um and then so I choose not to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.049" end="01:05:55.190" style="s2">like you know but as I said I just think</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.299" end="01:05:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I&#39;m free to say what I</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.190" end="01:06:00.950" style="s2">like so I&#39;ll just say what I like like</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.119" end="01:06:04.250" style="s2">Jordan Peterson carries sounds just like</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.950" end="01:06:05.809" style="s2">Jordan Peterson on right he&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.250" end="01:06:07.809" style="s2">well because he would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.809" end="01:06:09.710" style="s2">freedom of speech comes along with a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.809" end="01:06:11.750" style="s2">responsibility to speak</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.710" end="01:06:15.080" style="s2">truthfully right and to speak honorably</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.750" end="01:06:16.730" style="s2">and you cannot decouple these two things</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.080" end="01:06:17.630" style="s2">from each other they are two sides of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.730" end="01:06:19.580" style="s2">the same coin</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.630" end="01:06:22.220" style="s2">you&#39;re free to speak is my</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.580" end="01:06:23.390" style="s2">responsibility to afford you space in</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.220" end="01:06:26.660" style="s2">which to sense your honor man but it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.390" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">also your responsibility not to waste my</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.660" end="01:06:30.680" style="s2">time and others with stupid speech Jenny</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:33.109" style="s2">no I&#39;m truthful speech with country</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.680" end="01:06:34.940" style="s2">speech then you cannot decouple the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.109" end="01:06:36.500" style="s2">freedom from the responsibility the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.940" end="01:06:38.420" style="s2">salient we become irresponsible with</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.500" end="01:06:40.310" style="s2">free speech and you weaponize it so use</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.420" end="01:06:43.400" style="s2">it as I can say whatever the fuck I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.310" end="01:06:46.940" style="s2">because of free speech right weaponize</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.400" end="01:06:48.380" style="s2">it in that way then you bring people</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.940" end="01:06:50.119" style="s2">from the other side say hang on a minute</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.380" end="01:06:51.859" style="s2">you can&#39;t say that that&#39;s not what free</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.119" end="01:06:53.240" style="s2">speech was intended for that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.859" end="01:06:55.430" style="s2">malicious and now you have people</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.240" end="01:06:57.410" style="s2">questioning whether there should be free</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.430" end="01:06:59.150" style="s2">speech because being not exposing their</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.410" end="01:07:02.869" style="s2">responsibility to use it wisely right</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.150" end="01:07:05.180" style="s2">and so the thing creates itself you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.869" end="01:07:06.800" style="s2">I think I think that&#39;s what I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.180" end="01:07:12.080" style="s2">to save up wanting to say it probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.800" end="01:07:15.560" style="s2">ended up with one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.080" end="01:07:17.780" style="s2">things I&#39;ve written so far you know in</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.560" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">in this first kind of chapter and a half</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.780" end="01:07:22.790" style="s2">of this book I&#39;m writing is you know one</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.910" style="s2">of the characters is a 16 year old kid</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.790" end="01:07:28.430" style="s2">living with his family and you know he</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.910" end="01:07:30.740" style="s2">goes through basically seven initiations</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.430" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">until he&#39;s considered a full adult</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.740" end="01:07:36.260" style="s2">that&#39;s allowed to you know be a part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:38.200" style="s2">the world community the greater world</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.260" end="01:07:40.609" style="s2">community and it&#39;s kind of this evolving</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.200" end="01:07:42.440" style="s2">network of groups so first it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.609" end="01:07:45.349" style="s2">family and then you know you start</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.440" end="01:07:46.910" style="s2">interacting there&#39;s neighbors you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.349" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">to have all there&#39;s kind of rules and</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.910" end="01:07:54.589" style="s2">responsibilities you know guidelines and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:57.170" style="s2">responsibilities and ways to you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.589" end="01:08:00.080" style="s2">methods of Education that make them a</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.170" end="01:08:03.800" style="s2">more holistic minded person as they get</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.080" end="01:08:06.760" style="s2">older so one of the stages at you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.800" end="01:08:09.260" style="s2">I&#39;m I think I&#39;m calling it the fifth</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.760" end="01:08:11.330" style="s2">initiation that you go through is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.260" end="01:08:14.599" style="s2">you actually spend two years abroad and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.330" end="01:08:16.580" style="s2">you it&#39;s in four locations you get to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.599" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">pick two of them and then your parents</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.580" end="01:08:21.410" style="s2">get to pick two of them recently just</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:23.420" style="s2">yesterday the day before I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.410" end="01:08:27.860" style="s2">exactly the idea somewhere else where</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.420" end="01:08:29.210" style="s2">in the collective weird it&#39;s so weird</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.860" end="01:08:31.040" style="s2">that you&#39;ve come up with this entirely</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.210" end="01:08:33.950" style="s2">independently it&#39;s so weird</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.040" end="01:08:35.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s like I&#39;m has come</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.950" end="01:08:37.100" style="s2">all you know and I&#39;ve been frustrated by</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.810" end="01:08:38.360" style="s2">this before I&#39;ll come up with some time</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.100" end="01:08:39.800" style="s2">like oh my god I&#39;m gonna do this and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.360" end="01:08:47.210" style="s2">I&#39;ll start looking around it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.800" end="01:08:48.320" style="s2">someone just did it like collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.210" end="01:08:50.870" style="s2">tools and trying to put together</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.320" end="01:08:53.750" style="s2">something and the number 7 keeps coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.870" end="01:08:55.820" style="s2">up what&#39;s like so I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.750" end="01:08:58.460" style="s2">there&#39;s the chakras and within the wound</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.820" end="01:09:04.760" style="s2">averse and then there&#39;s you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.460" end="01:09:07.280" style="s2">that I can&#39;t know there&#39;s the different</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.760" end="01:09:09.470" style="s2">developmental stages that Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.280" end="01:09:12.110" style="s2">talks about as well and actually he has</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.470" end="01:09:14.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m taking the top one off because</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.110" end="01:09:18.320" style="s2">it is actually the most considered the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.210" end="01:09:21.110" style="s2">most woo of the stages so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.320" end="01:09:23.090" style="s2">Allah would it just be like something</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.110" end="01:09:24.740" style="s2">that perhaps comes after those at that</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.090" end="01:09:26.510" style="s2">seventh stage of development and we</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.740" end="01:09:29.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is yet because of</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.510" end="01:09:31.610" style="s2">course none of us really know when what</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.300" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">the truth is in terms of the whoo right</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.610" end="01:09:53.330" style="s2">so anyway we don&#39;t know is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:59.800" style="s2">manipulation most of the time because by</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.330" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">definition and work this notion that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.800" end="01:10:06.650" style="s2">can only know the higher spirit to which</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:08.750" style="s2">you are equal sometimes and what it</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.650" end="01:10:12.200" style="s2">means is it&#39;s not even about knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.750" end="01:10:17.660" style="s2">is about ability to recognize and</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.200" end="01:10:20.870" style="s2">perceive stuff only that you your cause</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.660" end="01:10:24.490" style="s2">and mind construction is actually able</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.870" end="01:10:32.140" style="s2">to so the knowledge and being becomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.490" end="01:10:36.590" style="s2">one and yeah I&#39;m not really upset but</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.140" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">yeah we cannot if we were able to know</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.590" end="01:10:50.329" style="s2">the rule</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:52.820" style="s2">we&#39;ll be the whoo our selves I tend to</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.329" end="01:10:55.250" style="s2">believe which is that actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.820" end="01:10:58.750" style="s2">nothing really super natural like yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.250" end="01:10:58.750" style="s2">there may indeed be something that will</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.010" end="01:11:04.940" style="s2">once we figure it out whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.690" end="01:11:07.159" style="s2">science or some kind of intuitive arts</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.940" end="01:11:09.170" style="s2">and stuff it&#39;s no longer supernatural I</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.159" end="01:11:11.630" style="s2">mean just look around the world this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.170" end="01:11:16.550" style="s2">pretty magical no matter how you look at</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.630" end="01:11:18.110" style="s2">it so it&#39;s advanced technology is</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.550" end="01:11:24.590" style="s2">indistinguishable from magic</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.110" end="01:11:27.949" style="s2">I need to go I&#39;ve got stuff to do I&#39;ve</p>
