<p begin="00:00:00.709" end="00:00:05.580" style="s2">hi my name is Joe brewer and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.689" end="00:00:08.010" style="s2">talk with you for a moment about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.580" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">power of design for solving the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">most difficult problems now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">commonly thought that design is</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">something that applies to making cute</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">trinkets or too pretty making pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">pictures or to making dessert products</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">that work in a certain way what I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">to do is suggest that design is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:30.380" style="s2">something much deeper than that see</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:32.910" style="s2">design is a process through which one</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.380" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">establishes the criteria for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.910" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">system to work in a particular way so</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">for example we have a global financial</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">system designed specifically to work a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">certain way principally to take the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">abrogation of capital or money and use</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">it to leverage that capital to generate</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">more capital or more money and that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">something that is a set by design to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">make the priority that money generation</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">from money is the primary outcome for</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.909" style="s2">that whole system now there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">fair amount of recognition that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.909" end="00:01:09.659" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the best way to design an</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">economy and that there might be a better</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.659" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">ways to think of what a financial system</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">should do and our financial system</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">should be designed and so in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">the discussion of design isn&#39;t simply</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:24.650" style="s2">about aesthetics it isn&#39;t simply about</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">selling products it&#39;s about identifying</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.650" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">the deep underlying motivations for</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">creating a set of human activities and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">for considering how the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">structures the procedures the rules for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">that system should be set up to operate</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">to achieve some goals or some outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">that are deemed preferable over others</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.009" end="00:01:50.909" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about designing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">financial system this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.909" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about in a more general</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">sense when we consider that the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">pressing challenges in the world whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">it&#39;s from climate change having</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">potentially catastrophic effects for</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">human civilization or it&#39;s the depletion</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">of vital resources that our entire</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">economy depends upon such as oil or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">increasing scarcity of water</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">or rare earth metals that are used for</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">making electronics it just does a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:24.360" style="s2">of examples that in considering these</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">really challenging problems the only way</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.360" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">that we could envision a solution is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">bring the methods of design to both</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:35.540" style="s2">critique what the nature the problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:38.310" style="s2">are and where they come from and also to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.540" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">inspire the kinds of solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.310" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">desirable and we&#39;re already starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:46.650" style="s2">see this for example to go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">financial sector there&#39;s been a growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:52.340" style="s2">recognition that finance is set up in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">way that is oftentimes antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.340" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">democratic process by which I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">those who have money have undue or</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">unfair influence over public systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">over government and so those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:09.960" style="s2">have money you don&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">leverage aggregated capital for</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.960" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">influencing political outcomes they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">at a distinct disadvantage and so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">creation of a financial system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:22.830" style="s2">working quote-unquote properly by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">design criteria I mentioned earlier will</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.830" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">lead to outcomes that are antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:31.110" style="s2">to democracy so there&#39;s this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">going on now about how a financial</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.110" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">system can be designed to become more</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.580" style="s2">democratic and one of the areas that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:42.180" style="s2">particularly interesting to look at is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.580" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">at the intersection between small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.180" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">financing what&#39;s often called micro</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">financing and what might also be called</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">participatory finance the most common</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">version of that being crowdfunding where</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:58.820" style="s2">a large number of people each contribute</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">small amounts of money but interact in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.820" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">in a direct and active way with the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">that the money is spent and what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">activities that come out of the money</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">that&#39;s aggregated by that process so</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of collaboration that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:16.080" style="s2">happens so in this sense there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">design criteria being explored to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:21.200" style="s2">discover what they are and how they work</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:24.510" style="s2">that would promote a more interactive</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.200" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">democratic and empowering approach to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.510" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">pooling in spin</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">money often times with specific social</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:34.090" style="s2">goods such as reducing poverty</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.610" style="s2">increasing human well-being or</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:39.790" style="s2">addressing environmental concerns become</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.610" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">the measures of success so in situations</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.790" end="00:04:44.410" style="s2">like these it becomes increasingly clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:47.830" style="s2">that considerations of design are at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.410" end="00:04:50.650" style="s2">center of the discussion so anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.830" end="00:04:53.530" style="s2">wants to engage in solving the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.650" end="00:04:56.650" style="s2">problems is going to need to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.530" end="00:05:00.970" style="s2">about design and is going to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.650" end="00:05:03.430" style="s2">designer in considering what those webs</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.970" end="00:05:05.050" style="s2">of human activities and the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.430" end="00:05:09.640" style="s2">kind of architecting of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.050" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">are where they&#39;re deficient and what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.640" end="00:05:13.210" style="s2">motivations are to solve them this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">something that I&#39;m of course quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.210" end="00:05:18.340" style="s2">interested in seeing more of and as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.550" end="00:05:20.620" style="s2">designer myself seek to bring insights</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.340" end="00:05:24.010" style="s2">from cognitive science and Earth System</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.620" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">science and from organizational strategy</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.010" end="00:05:28.930" style="s2">and social change to bear on global</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:30.940" style="s2">problems but I&#39;m by no means the only</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">one doing this there&#39;s an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.940" end="00:05:35.140" style="s2">number of people who recognize that many</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">of the problems in that we have in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.140" end="00:05:40.770" style="s2">world whether ecological or social or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">political economic or what have you or</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.770" end="00:05:46.870" style="s2">what might be considered to be symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:51.250" style="s2">of bad design and that good design can</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.870" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">help to solve them so that&#39;s just a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.250" end="00:05:55.750" style="s2">of thinking about how design can help</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.380" end="00:05:58.150" style="s2">solve global problems and I hope that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.750" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">encourages you to put on your design hat</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.150" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">roll up your sleeves and get involved</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">thank you</p>
