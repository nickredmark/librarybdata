<p begin="00:00:01.829" end="00:00:10.469" style="s2">government watchdogs that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.910" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">so that was kind of more of the EPA this</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.469" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">also I think we need to take back the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">FDA and I don&#39;t know what the caning</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">quick montage that&#39;s happened but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">federal drug administered to where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">trust the government we assume that if</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">it&#39;s on our shelves it&#39;s safe this goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">back to the product app but making sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">that we know I don&#39;t think people</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">realize how much testing is not done</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">that a lot of times not as so much in</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">food but in other things we put into our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:42.750" style="s2">environment that from what I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">companies are allowed to just make it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.750" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">until it&#39;s proven to be problematic as</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">opposed to in the opposite way where you</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">have to prove that it&#39;s benign before</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">you can put it into the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">create it so just having that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:58.760" style="s2">information just about the FDA so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">actual things that are more regulated</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.760" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">find you know what has been seen to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">safe is aspartame safe how do we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">that not we take the FDA stamp of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">approval but like what tests were done</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">who paid for those tests what did those</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">tests say what tests have been done</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">further on it should it be okay what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:21.720" style="s2">countries have allowed it what countries</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t allowed it what&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">reasoning and seeing okay the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">for every single chemical and additive I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">mean maybe it can be done for things</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">like salt and baking soda that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">natural as well but a finding out what</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">is safe and what&#39;s not I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">know if there&#39;s been any studies that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">show salt itself is it&#39;s been done</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">studies in salt what am I talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">and shown just like sodium itself being</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">able to see more so what the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">that MSG is it safe is it safe for</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">everyone is a safer certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">people just being able to tell what</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">process was gone through to show that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">it&#39;s safe so you can say yep the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">government did their due diligence or</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:08.090" style="s2">they didn&#39;t and we need more further</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:10.730" style="s2">study I think that is an important</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.090" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">aspect of our lives we need to take back</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.730" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">immediately from our governor</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">that was a couple number eight</p>
