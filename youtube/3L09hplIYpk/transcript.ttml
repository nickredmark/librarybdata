<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:06.690" style="s2">I had an insight this morning down at</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.060" end="00:00:14.759" style="s2">the barn shoveling poop so if you think</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.690" end="00:00:18.140" style="s2">of culture as a grouping you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.759" end="00:00:21.810" style="s2">say Christian culture Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.140" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">Catholicism as a culture or being an</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">American as a culture or certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">language you know I primarily defined</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">cultures language norms in taboo you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">think of it as a grouping then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">people there&#39;s then that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">you know think of as culture and when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">think of a collective I think of like if</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">you had all these little dots inside of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">the culture and then in this grouping</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">had all these little dots the collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">was not something that was defined by</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">this context but was enacted in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">participatory manner so if this person</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">in this cultural grouping was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:11.240" style="s2">this person was talking to this person</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">was talking to this person then in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.240" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">that time that duration to it during</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">which they were participating they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:26.030" style="s2">actually something that wasn&#39;t bounded</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">but that was a morphic resonance and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.030" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">so was it was inherently cross-boundary</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">right so if you and I were in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">participatory discussion like we are now</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">and we were in from profoundly different</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.180" style="s2">cultures then I would say that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">participatory field not a cultural field</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.180" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">so I started to think of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">as and I started to see some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">confusion in some of the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">traditions because the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">traditions have always rejected culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">as an intermediary so most of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">spiritual traditions you do individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">practice and then that brings you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the microcosmic level and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">gives you insight into the macrocosmic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:20.659" style="s2">cosmological and they&#39;ve always rejected</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">the culture as being I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.659" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">secular culture as being immediate me</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">Thierry the mistake that they make</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">though is than they made their religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">traditions or their lineages bound</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">identities and so what my insight was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:46.919" style="s2">the possibility that this new emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">field a participatory collective that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.919" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">being enacted in real time was like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:57.629" style="s2">miso cosmic order so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:03:00.419" style="s2">microcosmic than the macrocosmic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.629" end="00:03:05.510" style="s2">what was emerging was this miso cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.419" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">order and that solved another problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.510" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">another new conceptual nuisance that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:18.659" style="s2">I&#39;ve had and that was this concept that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">that when you move from the microcosmic</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.659" end="00:03:25.979" style="s2">story of the individual enlightenment to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:30.419" style="s2">the macrocosmic story of cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.979" end="00:03:37.199" style="s2">let&#39;s say evolutionary spirituality then</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.419" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t derive a planetary ethos right</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.199" end="00:03:42.769" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s there&#39;s no mezzo</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:45.689" style="s2">structure in between and so with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.769" end="00:03:47.479" style="s2">collective participatory collective you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.689" end="00:03:51.090" style="s2">could actually participate on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.479" end="00:03:54.030" style="s2">planetary scale and so the story the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:55.949" style="s2">cosmological story story has to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.030" end="00:03:58.889" style="s2">through like the geo history of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.949" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">planet the planet in the earth story</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.889" end="00:04:04.469" style="s2">with the is the story that we shared the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:08.699" style="s2">cosmology so it kind of fit nicely into</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.469" end="00:04:11.539" style="s2">this planetary ethos I had so just just</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.699" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">kind of making this distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.539" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">the collective as a participatory thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">and culture as it arises in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:25.289" style="s2">evolutionary history as an exclusionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">principle was a little insight that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.289" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">had that I think I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">to use at least for a little while until</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:40.350" style="s2">it becomes its own conceptual nuisance</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">huh oh my i really felt fit that felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.350" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">good and true yeah feels good it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:58.010" style="s2">some radical implications it means like</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">you know it says don&#39;t look for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.010" end="00:05:05.240" style="s2">answers in statism or nation nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:08.580" style="s2">or in the United Nations or in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.240" end="00:05:12.540" style="s2">interfaith dialogue right because all</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.580" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">those bounded cultures are there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.540" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">confusion in what we&#39;ve been waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:20.250" style="s2">you know what we&#39;ve been waiting for is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">this other sense and this kind of fits</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.250" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">into your thing about theatre people</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:28.110" style="s2">because it&#39;s a if you think of identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">of the collective as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.110" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">constantly enacted it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">fluid I forgot how you started off but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">you said fluid something fluid</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">personalities or fluid roles or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">flexibility in consciousness yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">it&#39;s cool because you&#39;ll see that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">morphic fields then at the human level</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:06:02.280" style="s2">are constantly being enacted and arising</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:06:05.760" style="s2">and emerging and having a vibrant kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.280" end="00:06:09.539" style="s2">of network yeah that isn&#39;t that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.760" end="00:06:12.330" style="s2">fluid and isn&#39;t just just niches and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.539" end="00:06:14.690" style="s2">boxes that people fit in and then there</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.330" end="00:06:17.910" style="s2">has to be some kind of dialogue between</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.690" end="00:06:20.280" style="s2">belief systems that for the most part in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.910" end="00:06:22.740" style="s2">commenced herbal so so it was an</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.280" end="00:06:23.910" style="s2">interesting way of looking at things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">the other thing I like about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.910" end="00:06:28.890" style="s2">the collective enactment doesn&#39;t can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:31.940" style="s2">between human and human and human and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.890" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">animal a human implant or human and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.940" end="00:06:37.770" style="s2">works of art you know you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:40.420" style="s2">participatory experience with a work of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.770" end="00:06:51.340" style="s2">art and so it becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.420" end="00:06:53.770" style="s2">a myriad display of something culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.340" end="00:07:00.910" style="s2">true or false culture arises out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.770" end="00:07:05.250" style="s2">participatory experience well we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.910" end="00:07:12.850" style="s2">know what we mean by culture and so in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.250" end="00:07:18.520" style="s2">my in my current understanding as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.850" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">composes itself I&#39;ve been doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.520" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">studying on animism you know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:28.770" style="s2">wondering you know where are we from</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:33.210" style="s2">what what were humans born out of and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.770" end="00:07:37.600" style="s2">one of the things that I discovered was</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.210" end="00:07:39.670" style="s2">because early animus mystic societies</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.600" end="00:07:42.490" style="s2">not the one even societies it try little</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.670" end="00:07:45.430" style="s2">you know tribes totemic totemic people</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.490" end="00:07:47.410" style="s2">okay because the anthropologist went and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.430" end="00:07:49.540" style="s2">studied them and they found that totemic</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.410" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">people thought the buffalo were persons</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.540" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">and certain plants with persons and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:59.980" style="s2">certain rocks were persons they they</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:02.550" style="s2">they misunderstood totemic people they</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.980" end="00:08:05.310" style="s2">thought animism everything was</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.550" end="00:08:08.590" style="s2">everything was imbued with</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.310" end="00:08:11.020" style="s2">intersubjective qualities right well it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.590" end="00:08:13.330" style="s2">turns out this is a grave mistake that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.020" end="00:08:15.850" style="s2">that the early totemic cultures were</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.330" end="00:08:18.880" style="s2">actually more exclusionary than us</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.850" end="00:08:21.850" style="s2">because only some plants were persons</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:25.720" style="s2">only some animals were persons and only</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.850" end="00:08:28.150" style="s2">some humans were person oh and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.720" end="00:08:30.070" style="s2">really really interesting so I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.150" end="00:08:33.160" style="s2">this okay if this is one of the times I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.070" end="00:08:36.460" style="s2">talk a lot sure well we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.160" end="00:08:38.710" style="s2">we&#39;re doing yes okay so and this will</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.460" end="00:08:40.690" style="s2">give you some insight into my insight so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.710" end="00:08:43.090" style="s2">this is what I&#39;ve been learning I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.690" end="00:08:45.730" style="s2">unlike third or fourth book and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.090" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">anthropology and animism and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:51.970" style="s2">what&#39;s very interesting so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:54.310" style="s2">imagine early man coming out of his</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.310" end="00:09:00.130" style="s2">animal nature we have what i call</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:03.130" style="s2">incompatible goods you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.130" end="00:09:05.320" style="s2">good the Fox it&#39;s a rabbit so she can go</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.130" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">home and feed her bunnies but it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.320" end="00:09:12.040" style="s2">that the bunny goes home escapes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:14.650" style="s2">goes home to feed her babies so so early</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.040" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">man is just part of this this natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.650" end="00:09:19.960" style="s2">state of incompatible goods and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">self consciousness into him is coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.960" end="00:09:24.370" style="s2">and he understands that he can either</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">take the role of predator or prey and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.370" end="00:09:30.250" style="s2">what you see in these animistic society</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:32.980" style="s2">says society is not a good word these</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.250" end="00:09:36.070" style="s2">animals declans these doe tenant clans</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.980" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">is that they talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">shape-shifting so to be you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:43.529" style="s2">always a predator and you&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">pray it depends upon the enactment and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.529" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">so when the hunters go out to hunt they</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:51.070" style="s2">get into this liminal space because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:52.930" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they&#39;re humans because if</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.070" end="00:09:56.470" style="s2">they get eaten they&#39;re not humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.930" end="00:10:01.150" style="s2">they&#39;re dead already right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.470" end="00:10:03.370" style="s2">get this this this sense that only some</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.150" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">people are humans and it&#39;s your clan and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.370" end="00:10:08.740" style="s2">your totems only some animals are sacred</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:14.140" style="s2">because they&#39;re persons to so you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">never eat them and it&#39;s a constantly a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.140" end="00:10:18.760" style="s2">revolving door so if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">really sick your on your in the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.760" end="00:10:23.290" style="s2">stager you may be dead already and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.400" end="00:10:25.900" style="s2">everything else is either a monster or</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.290" end="00:10:30.040" style="s2">dead or not human including other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.900" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s so exclusionary that if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.040" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">don&#39;t in that the the rules and rights</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:41.050" style="s2">of the tribe you are then considered not</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:44.680" style="s2">a person either right so you can be cast</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.050" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">out and you can&#39;t take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.680" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">so you would die so we start from</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">actually animism which is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:56.650" style="s2">exclusionary more much more an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">exclusionary principle as early man is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.650" end="00:11:01.779" style="s2">trying to understand their you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:05.500" style="s2">starting to understand that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.779" end="00:11:10.030" style="s2">role in between be</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.500" end="00:11:14.050" style="s2">hangs out of this cut and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.030" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">what is established here are rules of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.050" end="00:11:18.820" style="s2">etiquette they&#39;re not etiquette like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.900" end="00:11:21.490" style="s2">have them but they&#39;re around eating so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.820" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">who gets to eat who who gets to be eaten</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:28.660" style="s2">and we see this of course in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">sophisticated rituals like Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:35.320" style="s2">communion you know who gets to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:38.650" style="s2">who gets to be eaten in taboos of all</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.320" end="00:11:41.320" style="s2">sorts and so the religious impulse and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.650" end="00:11:44.340" style="s2">then then young fight late in his life</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.320" end="00:11:49.720" style="s2">talked about the religious impulse being</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.340" end="00:11:51.880" style="s2">this categorization of exclusions so</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.720" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">what is good versus what is bad what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.880" end="00:11:56.380" style="s2">not you know all these normative rules</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">these negative dialectics and out of all</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.380" end="00:12:00.940" style="s2">of that becomes culture right so it gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">more and more sophisticated the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.940" end="00:12:07.030" style="s2">categories get more sophisticated and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:09.100" style="s2">the fundamental confusion about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.030" end="00:12:12.070" style="s2">being a morphic field is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.100" end="00:12:15.460" style="s2">that that it&#39;s basically an exclusionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.070" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">principle over time it&#39;s been expanded</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.460" end="00:12:19.420" style="s2">and this is where you can be proud of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:21.280" style="s2">our modern society we actually include</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.420" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">more now you know so we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.280" end="00:12:29.710" style="s2">dolphins and we&#39;re talking about pets as</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:31.720" style="s2">having rights so so this is this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.710" end="00:12:35.820" style="s2">of interesting because the trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.720" end="00:12:41.770" style="s2">toward more inclusion of personhood and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.820" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">to me that that&#39;s the collective that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.770" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">emergent and it&#39;s not coming through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:56.860" style="s2">culture that that culture the great</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:58.980" style="s2">waves of cultural arisings or emergence</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.860" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">or codifications have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.980" end="00:13:04.089" style="s2">obstructions or obscure anchens or</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">something and this is resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.089" end="00:13:09.520" style="s2">what spiritual traditions have often</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">said you know in or bundle really</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.520" end="00:13:18.530" style="s2">struggled with it and it yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:21.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a radical critique for example of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.530" end="00:13:25.980" style="s2">someone like Tejada shall dad who who</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.510" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">saw that culture and cultural learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.980" end="00:13:32.250" style="s2">was the blossom on evolution and and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:34.220" style="s2">so I would just switch the nuance</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.250" end="00:13:37.320" style="s2">between culture as we know it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.220" end="00:13:41.540" style="s2">collective as actually emergency</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.320" end="00:13:46.110" style="s2">question here to open things up maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.540" end="00:13:49.770" style="s2">so we have a cultural value now of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.110" end="00:13:55.560" style="s2">inclusion of including persons more and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.770" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">more is that is a cultural principle of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.560" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">inclusion the same as um you said what</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.810" style="s2">was the word usage he&#39;s had a community</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">collective collective yeah yeah purchase</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.810" end="00:14:18.390" style="s2">participatory collective pc right what</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.380" end="00:14:20.850" style="s2">um well I uh I&#39;ve been intuition on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.390" end="00:14:23.610" style="s2">but I want to see where you go yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:26.700" style="s2">so we&#39;re kind of making distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:29.640" style="s2">that haven&#39;t been made before and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.700" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">agreeing to say culture is something and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:36.200" style="s2">that is the exclusionary impulse and of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">course all these these systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.200" end="00:14:41.880" style="s2">self-maintaining self liberate right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:43.770" style="s2">so as the process becomes more toward</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.880" end="00:14:46.830" style="s2">participatory collective they become</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.770" end="00:14:48.660" style="s2">trans cultural movements and they self</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.830" end="00:14:52.380" style="s2">liberate so then i would say at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.660" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">certain point yeah so so in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.380" end="00:14:57.090" style="s2">transitional phase is it is it the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:14:58.920" style="s2">language of culture of the language not</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.090" end="00:15:01.260" style="s2">of culture and and I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.920" end="00:15:03.000" style="s2">make a distant want it to be a false</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.260" end="00:15:04.500" style="s2">distinction I want it to be a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.000" end="00:15:08.940" style="s2">distinction you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.500" end="00:15:16.610" style="s2">want it to be imposed on what&#39;s real but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.940" end="00:15:20.670" style="s2">it perhaps can be a perspective that um</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.610" end="00:15:24.150" style="s2">creates you know some my new years my</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.670" end="00:15:26.030" style="s2">here&#39;s my sort of hit and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.150" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">yeah your word so far is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.030" end="00:15:31.790" style="s2">participatory collective and / to end</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:35.370" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.790" end="00:15:39.750" style="s2">which is naturally inclusive nationally</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.370" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">inclusive happens in any culture between</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.750" end="00:15:44.430" style="s2">cultures and and all and has happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:47.959" style="s2">and can&#39;t happen in all times because</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.430" end="00:15:50.699" style="s2">it&#39;s just about what happens between us</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.959" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">no matter who the US is or how many of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.699" end="00:15:57.720" style="s2">us there are when we get together and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:16:02.610" style="s2">racked and participate so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.720" end="00:16:05.430" style="s2">much about the the principles or Ted</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.610" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">booths or rules or understandings or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.430" end="00:16:12.600" style="s2">beliefs with which we operate amongst</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.110" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2">ourselves or behave or exclude one</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.600" end="00:16:17.339" style="s2">another so I was thinking even if even</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:20.339" style="s2">if a cultural value becomes one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.339" end="00:16:25.470" style="s2">inclusion a principle of inclusion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.339" end="00:16:28.259" style="s2">still operating a bit on a principle of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.470" end="00:16:30.829" style="s2">exclusion which is that our value is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.259" end="00:16:35.009" style="s2">include as much as possible rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.829" end="00:16:39.959" style="s2">to exclude which either other people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.009" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">doing or we did in the past yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.959" end="00:16:45.389" style="s2">operand operating on a principle in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:48.569" style="s2">way is still not the same as what</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.389" end="00:16:51.959" style="s2">happens when you simply when you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.569" end="00:16:53.550" style="s2">when you engage with people and you part</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.959" end="00:16:58.050" style="s2">it and you participate with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.550" end="00:17:00.509" style="s2">everybody can participate well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.050" end="00:17:02.759" style="s2">what was slowed down so I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.509" end="00:17:04.919" style="s2">so for the purposes of discussion i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.759" end="00:17:07.829" style="s2">going to be an advocate for my new idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.919" end="00:17:10.589" style="s2">ok great so we can suss out whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.829" end="00:17:12.780" style="s2">robust or something and instead of me</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.589" end="00:17:16.709" style="s2">trying to beat up on myself with all my</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:18.809" style="s2">own distinctions so I would say that not</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.709" end="00:17:23.640" style="s2">everybody I would say from this new</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.809" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">position that um it was inconceivable</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.640" end="00:17:30.919" style="s2">for early man to participate you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I mean you couldn&#39;t go out and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.919" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">when they you know especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">read these books it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">river people ate pineapples they smell</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.700" end="00:17:43.230" style="s2">the pineapples they were monsters so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.230" end="00:17:49.230" style="s2">clan it you just wouldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:53.820" style="s2">get post formal as an early man and go</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.230" end="00:17:56.150" style="s2">out and hang out with a river dweller it</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.820" end="00:18:00.600" style="s2">turn it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.150" end="00:18:02.490" style="s2">exclusionary even the mind was excluded</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.600" end="00:18:04.410" style="s2">from those kinds of ideas right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.490" end="00:18:07.169" style="s2">talking about a radical shift here okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.410" end="00:18:09.179" style="s2">and so yes they were just objects and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.169" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t be anything else yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.179" end="00:18:12.809" style="s2">this one guy&#39;s trying to write about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.059" style="s2">so he calls them sometimes monsters that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.809" end="00:18:18.740" style="s2">or sometimes they&#39;re just dead or their</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.059" end="00:18:20.549" style="s2">objects or their monsters like</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.740" end="00:18:21.929" style="s2">transitional forms but they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.549" end="00:18:23.340" style="s2">scary things you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.929" end="00:18:26.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not yeah you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.340" end="00:18:30.299" style="s2">participate they have to be exercised</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.150" end="00:18:32.580" style="s2">exercised or something so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.299" end="00:18:34.710" style="s2">you can make a statement like you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.580" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">did to me shows that the something</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.710" end="00:18:42.350" style="s2">really novel has happened right so and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">we know that there&#39;s ranges of that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:48.540" style="s2">the status of personhood that slaves had</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:50.309" style="s2">in different cultures sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.540" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">were almost like people and they happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.309" end="00:18:53.640" style="s2">to be caught up in a slave economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:58.620" style="s2">sometimes they weren&#39;t really they</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.640" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">weren&#39;t people you know and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.620" end="00:19:06.450" style="s2">we can think of the future where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.210" end="00:19:08.250" style="s2">a true participation with with what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.450" end="00:19:12.270" style="s2">think has objects it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.250" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">interesting you know and at scales that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.270" end="00:19:19.710" style="s2">are both what we consider self subhuman</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:22.470" style="s2">like like a donkey or superhuman like</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.710" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">the planet or Gaia or something we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.470" end="00:19:28.169" style="s2">know this is that part is just truly</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:30.410" style="s2">imaginary but then I think your your</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.169" end="00:19:33.990" style="s2">statement about principles a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.410" end="00:19:36.179" style="s2">principle-based inclusion is still</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.990" end="00:19:38.429" style="s2">exclusionary so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.179" end="00:19:39.809" style="s2">principle-based because every time you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.429" end="00:19:42.919" style="s2">make a principle there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.809" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">what&#39;s not what doesn&#39;t fit this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:50.820" style="s2">participatory based and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">interesting is that it it it captures</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.820" end="00:19:54.900" style="s2">something of a flavor of animism because</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">in animism even though it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.900" end="00:19:59.430" style="s2">exclusionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:01.680" style="s2">to be a person you had to enact</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.430" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">personhood you couldn&#39;t go and hang out</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">at the river and eat pineapples so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:09.390" style="s2">takes that part it makes it less</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:12.590" style="s2">principle and conceptual based when it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.390" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">moves it into an inclusionary framework</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.590" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">without the meaning inclusion as being</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:20.460" style="s2">principal day so that I think is that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.640" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">a good point that serves my argument why</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.460" end="00:20:30.920" style="s2">I said thank you for making it yeah i am</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">here sir um i was i was thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.920" end="00:20:39.450" style="s2">when you were talking about the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.240" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">of of a future where we can participate</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.450" end="00:20:45.030" style="s2">with objects you know things that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">consider objects now I was thinking oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.030" end="00:20:51.510" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:55.140" style="s2">like anything if I want to I can engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.510" end="00:20:56.910" style="s2">with it as a thing over there that I is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.140" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">basically a subtle dismissal or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.910" end="00:21:06.030" style="s2">disregard it&#39;s like a firm wall or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:08.520" style="s2">something but even even like the wall I</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.030" end="00:21:11.550" style="s2">can turn to it and I can open in an</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.520" end="00:21:14.270" style="s2">inner subjective way I can actually open</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.550" end="00:21:17.700" style="s2">to it and see what it will teach me I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.270" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">did this with like I was doing some</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.700" end="00:21:22.730" style="s2">elemental meditations one day and I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:25.920" style="s2">SAT by the water and I open to it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.730" end="00:21:29.040" style="s2">you know dialogue you know but like</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.920" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">subtle to see what it what was for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.040" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">and taught me yeah and um yeah it seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:37.380" style="s2">like there&#39;s actually limit to that but</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:40.050" style="s2">it is a prize if you&#39;re saying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.380" end="00:21:43.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s something that is a party</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.050" end="00:21:46.980" style="s2">it&#39;s an enactment that&#39;s awesome because</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.400" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2">because I I do this generative self</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.980" end="00:21:51.090" style="s2">course right and then you go through</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:53.990" style="s2">levels of shadow and shadow volt is</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.090" end="00:21:57.630" style="s2">always that part that excludes right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.990" end="00:21:59.790" style="s2">beneath the cultural level there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.630" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">archetype in an animal level and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.790" end="00:22:05.070" style="s2">there&#39;s elemental level and so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:08.070" style="s2">actually never heard heard anyone say</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.070" end="00:22:10.530" style="s2">that they did it elemental contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.070" end="00:22:12.540" style="s2">or elemental meditation but but I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.530" end="00:22:16.290" style="s2">the Zen Buddhists do this you know they</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.540" end="00:22:20.490" style="s2">I mean the traditional very archaic old</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.290" end="00:22:22.860" style="s2">tradition of they meditate in front of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.490" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">rotting corpses so they can be quantum</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.860" end="00:22:27.780" style="s2">asst between form and life and death</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:30.110" style="s2">form and formlessness elementals all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.780" end="00:22:33.740" style="s2">way down and and these are very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.110" end="00:22:37.290" style="s2">profound what I call you know deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.740" end="00:22:39.870" style="s2">phenomenology shadow practice so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.290" end="00:22:41.940" style="s2">really cool because because that and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.870" end="00:22:45.860" style="s2">course opening up to something that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.940" end="00:22:49.680" style="s2">object is got that feeling of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.860" end="00:22:51.270" style="s2">participating somehow you know and one</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.680" end="00:22:53.940" style="s2">of the one of the things that I find</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.270" end="00:22:57.870" style="s2">helpful but it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.940" end="00:22:59.730" style="s2">necessary is instead of calling it into</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.870" end="00:23:03.030" style="s2">subjectivity instead of using what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.730" end="00:23:06.900" style="s2">subject and what&#39;s object we work with</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.030" end="00:23:09.720" style="s2">this notion of agency okay so if i look</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.900" end="00:23:11.700" style="s2">at the wall it has a lot of agency i</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.720" end="00:23:14.040" style="s2">mean i know it has a lot of agency</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.700" end="00:23:17.910" style="s2">because if i run into it isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.040" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">move you know I mean agencies is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.910" end="00:23:25.590" style="s2">kind of solidity is it is an agency you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:28.980" style="s2">know and the other thing I like the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.590" end="00:23:32.130" style="s2">I like to talk about agency is like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.980" end="00:23:34.740" style="s2">great migrations and the sarin when the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.130" end="00:23:38.550" style="s2">Serengeti plains flood Neil that great</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.740" end="00:23:41.220" style="s2">wildebeest and elephant and hippopotamus</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.550" end="00:23:44.370" style="s2">migrations right so we see the animals</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.220" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">of it having agency but you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.370" end="00:23:51.180" style="s2">actually see that the water has so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:54.270" style="s2">agency the hue that it draws enormous</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.180" end="00:23:57.630" style="s2">numbers of animals so once you start</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.270" end="00:24:00.830" style="s2">playing with and and so for me this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.630" end="00:24:03.390" style="s2">neo animism and that is not that things</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.830" end="00:24:06.650" style="s2">you know not only is concept of making</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.390" end="00:24:09.900" style="s2">persons but to see that everything has</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.650" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">agency and and sometimes the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.900" end="00:24:15.810" style="s2">we think has the least agency like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:19.050" style="s2">know physical objects in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.810" end="00:24:23.879" style="s2">like weather actually have the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.050" end="00:24:25.829" style="s2">agency and and and that discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.879" end="00:24:30.479" style="s2">really fastening and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.829" end="00:24:33.259" style="s2">truly participatory hmm well I know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.479" end="00:24:37.229" style="s2">it&#39;s still confusing to me whether the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.259" end="00:24:39.239" style="s2">the wall the wall is a good example cuz</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.229" end="00:24:42.179" style="s2">it feels dead it&#39;s not like the water</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.239" end="00:24:45.169" style="s2">like elements actually feel alive in</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.179" end="00:24:47.579" style="s2">some way but the wall feels dead and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.169" end="00:24:50.639" style="s2">we&#39;re never alive something like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.579" end="00:24:53.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s not clear to me that it has its</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.639" end="00:24:56.039" style="s2">own subjectivity or something yes I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.489" end="00:24:58.859" style="s2">don&#39;t know where the communication or</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.039" end="00:25:00.539" style="s2">the relationship or the teaching us from</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.859" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s receiving</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.539" end="00:25:06.209" style="s2">anything from me but I can still I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:08.849" style="s2">still participate in the same way I</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.209" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">participate with you I can still do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.849" end="00:25:14.459" style="s2">same energetic I like the word an</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:18.569" style="s2">enactment yeah I can take I can enter</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.459" end="00:25:22.409" style="s2">the same energetic stance temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.569" end="00:25:24.149" style="s2">that I would with anyone if I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.409" end="00:25:27.229" style="s2">more present with them and open to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.149" end="00:25:29.690" style="s2">more fully I can do that with anything I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.229" end="00:25:34.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it does to that thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.690" end="00:25:37.169" style="s2">yeah you know what it does to me well</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.289" end="00:25:39.299" style="s2">you know I think the wall Wilbur would</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.169" end="00:25:44.849" style="s2">say it&#39;s a it&#39;s a heap it&#39;s not a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.299" end="00:25:47.219" style="s2">lot so you know we can I&#39;m and these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.849" end="00:25:51.479" style="s2">just techniques to describe our</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.219" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">relationship so you could say you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.479" end="00:25:55.589" style="s2">don&#39;t have relationship with the wall</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:57.959" style="s2">but but I know that my cells are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.589" end="00:26:00.329" style="s2">exchanging electrons and photons with</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.959" end="00:26:04.259" style="s2">the atoms in the wall but I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.329" end="00:26:08.999" style="s2">that the wall has has agency in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.259" end="00:26:11.339" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s in relation to its in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.999" end="00:26:13.769" style="s2">structural relationship to gravity for</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.339" end="00:26:17.579" style="s2">example which is why it stands as a wall</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.769" end="00:26:20.119" style="s2">and so actually gravity has agency so</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.579" end="00:26:24.690" style="s2">you know these are just these are just</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.119" end="00:26:28.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not important distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.690" end="00:26:31.199" style="s2">they&#39;re just different ways of how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.440" end="00:26:33.479" style="s2">can describe the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.199" end="00:26:35.509" style="s2">participation with something like a wall</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.479" end="00:26:35.509" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.490" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">if it if it was a wall like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.170" end="00:26:46.390" style="s2">Vietnam Memorial it would have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">different sort of participation and how</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.390" end="00:26:54.940" style="s2">you talk about that is just yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:27:00.580" style="s2">feels like there&#39;s a lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.940" end="00:27:04.150" style="s2">there what it feels exciting in the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.580" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">way that a lot of the inner subjective</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.150" end="00:27:10.150" style="s2">practice groups feel exciting I like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:12.250" style="s2">pointing out that we can consciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:18.450" style="s2">participate together and and see what</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.250" end="00:27:21.460" style="s2">happens like a new like a new tool a new</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.450" end="00:27:26.860" style="s2">organ to develop much more fully than we</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.460" end="00:27:29.370" style="s2">have as yet so let&#39;s come back to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.860" end="00:27:36.160" style="s2">you were talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.370" end="00:27:38.260" style="s2">participatory cut it yeah is there more</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.160" end="00:27:41.050" style="s2">is it our direction that we were going</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.260" end="00:27:44.410" style="s2">because I have another question but no</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.050" end="00:27:47.020" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty much wrapped up with that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.410" end="00:27:50.200" style="s2">all right so so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.020" end="00:27:52.840" style="s2">going there because I like participatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.200" end="00:27:59.610" style="s2">collective it feels more exciting to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.840" end="00:28:02.410" style="s2">then cold then culture feels beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.610" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">enjoyable full of value as we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.410" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">talking about it like to exclude things</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:12.040" style="s2">is to create oneself so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.490" end="00:28:16.620" style="s2">beauty that gets created lots of insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:16.620" style="s2">that one has by excluding other things</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.679" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">but participatory collectives as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">talking about them feel like they have</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:33.700" style="s2">more potential to sort of meet us in our</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:36.700" style="s2">personhood and also treat to treat</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.700" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">ourselves as persons even more fully and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.700" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">also to help us go where we all want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:48.760" style="s2">go as as people on the planet um so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:52.600" style="s2">wondering now and I think distinction</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.760" end="00:28:54.280" style="s2">between principles of inclusion still</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.600" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">being culture and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.280" end="00:28:57.550" style="s2">collective still being something else</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:29:00.870" style="s2">than that I think that worthwhile for</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.550" end="00:29:03.460" style="s2">now so now I&#39;m wondering what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.870" end="00:29:06.310" style="s2">we keep engaging in participatory</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.460" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">collectives does culture come out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.310" end="00:29:11.110" style="s2">that does it never come out of that or</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:14.230" style="s2">you know I have lots of friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.110" end="00:29:17.140" style="s2">in two different things different you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.230" end="00:29:18.670" style="s2">know kind of like leading edge things</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.140" end="00:29:21.430" style="s2">and it feels like lots of people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.670" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">trying to create a new culture trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.430" end="00:29:26.010" style="s2">create a like a Western or American</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:31.810" style="s2">culture or something that has some depth</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.010" end="00:29:33.640" style="s2">some depth to it and so you know what so</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.810" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">there&#39;s just a question of what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">relationship is between these two things</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:44.110" style="s2">I mean in a way especially in when in</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:45.790" style="s2">the collective participation groups that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.110" end="00:29:47.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m thinking of the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.790" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">groups for example there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.500" end="00:29:52.420" style="s2">emphasis on what&#39;s new and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:54.910" style="s2">unknown what&#39;s coming next and when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.420" end="00:29:56.380" style="s2">engage in that sort of relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.910" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">the present moment and into my</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.380" end="00:30:03.000" style="s2">interactions with people it actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.540" end="00:30:08.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like like there&#39;s much that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.000" end="00:30:10.780" style="s2">gets deeply established or rooted in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.590" end="00:30:12.610" style="s2">way that like culture or history feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.780" end="00:30:15.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s deeply established and rooted</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.610" end="00:30:16.870" style="s2">because it feels more like like Terry</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.400" end="00:30:20.530" style="s2">cotton weave saying it&#39;s like a practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.870" end="00:30:25.330" style="s2">and so what gets established is a praxis</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.530" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">but what&#39;s happening between us is novel</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.330" end="00:30:31.300" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if that what that leads</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:35.160" style="s2">to in terms if you do it long term with</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.300" end="00:30:40.870" style="s2">a group of people you know repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.160" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">whatever that creates culture yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.870" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">mean I&#39;m arguing that culture originally</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.740" end="00:30:52.420" style="s2">comes out of this exclusionary has this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:56.440" style="s2">exclusionary aspect to it and is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.420" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">maintained by ritualized participation</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.440" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">right that that that there&#39;s don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.620" style="s2">really want to use participatory</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:05.800" style="s2">collective because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.620" end="00:31:07.690" style="s2">such a modern way to think of first you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.800" end="00:31:11.050" style="s2">have to be an individual to think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.690" end="00:31:14.680" style="s2">participatory collective and that early</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.050" end="00:31:16.950" style="s2">man was less individuated at all that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.680" end="00:31:26.290" style="s2">that&#39;s even ma you know another modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.950" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">phase but I think part of this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.290" end="00:31:29.500" style="s2">of like what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:30.760" style="s2">personality I mean your uniqueness is</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.500" end="00:31:34.600" style="s2">going to come up and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.760" end="00:31:36.520" style="s2">have a default pattern especially if</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.600" end="00:31:41.710" style="s2">you&#39;re not experimental about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.520" end="00:31:44.440" style="s2">or not a theater person and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.710" end="00:31:46.570" style="s2">as long as we don&#39;t ratify it you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.440" end="00:31:48.610" style="s2">so you take a snapshot of it I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.570" end="00:31:50.920" style="s2">is of course one of one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.610" end="00:31:53.350" style="s2">do all the time you know you have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.920" end="00:31:55.540" style="s2">thanksgiving and then you want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.350" end="00:31:57.610" style="s2">the same way next year and you do it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.540" end="00:31:59.890" style="s2">same way next year and it was nice but</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.610" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">then at a certain point the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.890" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s always the same actually becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.870" end="00:32:11.230" style="s2">burden and and and so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.380" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">that mixture of when is something kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.230" end="00:32:18.220" style="s2">of falsely rarified and when is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:21.640" style="s2">something just kind of and re-enacted in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.220" end="00:32:24.910" style="s2">a participatory way and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.640" end="00:32:29.559" style="s2">true for the ego and the personality you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.910" end="00:32:31.210" style="s2">know to have a stable way if that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.559" end="00:32:34.330" style="s2">show up in the world is not a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.210" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">but if it&#39;s falsely rarefied so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.330" end="00:32:39.610" style="s2">you&#39;re actually putting an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">show up that way when it&#39;s a disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.610" end="00:32:44.530" style="s2">with what you actually feel or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.650" end="00:32:47.920" style="s2">then then there&#39;s a problem so i would</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.530" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">say in many aspects today a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.920" end="00:32:54.460" style="s2">is culture is falsely rarefied and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:56.980" style="s2">intercourse it&#39;s all you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.460" end="00:33:01.140" style="s2">that that&#39;s where people actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.980" end="00:33:01.140" style="s2">working on their cultures right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.550" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">fundamentalism is the opposite move</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.340" end="00:33:13.929" style="s2">fundamentalism is the move to go back</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:16.780" style="s2">and more strongly reify the symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.929" end="00:33:21.800" style="s2">systems that are not actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.780" end="00:33:24.440" style="s2">enacted in a participatory way a young</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.800" end="00:33:27.980" style="s2">child you know a young child in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.440" end="00:33:31.730" style="s2">modern world on the internet who is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.980" end="00:33:35.270" style="s2">you know being forced to marry an 80</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.730" end="00:33:40.550" style="s2">year old cousin is probably not enacting</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.270" end="00:33:42.680" style="s2">the culture in a participatory way so</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.550" end="00:33:46.550" style="s2">leads can lead to false false</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.680" end="00:33:48.820" style="s2">consciousness even though there could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.550" end="00:33:54.050" style="s2">a lot of group cohesion but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.820" end="00:33:57.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know things a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.050" end="00:33:59.300" style="s2">individual need a lot of things have</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.890" end="00:34:01.720" style="s2">changed so now it&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.300" end="00:34:01.720" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:30.310" style="s2">ok here&#39;s another distinction to make um</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.740" end="00:34:33.399" style="s2">culture as um as as behavior and rules</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.310" end="00:34:36.070" style="s2">that come from exclusionary yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.399" end="00:34:39.460" style="s2">exclusions I&#39;m different kind I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.070" end="00:34:44.409" style="s2">yeah excuse me our principles um the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.460" end="00:34:47.909" style="s2">praxis of opening in participation with</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.409" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">someone or something and then that gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.909" end="00:34:54.669" style="s2">mixed of what a thing or a person is and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">then but what about just what happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.669" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">between two energy fields like weather</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:04.450" style="s2">eye open to you or not we&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:06.339" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to do a practice for us to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.450" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">be participating together I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.339" end="00:35:17.099" style="s2">to do a practice to be affected by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">walls and the floor and that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.099" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">even more inclusive because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:26.859" style="s2">instant innate it&#39;s just the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:29.410" style="s2">being affected by one another yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.859" end="00:35:32.440" style="s2">now we have to you know at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.410" end="00:35:34.540" style="s2">level everything is always participating</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.440" end="00:35:43.050" style="s2">with everything else there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.540" end="00:35:46.210" style="s2">no exclusion and that realization makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.050" end="00:35:49.450" style="s2">participatory collective participation</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.210" end="00:35:52.030" style="s2">easy because everything&#39;s just always so</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.450" end="00:35:53.980" style="s2">so you know I could play the devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.030" end="00:35:55.810" style="s2">advocate I don&#39;t really believe this but</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.980" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">you know since we&#39;re playing around with</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.810" end="00:35:59.319" style="s2">these definitions I could play the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:03.160" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate and say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.319" end="00:36:07.089" style="s2">precisely why all cultures are merely</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:08.859" style="s2">exclusionary efforts because you take</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.089" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">away the exclusionary effort and all you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.859" end="00:36:13.420" style="s2">have is participation so I could say</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:17.640" style="s2">that what we&#39;re always doing is calling</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.420" end="00:36:17.640" style="s2">from the sum total or participation</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.660" end="00:36:22.930" style="s2">transformational identities which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.859" end="00:36:24.829" style="s2">cool as long as you don&#39;t verify them so</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.930" end="00:36:28.269" style="s2">from that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.829" end="00:36:37.009" style="s2">could actually make a stronger argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.269" end="00:36:38.749" style="s2">against these summits of identity I like</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.009" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">it because I actually like adding that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.749" end="00:36:46.099" style="s2">the third tier because it it instead of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.180" end="00:36:48.069" style="s2">making it polar what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.099" end="00:36:53.329" style="s2">it makes it more of a spectrum yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.069" end="00:36:56.690" style="s2">because even the even in that middle way</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.329" end="00:36:58.249" style="s2">of the Praxis of being participatory</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.690" end="00:36:59.539" style="s2">with someone else like you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.249" end="00:37:02.180" style="s2">about Thanksgiving dinner or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.539" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">like that we have to pick up we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.180" end="00:37:08.839" style="s2">use every behavior is a canary it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:11.059" style="s2">behavior not that behavior when you bite</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.839" end="00:37:16.150" style="s2">people you don&#39;t invite other people</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.059" end="00:37:18.789" style="s2">right so like we have to use culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.150" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">while we&#39;re being open to one another</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.789" end="00:37:24.559" style="s2">yeah and you separated you know they</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:27.079" style="s2">can&#39;t be totally separated yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.559" end="00:37:33.589" style="s2">key is the way we see it today is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.079" end="00:37:39.559" style="s2">have that be a viable fluid um semi</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.589" end="00:37:42.529" style="s2">permeable membrane not a bounded prison</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.559" end="00:37:44.239" style="s2">you know not not like if you go down the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.529" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">river and eat pineapples you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.239" end="00:37:49.309" style="s2">human you know so that&#39;s a little friend</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:52.069" style="s2">for all times you know except it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.309" end="00:37:54.469" style="s2">last for all times because these these</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.069" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">structures self liberate and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.469" end="00:38:05.180" style="s2">because its peak seems to be a universal</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.190" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">law or something but yeah so in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.180" end="00:38:13.309" style="s2">sense it&#39;s a both and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">make a universal principle out of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.309" end="00:38:19.219" style="s2">insight I just it&#39;s to me an insight the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.289" style="s2">purpose of an insight is nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.219" end="00:38:26.690" style="s2">clutch onto as universal waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.289" end="00:38:29.049" style="s2">another insight is to is to make what</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.690" end="00:38:34.969" style="s2">was either nuisance or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.049" end="00:38:38.080" style="s2">solid thing more alive has more life in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.969" end="00:38:40.120" style="s2">it you know I like it the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.080" end="00:38:45.300" style="s2">insight is to make something that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.120" end="00:38:53.080" style="s2">solid have more aliveness in it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.300" end="00:38:55.770" style="s2">like it too yeah and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.080" end="00:38:58.270" style="s2">happens is this is why some of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.770" end="00:39:01.450" style="s2">spiritual technologies are both</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.270" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">fantastic and problematic because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.450" end="00:39:07.140" style="s2">do that they make something that was</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.250" end="00:39:10.870" style="s2">solid have more life and then people</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.140" end="00:39:14.050" style="s2">make that into a solid thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.870" end="00:39:17.320" style="s2">and this is this is the move that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.050" end="00:39:37.270" style="s2">that is counter punctual to actual</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.320" end="00:39:40.030" style="s2">insight you know Rick said some</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.270" end="00:39:41.830" style="s2">important things today already so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.030" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">think we&#39;ve said important things and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.830" end="00:39:48.430" style="s2">let me let me we could forget them okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">whistles older don&#39;t forget that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.430" end="00:39:52.270" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s gonna remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:53.860" style="s2">everything is the Akashic record you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.270" end="00:39:55.330" style="s2">know that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.860" end="00:39:57.700" style="s2">remember everything we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.330" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2">forgetting well and the organism somehow</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.700" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">always remember is still fun Oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.060" end="00:40:16.180" style="s2">interesting I think um okay let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:19.600" style="s2">don&#39;t quiet see anything wants to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.180" end="00:40:24.250" style="s2">participate Oh we&#39;ll have to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.600" end="00:40:26.650" style="s2">exclusions okay I want to go further</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.250" end="00:40:30.520" style="s2">okay okay this leads in important</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.650" end="00:40:35.010" style="s2">directions that I often go okay two</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.520" end="00:40:35.010" style="s2">things one</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.320" end="00:40:41.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a bullet head if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.790" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">bullet which I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.460" end="00:40:45.840" style="s2">bulleted that&#39;s to drop no that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:50.370" style="s2">yeah just that&#39;s fine continue we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.840" end="00:40:52.440" style="s2">like a landscaper exploring here um okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.370" end="00:40:55.620" style="s2">here&#39;s one thing when everything becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.440" end="00:40:59.340" style="s2">um we&#39;ve talked about this before but</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.620" end="00:41:03.590" style="s2">the movement we just made and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.340" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">pointing out of what insight is for is</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.590" end="00:41:08.940" style="s2">something that I end up coming back to a</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:14.370" style="s2">lot I think and it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:17.940" style="s2">the when everything everything from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.370" end="00:41:22.730" style="s2">deepest you know fundamental insights to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.940" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">the most concrete personal requirements</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.730" end="00:41:27.630" style="s2">becomes relation alized and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:30.120" style="s2">everything is relation alized there</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.630" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">seems with the next step always seems to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.120" end="00:41:37.220" style="s2">me is deep pragmatism like what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:42.510" style="s2">anything for in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.220" end="00:41:46.950" style="s2">everything else and is that where I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.510" end="00:41:49.980" style="s2">to go and I see that deep pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.950" end="00:41:52.140" style="s2">opening up in spirituality more and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.980" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">I see it opening up in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.140" end="00:42:00.150" style="s2">culture more and more in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:03.080" style="s2">disciplines in relationship to education</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.150" end="00:42:06.060" style="s2">health there&#39;s like this deep question</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.080" end="00:42:08.940" style="s2">we have access to lots of stuff what are</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.060" end="00:42:13.110" style="s2">they for where do we want to go and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.940" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">end of refocusing on value values so</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.110" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">that&#39;s one one direction or another</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">direction is that somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.560" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2">somehow saying somehow that pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.750" end="00:42:39.240" style="s2">often comes to me with a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:42.990" style="s2">tragedy like everything gets relation</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.240" end="00:42:46.500" style="s2">alized and then so it loses its own it</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.990" end="00:42:49.230" style="s2">loses its independence it loses its</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.500" end="00:42:51.510" style="s2">independent meaning and even purpose</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.230" end="00:42:54.930" style="s2">like where we want to go together is</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.510" end="00:42:58.170" style="s2">relation alized in this in this space so</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.930" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">it too is only it&#39;s like I&#39;m shading</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.170" end="00:43:02.120" style="s2">towards knee ilysm I can feel it but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:04.980" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know how to get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.120" end="00:43:07.620" style="s2">but just like today and yesterday that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.980" end="00:43:09.770" style="s2">tragedy is sort of like switched into</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.620" end="00:43:15.270" style="s2">humor why I started laughing because</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.770" end="00:43:17.640" style="s2">everything is it&#39;s just it&#39;s just funny</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.270" end="00:43:20.420" style="s2">it&#39;s just like there&#39;s no you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.640" end="00:43:23.730" style="s2">can&#39;t land anywhere and it&#39;s just funny</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.420" end="00:43:25.290" style="s2">it&#39;s rigged I still feel regret it I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.730" end="00:43:27.690" style="s2">still feel like it&#39;s regrettable that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.290" end="00:43:30.050" style="s2">everything becomes utilitarian eyes Dan</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.690" end="00:43:32.370" style="s2">and becomes pragmatic in this way it</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.050" end="00:43:36.870" style="s2">again there&#39;s still there&#39;s these shades</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.370" end="00:43:39.840" style="s2">of need ilysm in there um but I recycle</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.870" end="00:43:41.610" style="s2">through this what we&#39;ve just done here I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.840" end="00:43:46.080" style="s2">recycle through this a lot i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.610" end="00:43:52.610" style="s2">what comes next and where yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.080" end="00:43:52.610" style="s2">comes next basically um</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:44:07.500" style="s2">yes so so i think that the situation</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.110" end="00:44:10.650" style="s2">obviously becomes more exasperated the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.500" end="00:44:17.010" style="s2">more significant the insight right so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.650" end="00:44:20.190" style="s2">you have a significant insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.010" end="00:44:25.800" style="s2">nature of reality or the emptiness of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.190" end="00:44:32.900" style="s2">self something like that and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.800" end="00:44:32.900" style="s2">overwhelms right it overwhelms and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:44.610" style="s2">there can be what I would call and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:46.320" style="s2">not saying this is what you said because</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.610" end="00:44:48.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll just start talking and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.320" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2">in some where here is what you said or</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">more more idea of what we&#39;re saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:56.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying this is what you said but</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:45:01.610" style="s2">so you have these significant insights</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.490" end="00:45:04.380" style="s2">and then there can be this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.610" end="00:45:07.320" style="s2">frameshift so either I&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.380" end="00:45:12.030" style="s2">significant insight frame or I&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.320" end="00:45:16.050" style="s2">ordinary frame and they don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.030" end="00:45:19.530" style="s2">really have that it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.050" end="00:45:22.740" style="s2">their intention they&#39;re just in this too</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.530" end="00:45:25.500" style="s2">much of an either/or kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.740" end="00:45:28.500" style="s2">that feels comfortable so I either</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.500" end="00:45:32.490" style="s2">relativize the significant insight add</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:34.080" style="s2">something practical or I&#39;m in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.490" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">nihilism and say everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.080" end="00:45:39.030" style="s2">practical is so relativized by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">significant insight it doesn&#39;t may have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.030" end="00:45:46.170" style="s2">any meaning anymore so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:48.660" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ve experienced is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.170" end="00:45:52.620" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s just frameshifting</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.660" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">rather than it&#39;s like you need an</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.620" end="00:45:57.600" style="s2">insight on these these two things now</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:00.390" style="s2">you know and then that of course can</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.600" end="00:46:05.370" style="s2">come with the same problem so that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.390" end="00:46:08.310" style="s2">I can see would tend and then it could</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.370" end="00:46:12.600" style="s2">be funny because what&#39;s funny is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.310" end="00:46:14.580" style="s2">that they&#39;re like jokes of each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.600" end="00:46:17.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like that thing I always</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.580" end="00:46:20.850" style="s2">say how much does the scale way you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.010" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">that question is is a relational joke so</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.850" end="00:46:29.610" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know how to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:32.970" style="s2">question but what came up for me was</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.610" end="00:46:38.580" style="s2">this concept of this notion of effort</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.970" end="00:46:41.820" style="s2">you know this is a very richly nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.580" end="00:46:46.230" style="s2">word in taoism effortless effort and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.820" end="00:46:48.090" style="s2">think that that the nihilism comes into</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.230" end="00:46:51.870" style="s2">play when you think you have to add</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.090" end="00:47:00.630" style="s2">effort to make the insight practical and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.870" end="00:47:04.760" style="s2">and I don&#39;t even know how to game up in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.630" end="00:47:04.760" style="s2">me but that&#39;s the that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.349" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">it changes your world it changes your</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:22.999" style="s2">behavior and that alone is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">pragmatic even though we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.999" end="00:47:26.989" style="s2">necessarily know so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:32.119" style="s2">instrumentalized we didn&#39;t put it in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.989" end="00:47:34.670" style="s2">intrumental package but it&#39;s it&#39;s shaped</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.119" end="00:47:39.729" style="s2">something and that so to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.670" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">a pragmatic thing even though we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.729" end="00:47:53.170" style="s2">necessarily know how to name it or</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:53.170" style="s2">create meaning from it so the ordination</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.289" end="00:48:00.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the ordinary ships but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.630" end="00:48:02.749" style="s2">ordinary is now headed in a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.349" end="00:48:06.069" style="s2">direction than it would have otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.749" end="00:48:12.549" style="s2">been even though it just feels just as</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.069" end="00:48:15.890" style="s2">ordinary and relative as it did before</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.549" end="00:48:17.660" style="s2">so that would be a little story that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.890" end="00:48:19.450" style="s2">would tell and it&#39;s not really an</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.660" end="00:48:30.890" style="s2">explanation because it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.450" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">fit but yeah but but my sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.890" end="00:48:38.380" style="s2">that that places this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:43.430" style="s2">framesets which without really yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.380" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">mm-hmm mm-hmm I mean in a way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.430" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">parallel</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.319" end="00:48:53.640" style="s2">I have to say don&#39;t have the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.809" end="00:48:55.799" style="s2">anymore so it&#39;s some well that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.640" end="00:48:58.499" style="s2">yeah my anguish is that it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.799" end="00:49:02.609" style="s2">non necessary problem but I can&#39;t cite</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.499" end="00:49:06.619" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t moved through it yet you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.609" end="00:49:09.619" style="s2">know I have not moved through it yet um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.619" end="00:49:12.089" style="s2">but it feels like there&#39;s a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.619" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">need to do a caveat here because my</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.089" end="00:49:17.609" style="s2">understanding spiral dynamics is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:19.769" style="s2">actually not that deep but it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.609" end="00:49:22.259" style="s2">there&#39;s a parallel to the shift from</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.769" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">like green to yellow well if green is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.259" end="00:49:25.739" style="s2">like things are relative eyes yeah Liz</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:28.920" style="s2">like okay but what do you care about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.739" end="00:49:31.380" style="s2">like what&#39;s most work like there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.920" end="00:49:35.910" style="s2">better things than other things you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.380" end="00:49:38.249" style="s2">yeah this pragmatism yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.910" end="00:49:41.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good description of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.249" end="00:49:46.440" style="s2">cognitive tension between those two</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.160" end="00:49:49.319" style="s2">operational levels the difficulty is in</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.440" end="00:49:53.640" style="s2">the reason why it&#39;s good that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.319" end="00:49:58.309" style="s2">is too many people because green and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.640" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">relativism is so hard too many people</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.309" end="00:50:05.130" style="s2">would kind of discard it to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">faux yellow right if we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.130" end="00:50:10.140" style="s2">in these terms so that so that things</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:12.239" style="s2">become simpler but because but they</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.140" end="00:50:16.229" style="s2">become simple in a reduced way if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.239" end="00:50:19.289" style="s2">truly commit to the skill sets and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.229" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">capacities at the pluralistic stage that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.289" end="00:50:25.339" style="s2">shift is much harder because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:28.979" style="s2">that the relativistic view goes away</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.339" end="00:50:30.900" style="s2">it&#39;s that and something else you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.979" end="00:50:33.509" style="s2">this is why the term transcend and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.900" end="00:50:35.489" style="s2">include is difficult because when people</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.509" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">think of transcending pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.489" end="00:50:43.469" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that oh done with all</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:49.099" style="s2">that difficulty now pluralism is always</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.469" end="00:50:52.349" style="s2">difficult right it&#39;s always difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.099" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">so that so the fact that you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.349" end="00:50:59.339" style="s2">there and it&#39;s more complex is to me a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:01.370" style="s2">sign that it&#39;s healthier and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.339" end="00:51:04.760" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.370" end="00:51:07.430" style="s2">have intuitively identified people that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.760" end="00:51:09.590" style="s2">have made the move in this false way I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.430" end="00:51:12.520" style="s2">mean you can just tell I mean they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.590" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">got something of the integrative aspect</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.520" end="00:51:19.700" style="s2">but they no longer include the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:22.100" style="s2">pluralistic that the immensely complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.700" end="00:51:25.670" style="s2">situation of the pluralistic viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.100" end="00:51:32.900" style="s2">is too easy to skip through it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.670" end="00:51:40.580" style="s2">very yeah I think it&#39;s very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.900" end="00:51:44.840" style="s2">big skill sets challenge and to say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.580" end="00:51:50.660" style="s2">this isn&#39;t that the way I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.840" end="00:51:53.270" style="s2">it isn&#39;t isn&#39;t only and not even</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.660" end="00:51:58.780" style="s2">primarily cognitive the way I wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.270" end="00:52:00.980" style="s2">is like very much so fusing everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:03.550" style="s2">could say it&#39;s this Robles not only</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.980" end="00:52:10.030" style="s2">visceral either it&#39;s like everything all</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:15.290" style="s2">everything and so it goes really deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.030" end="00:52:18.680" style="s2">good yeah yeah it&#39;s a whole paradigm you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.290" end="00:52:20.630" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the way values come</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.680" end="00:52:23.030" style="s2">up it&#39;s the way you just described</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.630" end="00:52:28.040" style="s2">spiritual insight gets relativized</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.030" end="00:52:30.500" style="s2">everything is always i wanna i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.040" end="00:52:33.560" style="s2">touch it on this relativize word so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.500" end="00:52:34.850" style="s2">owe you called it now here&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.560" end="00:52:37.430" style="s2">million ask you this question you use</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.850" end="00:52:40.820" style="s2">the word I wrote it down relation alized</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.430" end="00:52:42.890" style="s2">versus relativize yes yeah I did that on</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.820" end="00:52:45.590" style="s2">purpose yeah so let&#39;s talk about that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.890" end="00:52:46.790" style="s2">wrote it down cuz I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.590" end="00:52:48.440" style="s2">couple things here which i haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.500" end="00:53:38.250" style="s2">relationship and that somehow has seeded</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.230" end="00:53:41.369" style="s2">is has been a seed for my for my own my</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.250" end="00:53:43.530" style="s2">own insights into what this world is and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.369" end="00:53:46.770" style="s2">it&#39;s made out of and relationship feels</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.530" end="00:53:50.700" style="s2">like the best word for it like not</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.770" end="00:53:52.380" style="s2">emptiness or it&#39;s not being is not one</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.700" end="00:53:54.180" style="s2">taste I mean all of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.380" end="00:53:59.160" style="s2">true too but if you get down to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.180" end="00:54:02.490" style="s2">paradox of self and other like at all</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.160" end="00:54:05.180" style="s2">scales what feels like is going on at</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.490" end="00:54:08.670" style="s2">all moments is relationship and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.180" end="00:54:10.050" style="s2">somehow seems to contain the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.670" end="00:54:16.099" style="s2">and the personal at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.050" end="00:54:19.500" style="s2">everything is relationship so that feels</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.099" end="00:54:22.080" style="s2">warm to me and it feels profound where</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.500" end="00:54:26.930" style="s2">the world where the word relativized has</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.080" end="00:54:29.550" style="s2">connotations of flattened or less and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:32.130" style="s2">less significant or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.550" end="00:54:36.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s not that&#39;s not what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.130" end="00:54:37.830" style="s2">nice I mean although like I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.119" end="00:54:40.080" style="s2">some shades of that which come with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.830" end="00:54:43.950" style="s2">feeling of me ilysm but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.080" end="00:54:46.440" style="s2">actually more like intimacy like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.950" end="00:54:48.839" style="s2">engaging intimately everything is</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.440" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">engaging intimately at all times with</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.839" end="00:54:54.180" style="s2">with each with each other and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">intimacy feels like the heart of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.180" end="00:55:08.119" style="s2">going on here yeah I mean I I would say</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:12.750" style="s2">that my use of the term relativized</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.119" end="00:55:14.190" style="s2">should be interpreted more like describe</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.750" end="00:55:23.160" style="s2">the leash</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.190" end="00:55:25.560" style="s2">can relation alized relativism actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.160" end="00:55:28.830" style="s2">comes from you know fixing a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.560" end="00:55:31.590" style="s2">reference or value and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.830" end="00:55:34.290" style="s2">those fixed frames are relative because</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.590" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">everything is relation alized right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.290" end="00:55:41.400" style="s2">relation alized is the reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:44.010" style="s2">come up with this apparent illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.400" end="00:55:47.250" style="s2">relative values and relative this and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.010" end="00:55:55.080" style="s2">relative that so yeah that&#39;s it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.250" end="00:55:58.050" style="s2">good distinction I think and thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.080" end="00:56:02.780" style="s2">you know of course it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.050" end="00:56:06.680" style="s2">because we think of these as cultural or</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.780" end="00:56:11.130" style="s2">interpersonal interest objective</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.680" end="00:56:14.840" style="s2">paradigm shifts but science also often</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.130" end="00:56:19.560" style="s2">leads in in the interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.840" end="00:56:21.480" style="s2">reality it when you know there is in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.560" end="00:56:23.100" style="s2">lot of quantum science now they talk</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.480" end="00:56:27.060" style="s2">about there are no things there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.100" end="00:56:30.750" style="s2">events and events are only relations you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.060" end="00:56:33.710" style="s2">know there&#39;s just relational fields and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.750" end="00:56:40.380" style="s2">and then people like to lose and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.710" end="00:56:44.370" style="s2">Guittard and there they you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.380" end="00:56:50.150" style="s2">a lot of people who have moved toward</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.370" end="00:56:54.750" style="s2">this kind of new event relations</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.150" end="00:56:57.690" style="s2">cosmology languaging what it what things</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.750" end="00:57:02.490" style="s2">what things what are not things but just</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.690" end="00:57:05.720" style="s2">just as you said so instead of saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.490" end="00:57:08.460" style="s2">for example the pen n theists were hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.720" end="00:57:10.050" style="s2">strong to say there&#39;s consciousness all</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.460" end="00:57:12.030" style="s2">the way up and all the way down that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.050" end="00:57:14.460" style="s2">that gets a little tricky but if you say</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.030" end="00:57:16.320" style="s2">there&#39;s relationship all the way and up</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.460" end="00:57:21.120" style="s2">and down within the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.320" end="00:57:23.100" style="s2">a purse a human and a human is not only</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.120" end="00:57:24.980" style="s2">different than the relationship and Adam</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.100" end="00:57:28.049" style="s2">and an atom has but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.980" end="00:57:29.939" style="s2">relationship there&#39;s different ranges</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.049" end="00:57:33.660" style="s2">a relationship that humans and humans</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.939" end="00:57:38.039" style="s2">can have right so so that word kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.660" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">serves serves better than than some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.039" end="00:57:50.670" style="s2">the other ways of describing it so how</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:57.390" style="s2">does Neil ism why would this view of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.670" end="00:58:01.319" style="s2">relation alized reality play with this</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.390" end="00:58:05.189" style="s2">this notion of neil ism how do i how</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.319" end="00:58:08.489" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship between that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.189" end="00:58:11.729" style="s2">know yeah I mean so so we said when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.489" end="00:58:14.699" style="s2">to use the term relative we understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.729" end="00:58:17.400" style="s2">how that sits with neo lozeau more is</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.699" end="00:58:19.619" style="s2">more prone to knee ilysm so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.400" end="00:58:23.809" style="s2">move the concept of knee ilysm into this</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.619" end="00:58:23.809" style="s2">notion of relation alized right</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.110" end="00:58:50.260" style="s2">for myself I don&#39;t know um it could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.500" end="00:58:52.120" style="s2">that I like what you said about putting</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.260" end="00:58:55.390" style="s2">in too much effort to make an insight</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.120" end="00:59:03.310" style="s2">practical like that feels like a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.390" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">very strong potential and or wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.310" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">like holding on to a certain ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:13.300" style="s2">showing up in the world in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:15.850" style="s2">or wanting to be successful which I</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.300" end="00:59:22.930" style="s2">still want but in ways that are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.850" end="00:59:24.520" style="s2">somehow creating like more feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.930" end="00:59:32.140" style="s2">darkness and tragedy or something like</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.520" end="00:59:34.270" style="s2">that no it&#39;s it&#39;s unclear yeah I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.140" end="00:59:36.250" style="s2">sitting I&#39;m just like total I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.270" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">middle of it and it&#39;s and it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.250" end="00:59:41.350" style="s2">another thread for me is again somehow</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:44.560" style="s2">this the relational izing of and</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.350" end="00:59:46.900" style="s2">everything even life and death makes it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.560" end="00:59:49.990" style="s2">both feel like it&#39;s a possibility that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.900" end="00:59:54.840" style="s2">can&#39;t escape the world even even if I</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.990" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">were to die anyway yet at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.840" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">life itself and engagements with life</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.090" end="01:00:05.410" style="s2">are all sort of yeah it&#39;s very personal</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:06.550" style="s2">it&#39;s very personal you know and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.410" end="01:00:09.820" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re losing their</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.550" end="01:00:11.110" style="s2">excitement or their flavor and I&#39;ll but</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.820" end="01:00:15.160" style="s2">there is something to effort you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.110" end="01:00:17.980" style="s2">like at least for where I&#39;m at now the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.160" end="01:00:21.100" style="s2">lesson that I&#39;m learning is not has not</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.980" end="01:00:22.600" style="s2">been effortlessness the lesson that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.100" end="01:00:25.480" style="s2">learning is that all things that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.600" end="01:00:28.630" style="s2">worthwhile take continued effort and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.480" end="01:00:31.540" style="s2">work to bring to fruition mm-hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.630" end="01:00:34.270" style="s2">a burden you know that&#39;s i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.540" end="01:00:39.859" style="s2">actually all that good at at practice</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.270" end="01:00:42.410" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.859" end="01:00:44.690" style="s2">you know there&#39;s something there too for</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.410" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">me the the personal problem I said this</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.690" end="01:00:49.519" style="s2">the other day I when I said in a joke</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:53.960" style="s2">book you know we&#39;re talking about I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.519" end="01:01:00.200" style="s2">talking to somebody who&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.960" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">business person and wanted to skype with</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.200" end="01:01:16.309" style="s2">me and wanted to learn from me and as as</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:19.970" style="s2">quite often happens the business person</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.309" end="01:01:25.460" style="s2">has done a lot of things in their lives</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.970" end="01:01:29.480" style="s2">been quite successful has a brand does</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.460" end="01:01:34.190" style="s2">consulting blah blah blah but they end</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.480" end="01:01:35.930" style="s2">up being bored right so we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.190" end="01:01:37.730" style="s2">around a little bit he wanted to learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.930" end="01:01:45.799" style="s2">for me and then he says well frankly you</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.730" end="01:01:47.900" style="s2">know I&#39;m kind of bored and so I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.799" end="01:01:52.009" style="s2">talking of telling the story to a friend</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.900" end="01:01:57.140" style="s2">of mine and I was saying well I&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.009" end="01:02:01.099" style="s2">bored but but I&#39;m probably irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.140" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">right so here&#39;s the deal there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.099" end="01:02:06.200" style="s2">other side of it you know and so this</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:08.690" style="s2">person is in real name and has real</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.200" end="01:02:13.759" style="s2">money and goes all over the world and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.690" end="01:02:16.849" style="s2">can feel relevant in in their world of</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.759" end="01:02:19.579" style="s2">boredom and I&#39;m never bored but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.849" end="01:02:22.069" style="s2">actually feel pretty irrelevant to that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.579" end="01:02:23.480" style="s2">to that world and so we had a good laugh</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.069" end="01:02:25.819" style="s2">about that and that&#39;s what I mean about</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.480" end="01:02:28.039" style="s2">not the effort in doing the work I</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.819" end="01:02:29.509" style="s2">certainly put in a lot of effort to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.039" end="01:02:31.640" style="s2">all the things that I do that are</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.509" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">relevant but I can&#39;t really put any</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.640" end="01:02:36.920" style="s2">effort into making myself relevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:40.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.920" end="01:02:41.960" style="s2">within my control you know it&#39;s just and</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.460" end="01:02:46.009" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.960" end="01:02:49.130" style="s2">practical I think practical is a curious</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.009" end="01:02:53.059" style="s2">too practical relative to being relevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.130" end="01:02:53.710" style="s2">to what you know so we had a good laugh</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.059" end="01:03:00.580" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.710" end="01:03:03.880" style="s2">so I yeah so my my word for my worry is</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.580" end="01:03:07.990" style="s2">that that I&#39;m completely irrelevant yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.880" end="01:03:10.060" style="s2">like I put all this work and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.990" end="01:03:14.320" style="s2">have all these good ideas and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.060" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">think rather fondly of my productivity</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.320" end="01:03:22.660" style="s2">and then at the end of the day it seems</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:27.940" style="s2">quite irrelevant so just a different</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.660" end="01:03:35.380" style="s2">take on it I guess well but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.940" end="01:03:40.510" style="s2">bored right I know I would hope that in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.380" end="01:03:46.300" style="s2">time you feel more relevant that you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.510" end="01:03:50.830" style="s2">seen as relevant um the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.300" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting here is that I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.830" end="01:03:55.570" style="s2">heard that people who are successful</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:56.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a story there is a story and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.570" end="01:03:59.830" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know how true it is i</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.980" end="01:04:02.500" style="s2">miss me I&#39;m yes a myth there&#39;s a myth</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.830" end="01:04:06.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a myth that people on their</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:09.790" style="s2">deathbed who have had very effective or</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.310" end="01:04:12.820" style="s2">very um big lives or something look back</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.790" end="01:04:15.250" style="s2">and they think what was that all four I</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.820" end="01:04:19.630" style="s2">wish I had spent more time with my</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.250" end="01:04:21.730" style="s2">family what&#39;s good like that and at</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.630" end="01:04:24.790" style="s2">least you&#39;re living in your irrelevance</p>
