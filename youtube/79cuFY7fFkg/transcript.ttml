<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">know you&#39;re gonna have to say it the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.689" end="00:00:10.230" style="s2">social singularity social singularity</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:13.320" style="s2">and I had a chance to watch one of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:16.590" style="s2">videos on what it is and it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">we have a very similar vision of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.590" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">technology can do for civilization in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">the future that it can help us be a get</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">away from politics this centralization</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">model of politicians running in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">countries and having this top-down</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">structure of an economy that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">serve basically anyone except the 1% but</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">our visions in getting there mine is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">centralization to get there like</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">centralization without hierarchy to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">to decentralization and because I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.539" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">want to talk I&#39;m not quite sure of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">road map to get to there my vision of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">decentralization when I get like lack of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">a better word triggered by it where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">like no but it&#39;s it&#39;s is like people</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">sitting around deciding how to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">blockchain and decentralization to solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">a problem which is like figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">to turn any problem into a nail so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">can apply a hammer as opposed to how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">we solve the problem oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">decentralization can be used here or</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">centralization can be used here and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">solution and then doing so openly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">transparently so can you explain a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">of the road map of how we actually get</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">to this vision of the future the social</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">singularity yeah maybe the road map</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">metaphor is is where a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">folks go wrong and and I&#39;m not and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to direct that to you I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">it&#39;s just a sort of general you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">call it a hangover from the project of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">high modernism you know hut where high</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">modernism is sort of this sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">kind of idea that we can apply some sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:08.929" style="s2">of social scientific means for</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">architecting society or mass rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.929" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">rather than developing protocols that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.269" style="s2">will allow for</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">or a lot of iteration and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.269" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">experimentation and those are two very</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:22.709" style="s2">different things let me just give you an</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:25.640" style="s2">example of why I think you&#39;re right in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.709" end="00:02:28.110" style="s2">the way you started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.640" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">you&#39;re probably familiar with the term</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.110" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">crypto winter right which is crypto</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">winter is the sort of after a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">major crypto currencies and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">tokenized projects essentially died over</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">the last couple of years it was in great</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">part because there was a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">they called dumb money out there where</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">people were just throwing money and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.660" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">anything that was plausible and written</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">in a white paper and yet some of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">know some of the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">dreaming up these systems were</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">brilliantly brilliant people but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">really didn&#39;t connect with a cause a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:10.940" style="s2">specific customer need where they could</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">address that need and then scale up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.940" end="00:03:17.310" style="s2">in a manner that we&#39;re used to for any</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">other kind of enterprise right you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.310" end="00:03:20.940" style="s2">you if you learn to address and eat a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:24.419" style="s2">specific need get something to market as</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.940" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">an MVP then if it&#39;s creating value it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.419" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">will scale up well a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">folks were architecting these</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">magnificent systems but they really</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t connect with a specific pain</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">point out there in the world and so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:43.139" style="s2">you got were these sort of like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:45.150" style="s2">decentralized but not because we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.139" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">so to your point that&#39;s a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">happened and yet I think the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:56.819" style="s2">institutional protocols we have are are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">headed for I don&#39;t even want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.819" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">about in terms of magnitude but it could</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">very well be a collapse in our future</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">because because our governance systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">which are traditional let&#39;s say just</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">Democratic Republic&#39;s have become far</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">too top-heavy and the kind of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:19.769" style="s2">they&#39;re attempting to reckon with is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">too great for hierarchical systems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">bureaucratic systems it just it will not</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:27.550" style="s2">last won&#39;t we won&#39;t be able to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">itself either physically financially</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:32.139" style="s2">you like or otherwise and this these</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">systems are starting to show their</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.139" end="00:04:39.639" style="s2">cracks but I do agree with you in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">first point that that we need to in when</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.639" end="00:04:44.710" style="s2">we think about decentralization there</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">are all there are sort of levels of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.710" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">description to determine whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">decentralization is appropriate for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:53.379" style="s2">for that context or that level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:56.169" style="s2">description and that&#39;s really where</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.379" end="00:04:58.930" style="s2">things get interesting I think okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.169" end="00:05:01.629" style="s2">thank you that is I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.930" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">architecture on mass yes as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.629" end="00:05:06.039" style="s2">a little bit has done architecture and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">mass in my mind and then right but how</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.039" end="00:05:12.490" style="s2">do we Institute it and how do we that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">there is this you can picture this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:16.569" style="s2">utopian world and implement it but we</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.979" style="s2">don&#39;t know all of the ripple effects we</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.569" end="00:05:19.569" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.979" end="00:05:21.219" style="s2">like if you like for instance I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.569" end="00:05:23.229" style="s2">thinking of technology and we used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.219" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">feed everybody and there is this point</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.229" end="00:05:27.129" style="s2">of like oh my god our world collapses if</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">everyone&#39;s fed like our a kind that no</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.129" end="00:05:32.860" style="s2">one gets fed right like if the supply</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:34.330" style="s2">chain is in getting stuff to the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.860" end="00:05:36.909" style="s2">markets and we don&#39;t know how to feed</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.330" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">ourselves there&#39;s a point where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.909" end="00:05:42.460" style="s2">a lot of risk there right that even if</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:44.139" style="s2">somehow everyone could be fed our</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.460" end="00:05:46.360" style="s2">economy is based on people being</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.139" end="00:05:49.300" style="s2">desperate and needing to work for food</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.360" end="00:05:51.190" style="s2">and so in all the sudden everyone&#39;s fed</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:54.909" style="s2">that all collapses and if we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:56.379" style="s2">a way to actually stop the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.909" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">the collapse before allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.379" end="00:05:59.979" style="s2">collapse like cause emic collapse really</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:02.259" style="s2">because there is a collapse coming and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.979" end="00:06:03.879" style="s2">we need to be environmental one the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.259" end="00:06:05.169" style="s2">political one all of it like we can feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.879" end="00:06:07.300" style="s2">it we can feel that what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.169" end="00:06:10.449" style="s2">isn&#39;t sustainable but creating an all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.300" end="00:06:12.699" style="s2">new system that is complex still is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.449" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">complicated and an implementing it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.699" end="00:06:16.180" style="s2">all of these ripple effects so we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">like a system a protocol in place and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.180" end="00:06:20.830" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to learn what protocol is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.750" end="00:06:22.270" style="s2">to me it was just like technological</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.830" end="00:06:24.099" style="s2">jargon that must be over my head I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.270" end="00:06:25.569" style="s2">like do I need to know how to create the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.099" end="00:06:27.279" style="s2">algorithm it&#39;s like English is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.569" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">protocol like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.279" end="00:06:33.009" style="s2">it&#39;s like a sieve just a way that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:34.810" style="s2">communicate a way we can say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.009" end="00:06:36.699" style="s2">underlining we don&#39;t need to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.810" end="00:06:37.839" style="s2">what every word is but when you say word</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.699" end="00:06:39.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know we can discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.839" end="00:06:42.729" style="s2">definition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.550" end="00:06:44.440" style="s2">a disconnection and I like that because</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.729" end="00:06:46.750" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t amended maybe I&#39;m wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.440" end="00:06:49.870" style="s2">what protocol is but if I have a word</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.750" end="00:06:52.810" style="s2">and you have a word and we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.870" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">the semantics of the definition we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.810" end="00:06:56.530" style="s2">necessarily need to agree on one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:58.150" style="s2">those words be in the word I just know</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.530" end="00:07:00.940" style="s2">that when you use it you&#39;re using it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.150" end="00:07:02.590" style="s2">one context music in other context or do</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.940" end="00:07:04.690" style="s2">we have to then agree on what the word</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.590" end="00:07:06.099" style="s2">means and only use it in that context</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.690" end="00:07:08.919" style="s2">like do we have to have the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.099" end="00:07:10.360" style="s2">protocol to use like all of the like</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.919" end="00:07:14.169" style="s2">does the protocol have to be identical</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.360" end="00:07:16.470" style="s2">between us to use it together I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.169" end="00:07:19.180" style="s2">know and it&#39;s a question worth exploring</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.470" end="00:07:24.909" style="s2">I&#39;ll just tell you quickly the way I use</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.180" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">it and the way the way I&#39;m hoping to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.909" end="00:07:32.380" style="s2">heard or to to be have the message be</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:34.330" style="s2">received is pretty simple and I I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.380" end="00:07:36.490" style="s2">of it as in terms of rules or</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.330" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">institutional rules it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.490" end="00:07:43.710" style="s2">what are the rules that govern human</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:46.180" style="s2">systems and I am distinctly anti utopian</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.710" end="00:07:50.409" style="s2">when it comes to this and I&#39;ll just put</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.180" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">that straight out there I think when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.409" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">think of in terms of the appropriate set</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:55.620" style="s2">of rules institutional rules or</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:58.060" style="s2">protocols I like the term protocols</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:08:00.509" style="s2">because it harkens to technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.060" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">protocols as well and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.509" end="00:08:07.000" style="s2">intuitive to people when you say use it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">in that context you know like HTTP and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.000" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">the web allows us to have the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:15.490" style="s2">right that&#39;s a set of protocols that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">use to have the Internet and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.490" end="00:08:18.729" style="s2">this variation variety wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">emergent phenomena that we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.729" end="00:08:26.020" style="s2">possibly have predicted but we still had</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:27.940" style="s2">the rules as the substrate hm HTTP same</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.020" end="00:08:29.650" style="s2">or similar at least goes for</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.940" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">institutional rules and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.650" end="00:08:36.329" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about when I say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:40.329" style="s2">but I am NOT for a blanket or</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.329" end="00:08:42.729" style="s2">cosmopolitan set of protocols and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.329" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">instead I look of it look at it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.729" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">of what you might call a utopia of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:53.030" style="s2">utopias which is to say competitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:55.370" style="s2">governance systems when we are iterating</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.030" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">and we are trying different things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.370" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">getting localised feedback loops in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">world and one set of protocols might not</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:06.530" style="s2">comport with someone&#39;s conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:09.140" style="s2">good nor might it comport or match with</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.530" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">circumstances of time and place and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.140" end="00:09:13.490" style="s2">is a really important thing that we I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:15.410" style="s2">think a lot of people when they go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.490" end="00:09:17.330" style="s2">this sort of high modernist place if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.410" end="00:09:19.100" style="s2">need to even if they think in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.330" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">distributed systems terms there&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.100" end="00:09:22.250" style="s2">to think of it for all of humanity like</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:24.290" style="s2">we got to fix all the biggest problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.250" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">with the world by architecting a single</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.290" end="00:09:29.030" style="s2">system with a single set of protocols</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:32.270" style="s2">and save the world I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.030" end="00:09:36.830" style="s2">wrong way of going about it and I resist</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.270" end="00:09:39.950" style="s2">that because it it it requires we give</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.830" end="00:09:42.200" style="s2">up a kind of epistemic humility or a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.950" end="00:09:44.540" style="s2">of you know acknowledging the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.200" end="00:09:47.270" style="s2">limitations of what we can know and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.540" end="00:09:50.030" style="s2">will emerge from the different sets of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.270" end="00:09:52.580" style="s2">protocols but if we make different</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.030" end="00:09:57.350" style="s2">efforts in different locations we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.580" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">mimic or adopt features of other systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:01.940" style="s2">that could work in ours and try those</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:03.740" style="s2">out so we get a pluralism of systems and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.940" end="00:10:06.530" style="s2">I&#39;m super comfortable with that now in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.740" end="00:10:08.650" style="s2">fact I think that&#39;s the only way I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.530" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">there is is a that like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.650" end="00:10:14.330" style="s2">experiment and play and have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:16.070" style="s2">implications not be catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.330" end="00:10:17.390" style="s2">where like even for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.070" end="00:10:18.980" style="s2">trying and playing right but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.390" end="00:10:22.670" style="s2">financially devastating that we still</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.980" end="00:10:26.780" style="s2">have food on our table and is a big step</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.670" end="00:10:30.770" style="s2">like to make sure that that isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.780" end="00:10:32.630" style="s2">central hammer to apply to every nail</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.770" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">and turn everything into a nail and one</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.630" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">one protocol that is to admit to address</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:40.610" style="s2">everything I Laurel you were saying that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:41.030" style="s2">it was like a little bit yeah I know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.610" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.030" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">that that is what my vision of is I want</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:47.930" style="s2">people to be able to come together not</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">in a hierarchy down I&#39;m the leader and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.930" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">you listen to me and I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:53.180" style="s2">deciding the protocol and now you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:55.880" style="s2">to follow it but in a way where anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.180" end="00:10:57.980" style="s2">can have a can say how the protocol</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.880" end="00:10:59.900" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t working for them and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.980" end="00:11:01.339" style="s2">there or doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.900" end="00:11:01.800" style="s2">because I can&#39;t fix the protocol I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.339" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">underst</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.800" end="00:11:06.209" style="s2">really understand HTTP like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:08.250" style="s2">yeah okay I don&#39;t use the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.209" end="00:11:10.740" style="s2">right but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have any order</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.250" end="00:11:12.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.740" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">the backend which is part of also why</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.600" end="00:11:19.079" style="s2">decentralization is that I feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">lot of the solutions a holo chain all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.079" end="00:11:23.220" style="s2">that stuff isn&#39;t accessible to people</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">who do not understand technology and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.220" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t even include the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:29.010" style="s2">people in the conversation that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">good with technology it can&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.010" end="00:11:34.769" style="s2">that stage right it can&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:36.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like well this is just caught like</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.769" end="00:11:37.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of techies talking amongst</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.839" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">themselves like this is a no-brainer</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.860" end="00:11:43.140" style="s2">well it&#39;s a no-brainer to techies right</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:44.610" style="s2">and so don&#39;t know and if it was just if</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.140" end="00:11:45.899" style="s2">they&#39;re still gonna fix the world that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.610" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">they&#39;re still gonna create a proto PIA</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.899" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">great but I don&#39;t think they can in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">space I think that the trust we have in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:57.510" style="s2">our governments in our currency is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:12:00.060" style="s2">eroding but it started out not complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.510" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">right like it started out fairly easy to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.060" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">understand I&#39;m trading I&#39;m trading my</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:07.320" style="s2">eggs for coin coins for your cow right</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">like it was it was now it&#39;s it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.320" end="00:12:12.930" style="s2">you know via taking off the Fiat and go</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">out like it and shorting stocks and like</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.930" end="00:12:16.950" style="s2">it&#39;s way too complex how money is</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.180" end="00:12:18.870" style="s2">created in our society and the central</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.950" end="00:12:22.500" style="s2">bank&#39;s they&#39;re not owned by anyone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.870" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">become this monster but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.500" end="00:12:26.610" style="s2">that cryptocurrency in its current</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">format will take over from that because</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.610" end="00:12:29.459" style="s2">it&#39;s too complex and people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">understand it&#39;s generally techies buying</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.459" end="00:12:31.890" style="s2">cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:35.310" style="s2">or people doing it for speculation</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.890" end="00:12:37.829" style="s2">reasons whereas if we together as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.310" end="00:12:40.410" style="s2">million of us were able to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.829" end="00:12:43.079" style="s2">a cryptocurrency that was the best of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.410" end="00:12:44.760" style="s2">all of them we would already have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.079" end="00:12:46.380" style="s2">power to make that occur to currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.760" end="00:12:48.329" style="s2">right because the currency is only a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.380" end="00:12:50.579" style="s2">currency because people agree to use it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.329" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">yeah if we created one from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.579" end="00:12:54.060" style="s2">like we could create ubi</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:55.230" style="s2">tomorrow right like if million of us got</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:12:56.820" style="s2">together and said hey we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.230" end="00:12:58.709" style="s2">this cryptocurrency we&#39;re gonna say that</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.580" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">that we could the point is to create the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.500" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">protocol together right to say here is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:25.740" style="s2">what we do and then give it power that</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.740" end="00:13:29.010" style="s2">centralization rights it&#39;s a million of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.630" end="00:13:31.260" style="s2">us coming together it&#39;s not a million of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.010" end="00:13:32.970" style="s2">us allowing five people to come together</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.260" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">and tell us what perfect currency we</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.970" end="00:13:38.460" style="s2">should use and so that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:42.030" style="s2">decentralization in my mind is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.460" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">crypto currency where it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.030" end="00:13:46.020" style="s2">all competing with each other so no one</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:47.610" style="s2">emerges is the winner and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.020" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">because they&#39;re like but one of us is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.610" end="00:13:50.940" style="s2">the solution it&#39;s stopping people from</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">realizing that they kind of need to come</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.940" end="00:13:54.180" style="s2">together and like that&#39;s the protocol I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">want to concentrate on it&#39;s like how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.180" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">we come together to create things how</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">can we get a million people together to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:02.580" style="s2">create their own healthcare system and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:04.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s decentralization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.580" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">in my vision of what I want to create in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.650" end="00:14:09.390" style="s2">the world which isn&#39;t the vision but</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:12.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have to keep testing it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.390" end="00:14:14.610" style="s2">keep saying is this broken in the system</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.780" end="00:14:18.270" style="s2">is this broken and me like it&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.610" end="00:14:21.630" style="s2">ego or is it something&#39;s here right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.270" end="00:14:25.980" style="s2">something here to play with and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.630" end="00:14:27.420" style="s2">is going to that participation it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.980" end="00:14:30.030" style="s2">like if we&#39;re able to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.420" end="00:14:32.090" style="s2">together we have so much more power than</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.030" end="00:14:35.100" style="s2">if there&#39;s all of these dissipated</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.090" end="00:14:37.830" style="s2">projects and energy and funding and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.100" end="00:14:40.350" style="s2">everything like it&#39;s it&#39;s in my mind how</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.830" end="00:14:42.030" style="s2">we out-compete they may in game A&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.350" end="00:14:47.070" style="s2">world because it is the amazing world is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.030" end="00:14:48.990" style="s2">by creating something that is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.070" end="00:14:50.640" style="s2">sent like centralized in the way not</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.990" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a tiny group of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.640" end="00:14:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s giving puppets in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:57.180" style="s2">over the masses but in a way that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.470" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">how do we get the masses together to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.180" end="00:15:01.320" style="s2">solve a problem even if there&#39;s a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:03.840" style="s2">or even our let me push back against</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.320" end="00:15:07.530" style="s2">that a little bit yeah in a in a you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.840" end="00:15:09.390" style="s2">know hopefully a fruitful way and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.530" end="00:15:11.880" style="s2">have to bear with me because here we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.390" end="00:15:14.120" style="s2">have what you might call layers of human</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.880" end="00:15:16.410" style="s2">stack and layers of the software stack</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.120" end="00:15:19.290" style="s2">and you might not like this example</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.410" end="00:15:21.180" style="s2">given your if you if you have certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.290" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">kinds of bad experiences or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.180" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">just bear with me for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:29.340" style="s2">around 2013 I guess it would would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:33.030" style="s2">been maybe 2012</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.340" end="00:15:36.690" style="s2">there was what you might call a legal</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.030" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">gray area in which this certain company</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.690" end="00:15:44.700" style="s2">began to operate they clued together a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:46.350" style="s2">bunch of existing technology and created</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.700" end="00:15:49.380" style="s2">what we know now as uber</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.350" end="00:15:51.030" style="s2">okay now uber is not a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.380" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">technology in the same way that holo</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.030" end="00:15:55.350" style="s2">chain is it&#39;s very centralized you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.060" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">it&#39;s sitting on a bunch of servers and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.350" end="00:15:59.400" style="s2">there are a bunch of guys in Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">Valley you know tech bros managing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.400" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">and all this stuff but it is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:08.310" style="s2">distributed or decentralized at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:10.860" style="s2">human layer right so they&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.310" end="00:16:14.490" style="s2">piece out of it which is and extracting</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.860" end="00:16:16.950" style="s2">a whole a lot out of the transaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.490" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">which is something that holo chain might</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.950" end="00:16:20.220" style="s2">folks not might not like and so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:25.620" style="s2">might want to come up with a competitor</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.220" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">that leaves more to the to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.620" end="00:16:29.820" style="s2">driver into the rider and doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">out so much of it doesn&#39;t extract so</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.820" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">much as a an intermediary however if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.470" end="00:16:38.790" style="s2">just look at it at where they were in</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:42.690" style="s2">terms of that time in place it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.790" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">highly there&#39;s a there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.690" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">between distributed and decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:49.740" style="s2">but it allowed to disintermediate the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:52.380" style="s2">taxi monopoly so relative to what had</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.740" end="00:16:54.900" style="s2">come before they were able to gain</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.380" end="00:16:57.510" style="s2">massive constituencies of support and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.900" end="00:16:59.910" style="s2">use relative to the status quo ante</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.510" end="00:17:03.950" style="s2">right relative to whatever come before</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.910" end="00:17:07.950" style="s2">and that was an important lesson about</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.950" end="00:17:10.410" style="s2">the prospect of decentralization right</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.950" end="00:17:12.540" style="s2">around then Bitcoin was ascendant people</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.410" end="00:17:14.370" style="s2">knew what it was it was starting and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.540" end="00:17:17.130" style="s2">then you got decentralization at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.370" end="00:17:18.810" style="s2">level of technology now all the chain</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.130" end="00:17:20.430" style="s2">people are gonna say not fully</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.810" end="00:17:24.390" style="s2">decentralized because you you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.430" end="00:17:27.060" style="s2">there&#39;s there still it&#39;s not ideally</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.390" end="00:17:28.920" style="s2">decentralized but we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.060" end="00:17:33.720" style="s2">relative to what had come before I like</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.920" end="00:17:37.920" style="s2">to refer to Stewart Stewart Kaufman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.720" end="00:17:39.260" style="s2">phase phrase rather the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.920" end="00:17:41.870" style="s2">possible so</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.260" end="00:17:43.940" style="s2">at that point in time relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.870" end="00:17:46.670" style="s2">past that was more decentralized more</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.940" end="00:17:48.950" style="s2">distributed than it had been ever before</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.670" end="00:17:52.390" style="s2">and by virtue of that they were able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.950" end="00:17:54.950" style="s2">gain massive constituencies of support</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.390" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">but a bunch of customers essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.950" end="00:18:03.140" style="s2">that changed the game the legal gray</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:04.970" style="s2">areas became less gray over time but in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.140" end="00:18:06.560" style="s2">operating in that we will crater they</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.970" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">were able to get a foothold and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.560" end="00:18:12.650" style="s2">massively expand right so whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">think about new Birds is is as a company</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.650" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">is one thing but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.600" end="00:18:20.170" style="s2">about it is the what had been before</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">which was government government-granted</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.170" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">monopolies through the the taxi</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.850" end="00:18:27.380" style="s2">medallion system were highly extractive</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">were highly game a in orientation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.380" end="00:18:33.140" style="s2">any indeed almost everything government</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:36.050" style="s2">touches becomes game a because of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.140" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">very nature of government and as being</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.050" end="00:18:42.050" style="s2">hierarchical so you might say they</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:46.280" style="s2">sprinkled in a little bit of game be to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.050" end="00:18:48.140" style="s2">get uber and and there&#39;s still game a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.280" end="00:18:50.180" style="s2">elements to it it&#39;s kind of a hybrid and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.140" end="00:18:51.530" style="s2">as you move forward in time and start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.180" end="00:18:53.660" style="s2">develop more and more of these systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.530" end="00:18:57.500" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get more and more game</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.660" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">beat elements however it&#39;s going to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:04.430" style="s2">these experiments experiments to first</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:08.420" style="s2">show that they can work and then attract</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.430" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">those constituencies voluntarily it you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.420" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">know if you if you were to say all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:13.970" style="s2">people are doing all these crazy</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:15.980" style="s2">projects but mine is the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.970" end="00:19:19.310" style="s2">definitely gonna win because mines the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.980" end="00:19:21.860" style="s2">one that is is the awesomest yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.310" end="00:19:25.070" style="s2">like if awesomest is a word I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.860" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">make it one then then yeah go for it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.070" end="00:19:29.320" style="s2">then then can you attract it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">thing with systems of governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.320" end="00:19:34.220" style="s2">territorial systems of governance if</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">your system of governance is so Austin</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.220" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">can you attract people from other</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:42.230" style="s2">jurisdictions right now we&#39;re seeing a</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.149" end="00:20:44.179" style="s2">think competition is a game B phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.080" end="00:20:46.220" style="s2">and probably half the folks in the game</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.129" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">hope it doesn&#39;t cuz I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">promising but it&#39;s just really early so</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.090" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">Darwinist I&#39;m trying to sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.999" end="00:21:47.899" style="s2">Darwinist in this in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:51.259" style="s2">things either succeed or fail in an</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:02.149" style="s2">true period if there&#39;s no way to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.549" end="00:22:04.190" style="s2">that you can try to lengthen the life of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.149" end="00:22:06.150" style="s2">the system by subsidizing it and shoring</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.190" end="00:22:08.600" style="s2">it up but if it will eventually</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.150" end="00:22:11.160" style="s2">we fail if it&#39;s not serving human needs</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:14.520" style="s2">absolutely and it should like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.160" end="00:22:16.140" style="s2">where I don&#39;t think anything I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.520" end="00:22:17.310" style="s2">create or we want to create it has to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.140" end="00:22:20.310" style="s2">because gaming is already in existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.310" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">has to out-compete game a in its world</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.310" end="00:22:23.670" style="s2">ie the marketplace it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">something that it&#39;s a natural attractor</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.670" end="00:22:29.130" style="s2">that isn&#39;t something that is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">use this or else right it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.130" end="00:22:35.010" style="s2">government and it isn&#39;t but my issue is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:36.810" style="s2">if we create game a corporation&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.010" end="00:22:38.580" style="s2">that are for profit that or not for</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.810" end="00:22:39.960" style="s2">profit but I don&#39;t I can&#39;t be part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.580" end="00:22:41.610" style="s2">your organization because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.960" end="00:22:45.420" style="s2">invited right I I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.610" end="00:22:47.460" style="s2">created your protocol then and I totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.420" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">want some trains out here wanna keep you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.460" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">team Ed&#39;s did not work out this morning</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.110" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">I just unpacked to help let me I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:58.590" style="s2">keep going down that because you were my</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:23:00.410" style="s2">ears pricked up so like Karen let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.590" end="00:23:04.350" style="s2">to the code of the question of profit</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.410" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">hey when you had revenue in excess of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.350" end="00:23:09.690" style="s2">cost why would you ever want to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:12.270" style="s2">of that because that is that what that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.690" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">does that profit and loss system tells</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.270" end="00:23:17.340" style="s2">you whether or not some system some</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:22.020" style="s2">agglomeration of people is creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.340" end="00:23:23.880" style="s2">value right though because it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:26.010" style="s2">this is so this is probably where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.880" end="00:23:29.550" style="s2">just gonna disagree because I am like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.010" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">my background is in finance and biology</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.550" end="00:23:34.140" style="s2">so I understand evolution I understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">like Darwin and and that that side I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.140" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">don&#39;t think the competition of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:40.770" style="s2">wrong I think it can get us to the best</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.610" end="00:23:42.090" style="s2">ideas I also think we&#39;ve kind of gone</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.770" end="00:23:43.710" style="s2">through history to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.090" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">competitions done what it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.710" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">do and now cooperation needs not take</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:50.940" style="s2">over but take over like it can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:52.140" style="s2">over by just say by outline competition</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.940" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s ridiculous that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.140" end="00:23:56.730" style="s2">what communism did and it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:59.820" style="s2">but creating a system that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.730" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">option for cooperation to out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.820" end="00:24:04.440" style="s2">competition only if it&#39;s successful</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">right so in that in the stance of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.440" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">Facebook nothing is going to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:10.410" style="s2">take over face probably and take over</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:11.610" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s role in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.410" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">because they have your friends and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.610" end="00:24:14.860" style="s2">family there can be an own social media</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.900" style="s2">enterprise there might be a decent</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.860" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">last one that does it but the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.900" end="00:24:19.960" style="s2">they have your friends and family so</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.520" end="00:24:21.970" style="s2">unless you can bring over your friends</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.960" end="00:24:24.280" style="s2">and family to the decentralized one like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.970" end="00:24:26.290" style="s2">they use your Facebook data it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.280" end="00:24:28.510" style="s2">really gonna work no one person coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.290" end="00:24:30.549" style="s2">up with a new protocol that they own and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.510" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">they are in competition with each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.549" end="00:24:33.670" style="s2">is going to be able to take over</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.410" style="s2">Facebook as Facebook&#39;s kind of monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.670" end="00:24:37.059" style="s2">in that rope the only way we could take</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.410" end="00:24:39.429" style="s2">it over or ie create something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.059" end="00:24:40.900" style="s2">would have competed marketplace is by</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.429" end="00:24:43.420" style="s2">creating something together something</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.900" end="00:24:45.040" style="s2">that fills the function and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.420" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">use so let&#39;s say 10,000 I must get</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.040" end="00:24:48.610" style="s2">together that are somewhat friends that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:51.010" style="s2">way right we&#39;re like somewhat connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.610" end="00:24:52.330" style="s2">so that it&#39;s the threshold of usability</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.010" end="00:24:53.710" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to get be on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.330" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">social media platform and have no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.710" end="00:24:56.770" style="s2">else on there you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:24:59.710" style="s2">have conversations there meaningful or</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.770" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">interactions there meaningful and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:03.820" style="s2">competition has its role because you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">want to kind of have a bunch like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.820" end="00:25:08.919" style="s2">bunch of projects to see which one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">like well you were talking about uber I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.919" end="00:25:13.720" style="s2">was like oh how interesting because now</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">I&#39;m Buber spaces there right this what</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.720" end="00:25:19.380" style="s2">is the what they call what is Hoover in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:22.809" style="s2">Airbnb plenty centralized it&#39;s proud</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.380" end="00:25:24.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.809" end="00:25:26.710" style="s2">of it&#39;s decentralized it at the human</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.760" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">layer I think yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.710" end="00:25:31.750" style="s2">yeah that like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">Boober for profit right the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.750" end="00:25:36.280" style="s2">uber is created so that the shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:39.010" style="s2">get the profit is that what you mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.280" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">mean the profit having the the worker</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.010" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">the driver and the the writer be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">collaborate to say what is a fair price</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:48.340" style="s2">so you can live and also how can we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:50.110" style="s2">recreate new systems so that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.340" end="00:25:53.290" style="s2">afford uber and it&#39;s not even in</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.110" end="00:25:54.910" style="s2">Vancouver yet but what are the systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.290" end="00:25:56.770" style="s2">we could create so I could afford it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.910" end="00:25:58.419" style="s2">yet the driver still makes the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.770" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">money right like there&#39;s ways we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.419" end="00:26:03.190" style="s2">things cooperatively that you can never</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">do in competition but it&#39;s not it but if</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.190" end="00:26:07.090" style="s2">we say you can&#39;t possibly create a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:10.210" style="s2">competing one you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.090" end="00:26:12.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not okay but if your competition</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.210" end="00:26:13.960" style="s2">is uber right we&#39;re profit goes to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.610" end="00:26:16.929" style="s2">shareholders you&#39;re not going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.960" end="00:26:18.370" style="s2">to compete because our profit is go is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.929" end="00:26:20.110" style="s2">stained with between the driver and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.370" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">user and creating the infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.110" end="00:26:24.010" style="s2">maintaining it but we are together able</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:25.780" style="s2">to problem-solve in a way that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.010" end="00:26:27.730" style="s2">this is broke and I&#39;m going to go off</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.780" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">and create a competitor that instead is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.730" end="00:26:30.909" style="s2">this is broke</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:33.820" style="s2">and let&#39;s improve it let&#39;s create the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.909" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">diversity within it okay so let me let</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.820" end="00:26:36.549" style="s2">me just um let me let me address a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:38.169" style="s2">couple of points here and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.549" end="00:26:40.690" style="s2">they&#39;re really interesting ones you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.169" end="00:26:43.390" style="s2">the first thing I want to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.690" end="00:26:46.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get rid of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.390" end="00:26:47.770" style="s2">profit and that means and let me just</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.210" end="00:26:49.750" style="s2">put it in revenue and revenue and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.770" end="00:26:51.130" style="s2">excessive costs if your costs exceed</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.750" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">your revenue no matter what your system</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.130" end="00:26:56.770" style="s2">is your system is going to die that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">just a very fundamental thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.770" end="00:27:01.210" style="s2">can&#39;t change we&#39;d like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:02.529" style="s2">excise profit from the world because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.210" end="00:27:04.929" style="s2">think of it in terms of where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.529" end="00:27:08.200" style="s2">profits go and that&#39;s highly centralized</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.929" end="00:27:10.149" style="s2">no no no I don&#39;t want to say and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.200" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">actually believe it&#39;s quite promising</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.149" end="00:27:15.100" style="s2">that we develop systems are on what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">called platform cooperatives which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.100" end="00:27:19.899" style="s2">basically technologically enabled means</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.539" style="s2">for people to form a operatives where</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.899" end="00:27:25.690" style="s2">the profits are shared among different</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.539" end="00:27:27.220" style="s2">members of the collective perhaps in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.690" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">more egalitarian way I don&#39;t think you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.220" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">want it to be entirely egalitarian for</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:34.330" style="s2">reasons that we can go into later but</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.240" end="00:27:37.779" style="s2">certainly that there would be a more a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:39.610" style="s2">blanket distribution and the risk of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.779" end="00:27:42.029" style="s2">enterprise is also shared among the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.610" end="00:27:44.470" style="s2">enterprise as well okay among the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.029" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">participants the in the co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.470" end="00:27:49.179" style="s2">that is totally fine for me that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:51.070" style="s2">still having revenue niz in excess of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.179" end="00:27:53.590" style="s2">cost it&#39;s just how those are distributed</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.070" end="00:27:56.950" style="s2">among the team members that changes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.590" end="00:27:59.340" style="s2">I&#39;m all for that in fact I&#39;m a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.950" end="00:28:02.409" style="s2">proponent of that there&#39;s a competitor a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.340" end="00:28:03.909" style="s2">tuber in Austin right now that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.409" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">working for a couple years and is trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.909" end="00:28:08.289" style="s2">to get get to market and I think any day</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:10.270" style="s2">now that&#39;s gonna happen called Arcade</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.289" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">City an arcade City does just that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.270" end="00:28:15.940" style="s2">think they take a fraction of what uber</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:18.399" style="s2">does and they developed a guild system</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.940" end="00:28:20.260" style="s2">and stuff for four different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.399" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">you know resolving conflicts and things</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.260" end="00:28:26.649" style="s2">like that that are centralized the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:28.600" style="s2">doober and add to you know costs the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.649" end="00:28:30.909" style="s2">they do it is they they decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.600" end="00:28:33.820" style="s2">that and the the guilds handle it but</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.909" end="00:28:37.659" style="s2">but basically the drivers and riders if</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.820" end="00:28:40.410" style="s2">you look at the like a CPV triangle</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.659" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">there&#39;s capturable value between</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.410" end="00:28:48.090" style="s2">price and cost okay so I pay you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:49.890" style="s2">something costs a certain amount and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.090" end="00:28:51.630" style="s2">actual price of it is established over</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.890" end="00:28:54.630" style="s2">here and in between is the capturable</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.630" end="00:28:56.160" style="s2">value people don&#39;t like Walmart because</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.630" end="00:29:00.270" style="s2">they push push push push the capturable</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.160" end="00:29:02.730" style="s2">value in the direction of your customer</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.270" end="00:29:04.530" style="s2">and leaving very little for the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.730" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">folks who are in their ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.530" end="00:29:10.290" style="s2">that&#39;s hard for some of their suppliers</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:12.600" style="s2">whereas you know more conscientious or</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.290" end="00:29:14.760" style="s2">conscious firms if you like will try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.600" end="00:29:16.140" style="s2">nail it between the you know split at</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.760" end="00:29:18.230" style="s2">half and half between the capturable</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.140" end="00:29:20.580" style="s2">values of the party of the parties</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.230" end="00:29:24.180" style="s2">likewise I think a competitor is going</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.580" end="00:29:27.300" style="s2">to come along to Ober and the value that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.180" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">can be captured between price and cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.300" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">is going to go more to the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:36.630" style="s2">many than it is to the top-down few that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:38.460" style="s2">I&#39;m all for I think that&#39;s great and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.630" end="00:29:40.260" style="s2">do think in the long term once these</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.460" end="00:29:42.630" style="s2">systems are appropriately architected so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.260" end="00:29:44.070" style="s2">they&#39;re easy to use so the complexities</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:45.660" style="s2">on the back end and not the front end</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.070" end="00:29:47.040" style="s2">these systems are going to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.660" end="00:29:49.080" style="s2">crushing all of these top-down</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.040" end="00:29:51.210" style="s2">corporations because they&#39;re organized</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.080" end="00:29:54.390" style="s2">like hierarchies instead of hard mines</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:56.160" style="s2">yeah and we want to move to a hive mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.390" end="00:29:57.210" style="s2">state of affair to the extent we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.160" end="00:29:59.640" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.210" end="00:30:01.700" style="s2">but with Weir&#39;s in our nation see in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.640" end="00:30:04.370" style="s2">developing some of these technologies</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.700" end="00:30:06.090" style="s2">you know so we&#39;ve got a long way to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:07.590" style="s2">absolutely when the other thing is new</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.090" end="00:30:08.670" style="s2">you&#39;re first talking about uber because</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.590" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">of what I said about the cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.670" end="00:30:12.300" style="s2">right the million of us getting together</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">and creating a new one would it would</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.300" end="00:30:17.970" style="s2">have a foothold overnight um but that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:20.490" style="s2">grey area right that legal gray area</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.970" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">that honestly the collective can&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.490" end="00:30:24.930" style="s2">in once we&#39;re big enough we can compress</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:26.220" style="s2">were big enough we can dismantle the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.930" end="00:30:29.130" style="s2">patent system we can do any of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.220" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">stuff but if you don&#39;t even if a million</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.130" end="00:30:33.240" style="s2">of us got together before uber was</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:35.670" style="s2">created and said let&#39;s create a car uber</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.240" end="00:30:37.980" style="s2">but distribute it alike but the hive</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.670" end="00:30:39.630" style="s2">mind the platform cooperative it</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.980" end="00:30:41.010" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t take off because legal would</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.630" end="00:30:42.690" style="s2">have deceptive right it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.010" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">low this is illegal this is this and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:46.110" style="s2">there is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:48.810" style="s2">oddly enough right there I mean I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.110" end="00:30:52.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve been wrapping up a project that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.810" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">has I&#39;ve had to pivot so many times</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:57.420" style="s2">learning the different ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:31:00.390" style="s2">it&#39;s illegal to do it and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.420" end="00:31:05.010" style="s2">frustrating as hell it&#39;s you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.390" end="00:31:07.530" style="s2">a lot of people you know for me this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:12.060" style="s2">a post partisan post political position</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.530" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">and when I say this it&#39;s that regulation</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.060" end="00:31:17.160" style="s2">works both ways people who are partisans</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">on the Left say all regulation is good</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.160" end="00:31:23.880" style="s2">regulation it&#39;s for the common good blah</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:25.950" style="s2">blah blah and people on the right say</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.880" end="00:31:29.340" style="s2">you know stop regulating you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.950" end="00:31:32.570" style="s2">do anything but what what you usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.340" end="00:31:35.370" style="s2">both fail to realize is that regulations</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.570" end="00:31:37.800" style="s2">almost always work to the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.370" end="00:31:39.990" style="s2">incumbents who have a vested interest in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.800" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">the status quo of those regulations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.990" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">those incumbents use the regulations to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:45.330" style="s2">keep a boot in the neck of competitors</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.650" end="00:31:47.610" style="s2">especially the small ones and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.330" end="00:31:50.040" style="s2">really easy to snuff them out if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.610" end="00:31:53.850" style="s2">have the regulatory state on your side</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.040" end="00:31:55.230" style="s2">that happens all the time so the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.850" end="00:31:57.030" style="s2">stuff we&#39;re trying to do doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.230" end="00:31:58.800" style="s2">what our intentions are some of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.030" end="00:32:00.630" style="s2">will never come into existence simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.800" end="00:32:02.220" style="s2">because they&#39;ll be regulated away and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.630" end="00:32:04.980" style="s2">behind the scenes will be a special</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.220" end="00:32:06.810" style="s2">interest corporation going make sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.980" end="00:32:09.030" style="s2">that that gets enforced because we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.020" end="00:35:38.650" style="s2">cooperative is making it further for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.240" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">decision of their purpose which means</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.650" end="00:35:42.340" style="s2">they have to keep profit in mind rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:44.350" style="s2">than making it for the decision of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.340" end="00:35:48.190" style="s2">profit but they have to keep purpose in</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.350" end="00:35:50.050" style="s2">mind yeah the the participants in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.190" end="00:35:55.030" style="s2">platform cooperative are in it for</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.030" end="00:36:01.300" style="s2">where what I&#39;m proposing we do what my</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.250" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">mission is is a platform cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.300" end="00:36:05.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a consumer cooperative not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.910" style="s2">worker cooperative worker cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.590" end="00:36:08.380" style="s2">are there to make money there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.910" end="00:36:10.030" style="s2">workers right they&#39;re there to make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.380" end="00:36:13.600" style="s2">wage and so they&#39;re gonna make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.030" end="00:36:15.910" style="s2">to make a wage and worker cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.600" end="00:36:17.430" style="s2">are historically amazing and also making</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.910" end="00:36:19.180" style="s2">socially and environmentally responsible</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.430" end="00:36:20.020" style="s2">decisions because they can see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.180" end="00:36:21.940" style="s2">bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.020" end="00:36:24.760" style="s2">just like the consumer ones are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.940" end="00:36:27.070" style="s2">good at making the workers lives right</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.760" end="00:36:29.470" style="s2">like they care about health Karen and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.070" end="00:36:31.570" style="s2">pain the entire supply chain either/or</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.470" end="00:36:34.360" style="s2">is way better than what we have but a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.570" end="00:36:37.030" style="s2">consumer cooperative isn&#39;t about profit</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.360" end="00:36:38.170" style="s2">it&#39;s about purpose right it&#39;s about neck</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.030" end="00:36:39.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you guys I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.170" end="00:36:41.350" style="s2">you guys have neck in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.370" end="00:36:42.850" style="s2">not equipment cloth it was a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.350" end="00:36:44.080" style="s2">that started here but it&#39;s consumer</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.850" end="00:36:45.070" style="s2">cooperatives so in order to shop there</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.080" end="00:36:46.870" style="s2">you have to pay five bucks</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.070" end="00:36:50.110" style="s2">they have a lot of problems because</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.870" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">their game a so we do vote to make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.110" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">good supply chamber than the stuffs</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:54.310" style="s2">overpriced people just walk down this to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.410" style="s2">like you don&#39;t even I&#39;m a member there</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.310" end="00:36:57.430" style="s2">but if you&#39;re fifty bucks extra for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.410" end="00:36:59.560" style="s2">pair of shoes I&#39;m gonna go to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.430" end="00:37:01.060" style="s2">competitor I don&#39;t you know I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.560" end="00:37:02.890" style="s2">I still have to make that decision but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.060" end="00:37:05.380" style="s2">if it was truly consumer cooperative or</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.890" end="00:37:08.170" style="s2">we could figure out right I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.380" end="00:37:09.670" style="s2">you I&#39;m going to the competitor I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.170" end="00:37:12.250" style="s2">not allowed to go to the competitor but</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.670" end="00:37:14.710" style="s2">I&#39;m like listen it&#39;s 50 bucks cheaper we</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.250" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">need to figure out this profit thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.710" end="00:37:19.240" style="s2">right we need to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:21.240" style="s2">ethically make stuff and get it at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.240" end="00:37:24.790" style="s2">price that I can afford right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.240" end="00:37:25.870" style="s2">not for profit because profit the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:27.880" style="s2">supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.870" end="00:37:29.109" style="s2">everyone needing to get profit is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.880" end="00:37:31.450" style="s2">makes they</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.109" end="00:37:33.249" style="s2">astronomically expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.450" end="00:37:34.779" style="s2">astronomically cheap right because then</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.249" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">the regulations and the subsidies and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.779" end="00:37:41.009" style="s2">like the cost is offloaded to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:48.970" style="s2">workers and extracted for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.009" end="00:37:50.920" style="s2">shareholders right yeah I&#39;m I think this</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.970" end="00:37:55.299" style="s2">is a really interesting Avenue of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.920" end="00:37:59.380" style="s2">discussion because I find sometimes just</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.299" end="00:38:00.670" style="s2">as with the word just as what we were</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.980" end="00:38:13.109" style="s2">same thing when we say it I tend to want</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.289" end="00:38:16.630" style="s2">to do that with the word capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.109" end="00:38:20.230" style="s2">because I might make the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.630" end="00:38:26.170" style="s2">between crony capitalism and capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.230" end="00:38:27.339" style="s2">while others might not for me it might</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.170" end="00:38:29.289" style="s2">be easier just to take the word</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.339" end="00:38:33.999" style="s2">capitalism out of the equation and put</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.289" end="00:38:37.720" style="s2">it as markets yeah we&#39;re at where you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.999" end="00:38:39.759" style="s2">don&#39;t have where you do have private</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.380" end="00:38:48.609" style="s2">less and less interested in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.109" end="00:38:50.380" style="s2">intellectual property rights I think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.609" end="00:38:51.970" style="s2">and I agree on this this is a way for</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.380" end="00:38:54.430" style="s2">people to establish cartels and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.970" end="00:38:57.759" style="s2">monopolies through the patent system and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.430" end="00:38:59.079" style="s2">I don&#39;t I agree with less and less that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.759" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">everyday now there&#39;s some compelling</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.079" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">arguments for why you would want a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:07.779" style="s2">patent system but I generally am finding</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:10.660" style="s2">these these arguments less compelling</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.779" end="00:39:12.130" style="s2">and I think that the social upside to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.660" end="00:39:15.369" style="s2">getting rid of these kind of patent</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.130" end="00:39:20.799" style="s2">regimes is probably stronger</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.369" end="00:39:23.380" style="s2">that being said I&#39;m still a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.799" end="00:39:27.670" style="s2">in the sense that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.380" end="00:39:33.099" style="s2">any that they&#39;re you know if capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.670" end="00:39:34.809" style="s2">is defined as creative trading trading</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.099" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">something that you own whether that be</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.809" end="00:39:42.210" style="s2">your labor or your your a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:45.780" style="s2">production good for or an experience or</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.210" end="00:39:48.660" style="s2">whatever for mutual benefit then I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.780" end="00:39:50.040" style="s2">capitalist and I think and I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.660" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">if that&#39;s the definition you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.040" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">probably agree I think what we both find</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:58.700" style="s2">objectionable about capitalism today is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:40:02.010" style="s2">it the corporate form as it&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.700" end="00:40:06.270" style="s2">sort of in the books is too extractive</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.010" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">too top-heavy tends to create you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.270" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">massive hierarchies where does it both</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:16.290" style="s2">decision make too much decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">power and too much of the gross revenues</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.290" end="00:40:22.890" style="s2">go to the top and that and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:25.500" style="s2">alternative corporate forms I think if</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.890" end="00:40:26.940" style="s2">we can master them and start to use them</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.500" end="00:40:30.750" style="s2">will out-compete those hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.940" end="00:40:33.869" style="s2">forms simply because the something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.750" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">is a system is more whole onic or more</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.869" end="00:40:40.740" style="s2">networked is likely to be able to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">more readily to the Gaels of creative</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:47.460" style="s2">destruction than other forms and I so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:49.080" style="s2">I&#39;m saying when about game B in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.460" end="00:40:50.760" style="s2">sense that once we move to these</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.080" end="00:40:52.920" style="s2">alternative forms and they send the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.760" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">hierarchical firms and their old legal</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.920" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">structures start to fall away these new</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.310" style="s2">forms will be ascendant that is my hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:00.780" style="s2">but that remains to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.310" end="00:41:05.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of promising work in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.780" end="00:41:07.710" style="s2">way there&#39;s a bunch of guys who found it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.550" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">like Brian Robertson who founded</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.710" end="00:41:11.670" style="s2">holacracy one with a guy named Tom</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:13.980" style="s2">Thomason these guys are great they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.670" end="00:41:16.440" style="s2">doing exceptional work on both the legal</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.980" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">frameworks for these kind of cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.440" end="00:41:20.550" style="s2">structures as well as developing</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:23.790" style="s2">internally whole onic systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.550" end="00:41:25.710" style="s2">not hierarchical that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.790" end="00:41:28.260" style="s2">amazing stuff and Jolla Craddock</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:30.570" style="s2">organizations are powerful and scalable</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.260" end="00:41:34.770" style="s2">I think holacracy could scale to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.570" end="00:41:35.970" style="s2">level of society which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.770" end="00:41:38.520" style="s2">that a lot of people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.970" end="00:41:41.220" style="s2">admit who practice so Locke recei but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.520" end="00:41:43.260" style="s2">think that that that is one model that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.220" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">could scale and and eventually replace</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:49.290" style="s2">democracy or the Democratic Republic I</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">would like to see that by a video like</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.290" end="00:41:53.580" style="s2">this is the whole cola kradic is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:54.300" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in like just how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.580" end="00:41:56.490" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.300" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">govern something for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.490" end="00:42:01.020" style="s2">word without hierarchy when currently we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">kind of need hierarchy because the tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.020" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t here right like the holo chain</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:07.410" style="s2">decentralized space to me also isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.000" style="s2">except like I said technical like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.410" end="00:42:11.220" style="s2">intellectually not accessible because</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.000" end="00:42:13.380" style="s2">I&#39;m non-consecutive I&#39;m the same time</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.220" end="00:42:15.780" style="s2">I&#39;m sure the concept of falak a holo</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.380" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">kradic would be accessible to me so is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.780" end="00:42:18.900" style="s2">there a way to learn about it without</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:21.000" style="s2">waiting for them to create the product</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.900" end="00:42:22.440" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t because they also own a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.000" end="00:42:24.570" style="s2">mean like it&#39;s such a long time between</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.440" end="00:42:25.800" style="s2">I have an idea didn&#39;t create this and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.570" end="00:42:27.240" style="s2">them actually creating and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.800" end="00:42:30.360" style="s2">out there and I can&#39;t participate in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.240" end="00:42:32.190" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s kind of part of that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.360" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">gonna use the term management loosely</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:39.470" style="s2">but holacracy is a management philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:44.040" style="s2">or framework it is it is instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.470" end="00:42:45.600" style="s2">more effectively with technology but</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.040" end="00:42:47.580" style="s2">it&#39;s simple technology is nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.600" end="00:42:49.830" style="s2">blockchain and oriented or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.580" end="00:42:51.000" style="s2">that yet now it may get supercharged by</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.830" end="00:42:53.190" style="s2">something like that in the future but</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.000" end="00:42:55.620" style="s2">right now they use a simple web app</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.190" end="00:42:57.540" style="s2">called glass frog to instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.620" end="00:43:00.840" style="s2">holacracy and it&#39;s just a way of really</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.540" end="00:43:02.250" style="s2">logging the the roles in circles what</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.840" end="00:43:07.070" style="s2">they call rules and circles in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.250" end="00:43:07.070" style="s2">organization so basically you have these</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">I can just give you a quick a quick</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.780" end="00:43:14.280" style="s2">sketch of the way holacracy works they</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:17.670" style="s2">essentially have two basic part they</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.280" end="00:43:21.090" style="s2">have a constitution which designates the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.670" end="00:43:26.310" style="s2">the overall architecture of how</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.090" end="00:43:29.640" style="s2">decisions are made and ensures that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.310" end="00:43:31.800" style="s2">there&#39;s some fundamental charter to an</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.640" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">organization that you adopt okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.800" end="00:43:36.620" style="s2">adopt the holacracy constitution once</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:39.930" style="s2">you do that you&#39;re basically agreeing to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.620" end="00:43:41.340" style="s2">to give your power over as any given</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.930" end="00:43:45.350" style="s2">employee whether the founder or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.340" end="00:43:48.780" style="s2">frontline to the system and instead you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.350" end="00:43:51.060" style="s2">adopt roles that are suitable to your</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.780" end="00:43:55.860" style="s2">skills and talents and remuneration is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.060" end="00:43:59.130" style="s2">not equal that it it pretty much flows</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.860" end="00:44:01.050" style="s2">to how much value you create in service</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.130" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">of the mission so any Jolla Craddock</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.050" end="00:44:04.980" style="s2">organization has to have a mission of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:07.800" style="s2">course society doesn&#39;t have a mission</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.980" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">but but any given</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.800" end="00:44:11.550" style="s2">hold on in society might have a mission</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:14.940" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.550" end="00:44:18.540" style="s2">keep keep this landmass safe might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.940" end="00:44:21.180" style="s2">one of them or whatever so the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.540" end="00:44:23.610" style="s2">whole onic nature of this system meaning</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.180" end="00:44:26.370" style="s2">the the circles that the team activities</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.610" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">are governed by processes two basic</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.370" end="00:44:31.110" style="s2">processes tactical and governance</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.490" style="s2">tactical are the decision the day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.110" end="00:44:34.410" style="s2">decisions that are one-off and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:36.870" style="s2">governance are the policies procedures</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.410" end="00:44:38.730" style="s2">and roles that are established for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.870" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">entire organization but these are</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.730" end="00:44:44.700" style="s2">constantly processing tensions between</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.350" end="00:44:53.220" style="s2">happening from without so it functions</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:56.430" style="s2">like an organism and the organism is</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.830" end="00:45:13.800" style="s2">is not going to be relevant to some</p>

<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:21.930" style="s2">a tension that they want proc process so</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.150" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">reason for the holo in both of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.890" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">systems is that comes from whole on or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:49.860" style="s2">holistic system that has nested</p>

<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:45:59.970" style="s2">the buck or doing what you&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.350" end="00:46:03.120" style="s2">because that&#39;s what your job description</p>

<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:26.670" style="s2">so you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.050" end="00:46:29.250" style="s2">at what needs to be changed head-on</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.670" end="00:46:31.170" style="s2">rather than avoiding it is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.250" end="00:46:32.370" style="s2">like this is all in its infancy so the</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.370" end="00:46:37.050" style="s2">right like they don&#39;t like this exists</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.460" end="00:46:45.930" style="s2">expensive is it expensive to use the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.320" end="00:46:47.730" style="s2">technology I&#39;m guessing over no glass</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.930" end="00:46:49.860" style="s2">frog is there in fact there are free</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.730" end="00:46:52.110" style="s2">versions of glass frog out there I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.860" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">there might not be glass frog but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.110" end="00:46:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s really cheap they&#39;ve just developed</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:47:01.140" style="s2">sophisticated technology it simply</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.050" end="00:47:04.110" style="s2">tracks the roles and the policies so</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.140" end="00:47:06.270" style="s2">that people can easily look up who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.110" end="00:47:10.020" style="s2">responsible for what and coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.270" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">collaborate easily it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.020" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">of like a secretarial function in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:16.770" style="s2">of ways you know there&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.770" end="00:47:21.240" style="s2">and there then there&#39;s also okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.890" style="s2">wanted there&#39;s something I&#39;m a process</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.240" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">attention that has to do with marketing</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.890" end="00:47:27.930" style="s2">the marketing function which you can see</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:31.110" style="s2">is like an organ in an organism or a</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.930" end="00:47:33.030" style="s2">part of the ecosystem so I see who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.110" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">responsible for what and what policies</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.030" end="00:47:37.530" style="s2">are constraining them before I ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:40.370" style="s2">reach out to them I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.530" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">I&#39;m quipped with knowledge that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.370" end="00:47:44.040" style="s2">having to deal with in the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:46.290" style="s2">constraints they&#39;re having to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.040" end="00:47:48.120" style="s2">and if we want to make changes to those</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.290" end="00:47:52.020" style="s2">rules and constraints we can do so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.120" end="00:47:54.150" style="s2">collaboratively as long as and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.020" end="00:47:57.330" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of like meta rules involved</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.150" end="00:48:00.510" style="s2">in this as long as it doesn&#39;t obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.330" end="00:48:03.330" style="s2">threaten the organization to do so right</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.510" end="00:48:05.820" style="s2">so everything can anything can be tried</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.330" end="00:48:08.220" style="s2">anything can be iterated on but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.820" end="00:48:09.720" style="s2">a process for ensuring that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.220" end="00:48:13.910" style="s2">catastrophic harm that can come to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.720" end="00:48:18.300" style="s2">organization by changing some policy or</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.910" end="00:48:20.070" style="s2">doing taking some tactical action anyway</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.300" end="00:48:22.740" style="s2">I&#39;m getting in the weeds about holacracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.070" end="00:48:25.740" style="s2">but suffice it to say there is no there</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.740" end="00:48:27.720" style="s2">is no hierarchy there is no boss</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.740" end="00:48:28.980" style="s2">bosses are eliminated everything is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.720" end="00:48:31.530" style="s2">about roles everything is about</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.980" end="00:48:34.600" style="s2">competencies what you&#39;re good at what</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.530" end="00:48:38.070" style="s2">your school is supposed to work on and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.600" end="00:48:41.230" style="s2">it really does keep knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.070" end="00:48:43.840" style="s2">decisions more highly localized rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.230" end="00:48:46.450" style="s2">than up and down chains of command where</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.840" end="00:48:50.050" style="s2">you have a whole layer of middle</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.450" end="00:48:53.890" style="s2">management that is interpreting the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.050" end="00:48:55.600" style="s2">stuff from the higher-ups and then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.890" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">know trying to process feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.600" end="00:49:00.250" style="s2">assign tasks to the rank-and-file that</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.250" end="00:49:03.340" style="s2">time but it&#39;s outlived its usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.660" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s no longer sustainable the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.340" end="00:49:09.550" style="s2">world&#39;s just too complex so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:11.110" style="s2">Venn diagram I work with just in like</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.550" end="00:49:12.670" style="s2">what I&#39;m he&#39;s like this is how things</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.110" end="00:49:15.610" style="s2">get done it&#39;s like in order for an</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.670" end="00:49:17.710" style="s2">activity to get done you know enemy you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.610" end="00:49:19.600" style="s2">know potholes get filled a marketing</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.710" end="00:49:22.180" style="s2">campaign to be done you need three</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.600" end="00:49:23.800" style="s2">things to happen simultaneously one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:25.480" style="s2">which game a doesn&#39;t play they just pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.800" end="00:49:28.030" style="s2">you to do it and the other ones it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.480" end="00:49:29.710" style="s2">that you need to like want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.030" end="00:49:31.210" style="s2">task you have a desire to do it they</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.710" end="00:49:33.160" style="s2">just over compensate that by paying you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.210" end="00:49:35.140" style="s2">right but you never actually get to what</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.160" end="00:49:36.700" style="s2">I call the sweet spot you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.140" end="00:49:37.900" style="s2">the skills to complete the penthouse you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.700" end="00:49:40.260" style="s2">just actually know you just need to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.900" end="00:49:43.060" style="s2">aware the task needs to get done and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.260" end="00:49:45.100" style="s2">there&#39;s just a compensation between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.060" end="00:49:47.410" style="s2">three like I just wrote this out now</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.100" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">like if you&#39;re I can&#39;t do this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.410" end="00:49:50.140" style="s2">backwards if you&#39;re here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:51.820" style="s2">everything gets done you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:54.760" style="s2">pay people it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.820" end="00:49:57.130" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way to compensate our game</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.760" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">aid compensates for not wanting to by</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.130" end="00:50:00.700" style="s2">paying it right if you&#39;re just off error</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:02.650" style="s2">technology&#39;s really easy to get you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.700" end="00:50:05.350" style="s2">aware there&#39;s the task to fill right</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.650" end="00:50:09.580" style="s2">then if I can so my question is within</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.350" end="00:50:12.100" style="s2">the holacracy is part of my problem in</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.580" end="00:50:13.840" style="s2">just in the world personally is that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.100" end="00:50:15.940" style="s2">never seem to fulfill the world like</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.840" end="00:50:17.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a Job Description right the role</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.940" end="00:50:19.960" style="s2">and you have to be able to have be all</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.770" end="00:50:21.550" style="s2">of these competencies I have four of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.960" end="00:50:23.650" style="s2">them and not the other four I do this</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.550" end="00:50:25.870" style="s2">for amazing and this for like crap right</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.650" end="00:50:28.630" style="s2">and so I can&#39;t take the role because I</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.870" end="00:50:30.940" style="s2">can&#39;t I can do these can I just take</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.630" end="00:50:32.170" style="s2">that can I just take like how do but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.940" end="00:50:34.330" style="s2">might be really awesome and finding</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.170" end="00:50:36.010" style="s2">tasks for other people to do right like</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.160" end="00:50:44.650" style="s2">the whole idea properly let alone do the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:47.860" style="s2">coding the decision-making any of it all</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.650" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">up myself and so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.860" end="00:50:49.869" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:52.869" style="s2">is there a way to deal with this on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.869" end="00:50:56.170" style="s2">system of like yes I okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.869" end="00:50:57.940" style="s2">it&#39;s um that the I won&#39;t go into too</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.170" end="00:50:59.710" style="s2">much detail there&#39;s a role called delete</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.940" end="00:51:02.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a like a meta role a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.710" end="00:51:04.420" style="s2">constitutional role for each circle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.380" end="00:51:07.769" style="s2">called a lead link and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.079" end="00:51:26.710" style="s2">it yet so let me get some training first</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.849" end="00:51:29.799" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll take that role on right</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.710" end="00:51:32.019" style="s2">the lead link is responsible for being</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.799" end="00:51:33.880" style="s2">the eyes of the circle to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.019" end="00:51:35.799" style="s2">the the needs of the circle are right</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.880" end="00:51:37.539" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have that someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.799" end="00:51:38.920" style="s2">keeping their eye on the horizon the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.539" end="00:51:41.230" style="s2">relationships to other circles in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.920" end="00:51:44.200" style="s2">organization work or the needs of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.230" end="00:51:47.009" style="s2">whole on that the whole LAN will suffer</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.200" end="00:51:48.490" style="s2">the circle the team will suffer in their</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.009" end="00:51:51.670" style="s2">responsibilities but yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.490" end="00:51:55.029" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the way they do it and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.670" end="00:51:56.619" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s really about constant</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.029" end="00:51:58.809" style="s2">communication and collaboration to fill</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.619" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">roles and if they they can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.809" end="00:52:02.589" style="s2">someone to fill a role especially a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:06.579" style="s2">vital role within the organization</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.589" end="00:52:09.279" style="s2">that&#39;s how they hire and and so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.579" end="00:52:11.529" style="s2">think of these roles as these you might</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.279" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">have anywhere from five to ten of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.529" end="00:52:16.930" style="s2">major responsibilities they call roles</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:19.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re involved in so you might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.930" end="00:52:24.390" style="s2">a member of different circles different</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.480" end="00:52:26.950" style="s2">öhlins because your roles are so varied</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.390" end="00:52:29.049" style="s2">right so you the kind of person that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.950" end="00:52:31.480" style="s2">yeah I heard you described is like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.049" end="00:52:34.420" style="s2">is this is this kind of hierarchy obtuse</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.480" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">job description that&#39;s very rigid yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.420" end="00:52:38.259" style="s2">you&#39;re like yeah I can do for these the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">other four not so much most people just</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.259" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">say I&#39;ll figure it out on the job I got</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:43.779" style="s2">I got to eat I got to pay my family so</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:46.900" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna figure out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.779" end="00:52:50.289" style="s2">ya know spreadsheet you know or</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.900" end="00:52:51.940" style="s2">whatever which is what I would do in</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.289" end="00:52:53.829" style="s2">that circumstance is like okay I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:54.970" style="s2">really good at spreadsheets but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.829" end="00:52:56.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing I got to do a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.970" end="00:52:59.559" style="s2">rapid learning curve on I&#39;ll figure it</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.680" end="00:53:01.390" style="s2">out fast and I might just they might</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.559" end="00:53:02.210" style="s2">find out four months into it that wow</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.390" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">this guy really</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.210" end="00:53:06.200" style="s2">suck at spreadsheets hopefully they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:07.820" style="s2">won&#39;t fire me but in holic recei you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:11.540" style="s2">processing that tension from moment to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.820" end="00:53:15.530" style="s2">moment okay yeah so like you&#39;re also so</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.540" end="00:53:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s also a process of like this feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.530" end="00:53:18.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel like I can do the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.210" end="00:53:21.020" style="s2">spreadsheet right now like it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.620" end="00:53:22.850" style="s2">mental and emotional piece of it because</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.020" end="00:53:24.140" style="s2">you know that you can get help so that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.850" end="00:53:25.190" style="s2">think that&#39;s a big part of it too right</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.140" end="00:53:26.930" style="s2">like cuz you don&#39;t want to go to your</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.190" end="00:53:28.940" style="s2">boss and the other circumstance your</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.930" end="00:53:31.730" style="s2">boss and be like I don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.940" end="00:53:32.690" style="s2">spreadsheets you hired me to do you see</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.730" end="00:53:33.740" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna try it to the best your</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.690" end="00:53:36.320" style="s2">ability and you&#39;re not gonna be the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.740" end="00:53:37.610" style="s2">at it first is I don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.320" end="00:53:38.990" style="s2">spreadsheets I don&#39;t want to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.610" end="00:53:40.340" style="s2">to do spreadsheets someone else needs to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.990" end="00:53:41.750" style="s2">take on that spreadsheet and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.340" end="00:53:43.400" style="s2">someone else to take on if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.750" end="00:53:44.200" style="s2">then you hire someone with laziness</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.400" end="00:53:47.600" style="s2">spreadsheets</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.200" end="00:53:50.690" style="s2">yeah and hopefully holacracy is robust</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.600" end="00:53:52.550" style="s2">enough to - before you ever get into a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.690" end="00:53:55.430" style="s2">role of doing spreadsheets that you say</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.550" end="00:53:57.110" style="s2">this is not my jam right you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.430" end="00:53:59.390" style="s2">only dealing with a constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.110" end="00:54:01.820" style="s2">rules that you&#39;re suitable to and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.390" end="00:54:05.540" style="s2">to some degree you can at least tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.820" end="00:54:07.100" style="s2">doing if not have passion for so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.540" end="00:54:09.620" style="s2">yeah I would encourage you to look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.100" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">the book holacracy by Ryan Robertson and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.620" end="00:54:15.770" style="s2">you may find and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:18.260" style="s2">really um a technology driven thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.770" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">although glass frog is quite useful you</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.260" end="00:54:23.330" style="s2">can apply holacracy without using glass</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:25.130" style="s2">frog it would just be a little unwieldy</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.330" end="00:54:26.810" style="s2">and it would be harder with a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.130" end="00:54:28.730" style="s2">distributed team you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.810" end="00:54:30.650" style="s2">were you&#39;re in Vancouver I&#39;m in Austin</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.730" end="00:54:32.750" style="s2">you know it would be a little a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.650" end="00:54:34.220" style="s2">more difficult you know you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.750" end="00:54:35.960" style="s2">use Google Docs and things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.220" end="00:54:38.650" style="s2">get it get out of control pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.960" end="00:54:41.360" style="s2">glass frog just helps you manage those</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.650" end="00:54:43.160" style="s2">processes and decisions but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.360" end="00:54:46.430" style="s2">otherwise do very much of anything else</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.160" end="00:54:48.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like a you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.430" end="00:54:50.330" style="s2">some incentives based blockchain thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.650" end="00:54:50.930" style="s2">where it&#39;s tokenized and this and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.330" end="00:54:55.660" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.930" end="00:55:00.940" style="s2">in fact they they kind of resist</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.660" end="00:55:03.890" style="s2">incentives based thinking in Halak recei</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.940" end="00:55:06.410" style="s2">but i mean i&#39;m in alignment with but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.890" end="00:55:10.070" style="s2">can see by like that&#39;s where true their</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.410" end="00:55:12.290" style="s2">technology needs to be diverse like one</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.070" end="00:55:15.080" style="s2">central pot of technology so that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.290" end="00:55:15.620" style="s2">data is centralized not centralized on</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.080" end="00:55:17.510" style="s2">one server</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.620" end="00:55:21.100" style="s2">but centralizes and anyone can use it</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.510" end="00:55:24.100" style="s2">but look at ya and you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.100" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">he&#39;s like what I want to do is create a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.100" end="00:55:28.340" style="s2">collaboration platform right that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:32.150" style="s2">able to either you&#39;re able to bring your</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.340" end="00:55:33.560" style="s2">project to or which has been done this</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.150" end="00:55:35.570" style="s2">is not new things right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.560" end="00:55:37.790" style="s2">like eight people in the game bSpace</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.570" end="00:55:40.820" style="s2">creating what is really a clatters I</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.790" end="00:55:45.320" style="s2">mean I was just doing it up to the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.820" end="00:55:46.760" style="s2">week Dow stacks you know non blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.320" end="00:55:48.800" style="s2">or non distributed ledger based</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.760" end="00:55:52.420" style="s2">collaborative platforms that have</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.800" end="00:55:55.130" style="s2">incentives and winnowing and voting and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.420" end="00:55:57.800" style="s2">some people hate voting I I developed a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.130" end="00:56:00.320" style="s2">with with other people a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.800" end="00:56:02.660" style="s2">voting system but only did it because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.320" end="00:56:04.280" style="s2">had to because you had to have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.660" end="00:56:06.650" style="s2">collective decision-making mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.280" end="00:56:09.230" style="s2">that was superior to 50% plus one</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.650" end="00:56:11.180" style="s2">because I couldn&#39;t use other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.230" end="00:56:14.750" style="s2">collective decision-making that are not</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.180" end="00:56:16.370" style="s2">democratic long story but these are</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.750" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">these are kinds of things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.370" end="00:56:20.380" style="s2">really at pushing at the edge of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:23.230" style="s2">possible with collective decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.380" end="00:56:26.270" style="s2">for example dominant assurance contracts</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.230" end="00:56:30.140" style="s2">assurance contracts these are ways that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.270" end="00:56:32.930" style="s2">like an assurance contract is is what</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.140" end="00:56:36.440" style="s2">they you know like Kickstarter uses if</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.930" end="00:56:39.170" style="s2">so many people agree to the to put in</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.440" end="00:56:42.440" style="s2">this minimum amount then the decision</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.170" end="00:56:44.510" style="s2">gets made right that kind it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.440" end="00:56:50.300" style="s2">not a voting system per se it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.510" end="00:56:52.460" style="s2">voluntary system a way of privately its</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.300" end="00:56:54.770" style="s2">private provision of public goods if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.460" end="00:56:58.010" style="s2">like that and those kinds of systems are</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.770" end="00:57:00.290" style="s2">going to be coming online left and right</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.010" end="00:57:02.390" style="s2">we need them to be competitive we want</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.290" end="00:57:05.960" style="s2">yours to be the best so that I can join</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.390" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">yours and we&#39;re yes which is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.960" end="00:57:11.360" style="s2">right if I can join if we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:12.770" style="s2">competition and then one wins like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.360" end="00:57:14.270" style="s2">winning has to be that the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.770" end="00:57:16.130" style="s2">can come on board to it right the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.270" end="00:57:17.540" style="s2">can come on board to it and then like</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.130" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">things that were good about the old one</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.540" end="00:57:22.430" style="s2">can come on board to this one and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:25.130" style="s2">to me is having one collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.430" end="00:57:27.050" style="s2">platform which is I don&#39;t have one I</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.130" end="00:57:29.230" style="s2">don&#39;t not coder right I can&#39;t code this</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.050" end="00:57:31.000" style="s2"> so I don&#39;t have one just like</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.230" end="00:57:32.950" style="s2">for people it&#39;s not in the process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.000" end="00:57:36.040" style="s2">like how do we work through the process</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.950" end="00:57:37.720" style="s2">of creating something together and why</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.040" end="00:57:40.270" style="s2">creating the technology that&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.720" end="00:57:41.530" style="s2">for creating something together and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.270" end="00:57:42.850" style="s2">following that protocol whenever it</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.530" end="00:57:45.370" style="s2">breaks down because it&#39;s gonna break</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.850" end="00:57:46.780" style="s2">down not just in the codeine which of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.370" end="00:57:49.360" style="s2">course that&#39;s up to the tech people this</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.780" end="00:57:50.860" style="s2">all right like this crashed but like it</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.360" end="00:57:52.390" style="s2">breaks down emotionally it breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.860" end="00:57:54.370" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t figure this piece out</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.390" end="00:57:56.110" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t have this tool you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.370" end="00:57:58.180" style="s2">created into the next iteration right</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.110" end="00:58:01.150" style="s2">and you prioritize what the best piece</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.180" end="00:58:02.710" style="s2">is instead of just one group saying this</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.150" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">is my vision of what collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.710" end="00:58:06.760" style="s2">platforms should look like what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.110" style="s2">vision of what a collaboration platform</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.760" end="00:58:09.880" style="s2">should look like and then let&#39;s make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.110" end="00:58:11.770" style="s2">and let&#39;s make it beta so that it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.880" end="00:58:13.420" style="s2">know Naveen like and then what is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.770" end="00:58:15.160" style="s2">next piece and the next piece add on to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.420" end="00:58:17.380" style="s2">it so eventually there&#39;s one platform</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.160" end="00:58:20.410" style="s2">that does have all of the pieces so you</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.380" end="00:58:22.210" style="s2">can coordinate glass frog through time</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.410" end="00:58:23.800" style="s2">zones and global thing right because</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.210" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">it&#39;s always there&#39;s always this slightly</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.800" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">broken piece about every technology</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:29.650" style="s2">that&#39;s out there I&#39;m like an end because</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:31.540" style="s2">I&#39;m not a techy person figuring out one</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.650" end="00:58:33.670" style="s2">is hard good learning curve let alone</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:34.750" style="s2">figuring out not like these seven and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.670" end="00:58:37.360" style="s2">then how to coordinate them together</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.750" end="00:58:38.740" style="s2">right so yeah I mean I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.360" end="00:58:39.370" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna you&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.740" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">get there</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.370" end="00:58:45.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no gonna be no moment no</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:48.310" style="s2">apotheosis of all of the technological</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.010" end="00:58:50.290" style="s2">goodies in one system there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.310" end="00:58:53.620" style="s2">going to be a process of competition</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.290" end="00:58:55.540" style="s2">potential for defection and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.620" end="00:58:57.400" style="s2">successful ones are gonna have network</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.540" end="00:58:59.860" style="s2">effects Facebook is a great example of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.400" end="00:59:01.720" style="s2">network effects that have kept a certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.860" end="00:59:05.770" style="s2">kind of gravity I can&#39;t tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.720" end="00:59:07.960" style="s2">many people you are sitting on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.770" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">every day bitching about Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.960" end="00:59:13.720" style="s2">and how awful it is and like are you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:16.120" style="s2">aware of the irony here you know you</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.720" end="00:59:18.670" style="s2">spend more time using Facebook to bitch</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.120" end="00:59:20.200" style="s2">about Facebook and and yeah some</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.670" end="00:59:23.620" style="s2">perverse value in that I think that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.200" end="00:59:26.170" style="s2">get out of it but no I you know and I I</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.620" end="00:59:29.800" style="s2">but I do think that you&#39;re right in one</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.170" end="00:59:32.560" style="s2">sense you want to you want the the best</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.800" end="00:59:35.110" style="s2">features of the system that gets out</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.560" end="00:59:37.660" style="s2">competed to somehow be assimilated I</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.110" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">think with open source and platform</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.660" end="00:59:42.970" style="s2">cooperatives and you know these the some</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:46.569" style="s2">to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.970" end="00:59:49.140" style="s2">just dissolution of the IPE cartel</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.569" end="00:59:54.130" style="s2">system will allow for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.140" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">constant process of overcoming entropy</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.130" end="01:00:03.010" style="s2">with emergence and we may have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:06.310" style="s2">operate in some legal gray areas to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.010" end="01:00:08.109" style="s2">some of this stuff yeah and rare yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.310" end="01:00:09.579" style="s2">it&#39;s the part robe like I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.109" end="01:00:11.230" style="s2">the co-operative model is the place to</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.579" end="01:00:12.670" style="s2">play with that but it gets to the place</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.230" end="01:00:14.530" style="s2">right if you have 10 million people in</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.670" end="01:00:16.150" style="s2">your cooperative it&#39;s actually not that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.530" end="01:00:17.829" style="s2">hard to break the patent system right</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.150" end="01:00:19.480" style="s2">like if we okay 10 million people maybe</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.829" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">not a billion people you can break the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.480" end="01:00:25.420" style="s2">patent system and in a legal way right</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">we were like we aren&#39;t just lobbyists</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.420" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">and going toward the government we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:31.540" style="s2">your constituents that are like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.160" style="s2">want that anymore passing laws to undo</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.540" end="01:00:34.780" style="s2">it right like the obviou opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.160" end="01:00:36.460" style="s2">lobbyism but that means you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.780" end="01:00:38.349" style="s2">get people to agree on it right and even</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.460" end="01:00:41.940" style="s2">we can see the positive and negative of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.349" end="01:00:44.349" style="s2">the intellectual property the patents so</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.940" end="01:00:47.319" style="s2">not everyone&#39;s gonna want to be on board</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.349" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s partly that but I do think</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.319" end="01:00:51.940" style="s2">that or I wouldn&#39;t be doing it that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">there is a space like you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.940" end="01:00:55.930" style="s2">everything to everyone if you have your</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:57.880" style="s2">own individual project you&#39;re only gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.930" end="01:00:59.650" style="s2">design it for you or for a specific</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.880" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">group of people that you think needs it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.650" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">and so if it doesn&#39;t make someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:05.920" style="s2">needs game a capitalism the market is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:07.150" style="s2">like rice you create a competing product</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.920" end="01:01:08.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a no-brainer and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.150" end="01:01:10.690" style="s2">hopefully mine&#39;s better but the issue is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.980" end="01:01:12.579" style="s2">one it&#39;s dissipated so the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.690" end="01:01:14.170" style="s2">this one needs $50,000 a month to stay</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.579" end="01:01:14.410" style="s2">in business and this one needs $50,000 a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.170" end="01:01:15.880" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.410" end="01:01:17.740" style="s2">are there enough customers out there for</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.880" end="01:01:19.390" style="s2">that like that is a piece of tech to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.740" end="01:01:20.920" style="s2">that&#39;s broken is they seem to price it</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.390" end="01:01:24.069" style="s2">at the point where they need it to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.920" end="01:01:26.200" style="s2">just keep it in business and profitable</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.069" end="01:01:27.910" style="s2">but of course but they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.200" end="01:01:29.710" style="s2">price it at the point people want to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.910" end="01:01:32.230" style="s2">it right they don&#39;t actually make me</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.710" end="01:01:34.089" style="s2">supply meet demand they&#39;re like it cost</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.230" end="01:01:36.220" style="s2">$50,000 to keep our servers so we need</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.089" end="01:01:37.900" style="s2">$50,000 we have 50,000 customers don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.220" end="01:01:39.310" style="s2">needs to be $1.00 per month we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.900" end="01:01:41.109" style="s2">good I mean they&#39;re gonna go out</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.310" end="01:01:42.190" style="s2">weirdness if they don&#39;t price it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.109" end="01:01:44.770" style="s2">according to the supply and demand</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.190" end="01:01:46.930" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do they do all go out of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.770" end="01:01:49.089" style="s2">business that&#39;s like everything costs 10</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.930" end="01:01:50.950" style="s2">dollars a month per person I&#39;m like but</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.089" end="01:01:52.089" style="s2">and everyone has to keep the lights on</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.950" end="01:01:53.680" style="s2">and everyone needs an HR department</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.089" end="01:01:55.990" style="s2">everyone needs a legal department unless</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:56.300" style="s2">they&#39;re participating you know it wants</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.990" end="01:01:58.610" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.300" end="01:02:00.710" style="s2">yes so like the more were able to come</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.610" end="01:02:02.780" style="s2">together and create like you have your</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.710" end="01:02:04.190" style="s2">own individual project but you can use</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.780" end="01:02:05.360" style="s2">our HR department or our legal</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.190" end="01:02:08.360" style="s2">department or whatever it is where there</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.360" end="01:02:10.100" style="s2">is this centralized entity that&#39;s fee</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.360" end="01:02:11.720" style="s2">that&#39;s helping you writing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.100" end="01:02:13.310" style="s2">helping it and it&#39;s it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.720" end="01:02:14.540" style="s2">hierarchy down it&#39;s not like you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.310" end="01:02:16.490" style="s2">follow this but hey there are these</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.540" end="01:02:18.050" style="s2">there are these tools and in that way</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.490" end="01:02:21.560" style="s2">instead of like if we have one product</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.050" end="01:02:24.050" style="s2">ie one platform that&#39;s designed for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.560" end="01:02:27.320" style="s2">product like the young the mission right</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.050" end="01:02:28.880" style="s2">of like helping people collaborate what</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.320" end="01:02:29.930" style="s2">does that look like right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.880" end="01:02:35.150" style="s2">being able to have face-to-face</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.930" end="01:02:36.620" style="s2">conversations that are what&#39;s scheduled</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.150" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">right like how many people do you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.620" end="01:02:39.890" style="s2">to get together whether it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:41.270" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a project together and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.890" end="01:02:42.740" style="s2">need to be able to coordinate that or</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.270" end="01:02:43.970" style="s2">whether it&#39;s because I want to have this</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.740" end="01:02:46.220" style="s2">conversation with somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.970" end="01:02:48.500" style="s2">understands decentralization how do you</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.220" end="01:02:50.090" style="s2">coordinate that it&#39;s it&#39;s just bringing</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.500" end="01:02:51.230" style="s2">people together saying everything we</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.090" end="01:02:54.020" style="s2">would want in a collaboration platform</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.230" end="01:02:55.850" style="s2">which is impossible then picking the top</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.020" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">priority of what we want in it creating</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.850" end="01:02:58.670" style="s2">that and then seem that the next</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.080" style="s2">iteration next iteration is so</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.670" end="01:03:02.420" style="s2">eventually if there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">features there&#39;s a very beta this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.080" end="01:04:46.369" style="s2">very simple anyone on an iPad can use it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:47.869" style="s2">a five-year-old can use it someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.369" end="01:04:50.060" style="s2">never touched technology till they&#39;re 90</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.869" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">can use it this is the basic and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.060" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">you can add the plugins and part of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:54.859" style="s2">is having people who aren&#39;t techie being</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:56.450" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know how to do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.859" end="01:04:57.190" style="s2">don&#39;t they&#39;re not coordinating well</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.450" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.190" end="01:05:02.480" style="s2">technology is the thing that it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:04.220" style="s2">to it&#39;s more cost effective to have more</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:06.170" style="s2">diversity without breaking the like</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.220" end="01:05:07.400" style="s2">thing right like if we want one a dozen</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.170" end="01:05:10.580" style="s2">firms of ice cream</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.400" end="01:05:12.619" style="s2">we need a factory that makes a dozen</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.580" end="01:05:16.430" style="s2">forms of ice cream yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.619" end="01:05:20.450" style="s2">the the the heart the hyper the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.430" end="01:05:21.950" style="s2">collaborative environment of it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.450" end="01:05:23.660" style="s2">like a whole of chain is a good example</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.950" end="01:05:26.510" style="s2">of this their technology is</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.660" end="01:05:30.410" style="s2">fundamentally for Keable at every level</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.510" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">right so you can if I&#39;m not mistaken and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.410" end="01:05:35.720" style="s2">I could be miss speaking but uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:38.750" style="s2">Arthur Brock would would correct me but</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.720" end="01:05:41.210" style="s2">at some at some fundamental level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.750" end="01:05:44.510" style="s2">designed so that it&#39;s not it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.210" end="01:05:46.910" style="s2">just yours someone could easily take it</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.510" end="01:05:53.210" style="s2">and adapt it and do their own stuff with</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.910" end="01:05:56.990" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that it&#39;s made to be much</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.210" end="01:05:59.960" style="s2">more like a it they use biological</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.990" end="01:06:01.609" style="s2">metaphors frequently which I like but</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.960" end="01:06:05.690" style="s2">because of the nature of its its</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.609" end="01:06:08.930" style="s2">evolution and change it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.690" end="01:06:10.940" style="s2">designed for evolution and change and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.930" end="01:06:14.119" style="s2">not for anybody being able to squat on</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.940" end="01:06:15.260" style="s2">it and extract so that&#39;s pretty cool but</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.119" end="01:06:17.869" style="s2">it that means if there&#39;s hyper</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.260" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">competition and it could be hyper</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.869" end="01:06:25.030" style="s2">competition between two forks and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:28.210" style="s2">you know the I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.030" end="01:06:30.849" style="s2">heard of the this um this old Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.210" end="01:06:33.549" style="s2">he&#39;s dead now but his name is Albert</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.849" end="01:06:36.220" style="s2">Hirschman he came up with this book</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.549" end="01:06:38.410" style="s2">called exit voice in loyalty and exit</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.220" end="01:06:42.040" style="s2">voice in loyalty is essentially these</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.410" end="01:06:44.890" style="s2">these processes of this a human</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.040" end="01:06:47.470" style="s2">algorithm of social change you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.890" end="01:06:49.450" style="s2">accept a system let&#39;s say you know with</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.470" end="01:06:51.940" style="s2">voice you can try to change the system</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.450" end="01:06:53.349" style="s2">by expressing your opinion persuading</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.940" end="01:06:56.079" style="s2">others to change all that good stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.349" end="01:06:57.670" style="s2">that&#39;s voice and and if you can get</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.079" end="01:06:59.890" style="s2">enough people internally to agree with</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.670" end="01:07:03.579" style="s2">you something might change but if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.890" end="01:07:05.559" style="s2">can&#39;t you use exit right you you start</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.579" end="01:07:07.630" style="s2">out you you you you leave the system to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.559" end="01:07:09.460" style="s2">start a new system hopefully to attract</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.630" end="01:07:11.410" style="s2">new people to your system and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.460" end="01:07:12.849" style="s2">there&#39;s loyalty which is to say I</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.410" end="01:07:14.410" style="s2">couldn&#39;t change it I couldn&#39;t use voice</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.849" end="01:07:16.059" style="s2">or exit so I&#39;m gonna stick with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.410" end="01:07:17.829" style="s2">because I love these folks even though I</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.059" end="01:07:20.849" style="s2">think they&#39;re wrong headed right or</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.829" end="01:07:23.829" style="s2">whatever or by God even though this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.849" end="01:07:25.390" style="s2">you know this is trash whiskey I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.829" end="01:07:27.400" style="s2">continue to drink maker&#39;s mark even</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.390" end="01:07:29.380" style="s2">though they put in water in it now yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.400" end="01:07:32.250" style="s2">whatever just because I&#39;m loyal to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.380" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">brand but these phenomena sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.250" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">cascade out into society in pro-social</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:41.890" style="s2">ways and holo chain is one of those that</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:43.510" style="s2">that works that way leaves you the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.890" end="01:07:48.250" style="s2">opportunity to fork and try something</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.510" end="01:07:51.099" style="s2">new Italy and it doesn&#39;t and the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.250" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">of that is things are less extractive</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.099" end="01:07:55.059" style="s2">the systems are less extractive because</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.680" end="01:07:57.430" style="s2">it was always someone who can come</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.059" end="01:07:58.900" style="s2">around and do it who might have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.430" end="01:08:01.510" style="s2">different way of doing it might attract</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.900" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">a Nuke constituency around their version</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.510" end="01:08:06.040" style="s2">of the product and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:07.569" style="s2">probably healthy and I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.040" end="01:08:13.059" style="s2">our governance systems need more of</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.569" end="01:08:14.890" style="s2">frankly you know power to the provinces</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.059" end="01:08:17.529" style="s2">if you like in Canada make it more like</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.890" end="01:08:20.230" style="s2">the Swiss the Swiss have the can tones</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.529" end="01:08:23.739" style="s2">and the Canton&#39;s are much more empowered</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.230" end="01:08:25.750" style="s2">to make changes there they&#39;re sort of at</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.739" end="01:08:28.660" style="s2">parity with the federal government of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.750" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">Switzerland and I think that is I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.660" end="01:08:33.940" style="s2">for they have the best governance model</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:35.470" style="s2">in the world in my opinion and I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.940" end="01:08:37.750" style="s2">American and I love the US</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.470" end="01:08:39.610" style="s2">institution but US Constitution could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.750" end="01:08:43.240" style="s2">interpreted that way but it&#39;s not so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.610" end="01:08:46.800" style="s2">have a very top-heavy extractive kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.240" end="01:08:50.260" style="s2">state of affairs because of that and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.800" end="01:08:52.690" style="s2">you know the the the provinces in Canada</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.260" end="01:08:54.160" style="s2">are subordinated to the federal</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.690" end="01:08:57.400" style="s2">government to a very great degree I take</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.160" end="01:09:00.040" style="s2">it yeah I mean we got our funding and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.400" end="01:09:01.300" style="s2">get theirs like doing BC Alberta at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.040" end="01:09:04.450" style="s2">moment because we won&#39;t let them build a</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.300" end="01:09:04.840" style="s2">pipeline through province theirs yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.450" end="01:09:06.340" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.840" end="01:09:08.170" style="s2">then our Prime Minister bought the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.340" end="01:09:10.120" style="s2">pipelines so if he thinks we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.170" end="01:09:12.820" style="s2">it lots of fun lots of fun things</p>

<p begin="01:21:48.560" end="01:21:52.910" style="s2">to it too right you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.390" end="01:21:54.440" style="s2">people who use in and it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.910" end="01:21:55.249" style="s2">that blockchain is illegal in the United</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.249" end="01:22:00.860" style="s2">the kind of the umbrella of things that</p>

<p begin="01:22:17.059" end="01:22:20.690" style="s2">law you have to comply with so that</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:21.949" style="s2">that&#39;s going to take 250 thousand</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.690" end="01:22:25.039" style="s2">dollars right there just to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.949" end="01:22:26.239" style="s2">do that and I&#39;m you know the question of</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.039" end="01:22:28.369" style="s2">whether something is a security token</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.239" end="01:22:30.650" style="s2">versus a utility token and utility</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.369" end="01:22:33.019" style="s2">tokens are now illegal I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.650" end="01:22:35.119" style="s2">about five different regulatory agencies</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.019" end="01:22:36.769" style="s2">at the state and federal level that in</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.119" end="01:22:38.090" style="s2">order to do what I wanted to do I would</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.769" end="01:22:39.349" style="s2">have had to comply with all of them and</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.090" end="01:22:43.280" style="s2">that would have taken a million dollars</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.349" end="01:22:46.159" style="s2">I mean yeah yeah that is also jeez I</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.280" end="01:22:49.249" style="s2">just did a video series in my non tech</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.159" end="01:22:50.809" style="s2">way but I don&#39;t edit things um on they</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.249" end="01:22:52.099" style="s2">take the closest thing I&#39;ve gotten to a</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.809" end="01:22:55.190" style="s2">nutshell of what I&#39;m trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.099" end="01:22:56.900" style="s2">like technology&#39;s powerful we can use it</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.190" end="01:22:58.340" style="s2">every day it clearly has given us stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.900" end="01:22:59.929" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t had before it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.340" end="01:23:01.519" style="s2">risky right you&#39;d have to put in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.929" end="01:23:04.249" style="s2">million dollars to create that thing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.519" end="01:23:05.630" style="s2">it might never go anywhere um you create</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.249" end="01:23:07.550" style="s2">goober and it might not go anywhere like</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.630" end="01:23:10.280" style="s2">the Unicorn exists for a reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.550" end="01:23:11.719" style="s2">like a lot of risk that 9 out of 10 fail</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.280" end="01:23:13.340" style="s2">and the more that fail the more the fail</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.719" end="01:23:15.320" style="s2">in the future in my opinion that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.340" end="01:23:17.150" style="s2">of the risky part is that if I put my</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.320" end="01:23:19.340" style="s2">data on something and it goes away I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.150" end="01:23:21.469" style="s2">less likely to trust the next one and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.340" end="01:23:22.820" style="s2">the next one and the next one right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.469" end="01:23:24.590" style="s2">been done and tried can&#39;t be done again</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.820" end="01:23:27.050" style="s2">it&#39;s like right but why did they fail we</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.590" end="01:23:28.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know why they failed um I think a</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.050" end="01:23:30.110" style="s2">cooperative together makes it more</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.460" end="01:23:31.670" style="s2">powerful because there&#39;s things we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.110" end="01:23:34.070" style="s2">do together that Facebook will never be</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.670" end="01:23:36.440" style="s2">able to do then a tiny group of people</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.070" end="01:23:39.260" style="s2">can&#39;t do a for-profit company working in</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.440" end="01:23:40.519" style="s2">isolation I you not transparent can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.260" end="01:23:42.499" style="s2">because we&#39;re not they have to trick us</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.519" end="01:23:44.630" style="s2">into doing it instead of asking us to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.499" end="01:23:46.460" style="s2">it right like hey want to tell us what</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.630" end="01:23:47.780" style="s2">you buy for groceries so we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.460" end="01:23:49.639" style="s2">coordinate make that cheaper for</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.780" end="01:23:53.599" style="s2">everyone right versus like a Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.639" end="01:23:55.849" style="s2">asks you for that they can trick you</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.599" end="01:23:58.010" style="s2">into it give us the first letter will</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.849" end="01:24:01.039" style="s2">give you everything you want will give</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.010" end="01:24:04.249" style="s2">you your Game of Thrones character that</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.039" end="01:24:06.499" style="s2">you are um but then it&#39;s like together</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.249" end="01:24:08.929" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more powerful and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.499" end="01:24:09.139" style="s2">less risky because if you&#39;re creating it</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.929" end="01:24:11.420" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.139" end="01:24:13.010" style="s2">and some than like you have a million</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.420" end="01:24:14.540" style="s2">people putting in a dollar or a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.010" end="01:24:16.909" style="s2">thousand people putting in ten dollars</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.540" end="01:24:18.500" style="s2">so no one&#39;s bankrupt and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.909" end="01:24:19.790" style="s2">choosy like is this nil I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.500" end="01:24:24.020" style="s2">what you&#39;re crazy but is this million</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.790" end="01:24:25.520" style="s2">dollars worth it to you probably not</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.020" end="01:24:27.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of money to risk when you</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.520" end="01:24:29.270" style="s2">don&#39;t you know but like to a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.770" end="01:24:30.770" style="s2">thousand people ten dollars yeah I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.270" end="01:24:32.030" style="s2">try that especially if it has this</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.770" end="01:24:34.670" style="s2">potential to be huge</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.030" end="01:24:37.280" style="s2">right and so to create things together</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.670" end="01:24:40.130" style="s2">in a way that like spreads out the risk</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.280" end="01:24:41.810" style="s2">because we&#39;re yes we trust you or we</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.130" end="01:24:44.030" style="s2">trust your project or we trust the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.810" end="01:24:45.139" style="s2">vision here&#39;s ten dollars right and</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.030" end="01:24:46.429" style="s2">Creina I think that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.139" end="01:24:48.860" style="s2">you&#39;re creating is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.429" end="01:24:50.690" style="s2">people can put money in mark more skin</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.860" end="01:24:53.630" style="s2">in the game and people don&#39;t realize the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.690" end="01:24:56.619" style="s2">importance of skin in the game right you</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.630" end="01:24:59.480" style="s2">want to you want to first be able to</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.619" end="01:25:01.940" style="s2">look I&#39;m not trying to discourage poor</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.480" end="01:25:04.010" style="s2">people I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m not one of them</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.940" end="01:25:09.350" style="s2">but like you know I&#39;m not not a part of</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.010" end="01:25:11.570" style="s2">the 1% but you also don&#39;t you also want</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.350" end="01:25:14.389" style="s2">it no matter how much you want to give</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.570" end="01:25:16.489" style="s2">people some skin in the game some sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.389" end="01:25:20.210" style="s2">that that there is something that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.489" end="01:25:24.170" style="s2">can lose in the investment in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.210" end="01:25:26.110" style="s2">community and also a sense that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.170" end="01:25:28.489" style="s2">have been a contributor so they have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.110" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">psychological stake in it if you like</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.489" end="01:25:33.159" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s important about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:37.610" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.159" end="01:25:39.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like if if you&#39;re cooperative or</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.610" end="01:25:41.090" style="s2">whatever your group if maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.290" end="01:25:44.060" style="s2">mutual aid group like you know I started</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.090" end="01:25:47.840" style="s2">off trying to develop a year ago or a</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.060" end="01:25:49.730" style="s2">year and a half ago is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.840" end="01:25:53.449" style="s2">gonna have a distribution of people and</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.730" end="01:25:55.550" style="s2">a different income levels or an ordinate</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.449" end="01:25:57.020" style="s2">or net worth if you like and so the</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.550" end="01:25:59.810" style="s2">people in the long term you know the</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.020" end="01:26:03.350" style="s2">people out on the part of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.810" end="01:26:05.989" style="s2">distribution who are or don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.350" end="01:26:08.989" style="s2">money even if they can contribute a</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.989" end="01:26:11.719" style="s2">little something that is that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.989" end="01:26:14.989" style="s2">important and if they can&#39;t that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.719" end="01:26:17.869" style="s2">a that they&#39;re included with a view to a</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.989" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">view to the idea that someday they can</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.869" end="01:26:23.060" style="s2">contribute you know cuz that skin in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">game aspect</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.060" end="01:26:27.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just so important absolutely right</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:29.210" style="s2">now like it&#39;s it&#39;s so I have this vision</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.500" end="01:26:30.620" style="s2">of this technological cooperative that</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.210" end="01:26:32.450" style="s2">like I created the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.620" end="01:26:33.890" style="s2">board how we fund it everything and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.450" end="01:26:34.640" style="s2">because I can&#39;t communicate it in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.890" end="01:26:36.140" style="s2">nutshell</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.640" end="01:26:37.430" style="s2">how do you get anyone on board for that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.140" end="01:26:39.350" style="s2">plus it&#39;s not even how it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.430" end="01:26:41.600" style="s2">be I&#39;m like now I&#39;m coming back to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.350" end="01:26:43.160" style="s2">base and recreating it like like we need</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.600" end="01:26:44.570" style="s2">to have the conversations on how to fund</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.160" end="01:26:45.860" style="s2">it how to have the governance structure</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.570" end="01:26:47.360" style="s2">and do that and do so openly</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.860" end="01:26:51.410" style="s2">transparently we actually have our board</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.360" end="01:26:52.880" style="s2">meetings live on YouTube and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.410" end="01:26:55.730" style="s2">creating it in that way now that being</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.880" end="01:26:57.530" style="s2">said nobody has skin in the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.730" end="01:26:59.240" style="s2">watching the free people that show up</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.530" end="01:27:00.680" style="s2">every week right and so but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.240" end="01:27:03.320" style="s2">showing up every week so they kind of do</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.680" end="01:27:05.330" style="s2">have skin in the game but a new person</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.320" end="01:27:07.400" style="s2">popping in and vote like the issue is</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.330" end="01:27:09.680" style="s2">they can&#39;t get both but we want their</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.400" end="01:27:11.720" style="s2">opinion right like until we have a way</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.680" end="01:27:13.580" style="s2">to say you&#39;re a member there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.720" end="01:27:14.150" style="s2">really a vote because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.580" end="01:27:15.710" style="s2">skin in the game</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.150" end="01:27:17.390" style="s2">not like Bentley and I do right like</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.710" end="01:27:20.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not showing up every every</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.390" end="01:27:22.850" style="s2">on-camera the stewards of the mission</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.720" end="01:27:25.550" style="s2">like have you saw me rich in and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.850" end="01:27:27.380" style="s2">crystal clear not a bit crystal clear</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.550" end="01:27:29.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s evolving right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.380" end="01:27:32.450" style="s2">well creating a collaboration platform</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.000" end="01:27:34.160" style="s2">um right now I have the idea Cafe which</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.450" end="01:27:36.710" style="s2">was our first project it might be in</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.160" end="01:27:39.260" style="s2">still our first project which is modeled</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.710" end="01:27:43.310" style="s2">after the World Cafe it&#39;s a way to have</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.260" end="01:27:45.260" style="s2">a conversation with at least a dozen but</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.310" end="01:27:47.720" style="s2">generally dozens hundreds even thousands</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.260" end="01:27:49.640" style="s2">of people in real world so you show up</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.720" end="01:27:51.770" style="s2">you are round tables of four you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.640" end="01:27:54.680" style="s2">having a 20-minute conversation around a</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.770" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">question and then you switch tables and</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.680" end="01:27:58.160" style="s2">then you&#39;re having that same</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:27:59.480" style="s2">conversation or a built on question with</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.160" end="01:28:01.070" style="s2">other people right so like the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.480" end="01:28:02.600" style="s2">groups having a conversation but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.070" end="01:28:04.010" style="s2">having an intimate conversation where</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.600" end="01:28:05.600" style="s2">everyone&#39;s heard and everyone&#39;s listened</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.010" end="01:28:08.120" style="s2">to and it&#39;s you know like collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.600" end="01:28:09.560" style="s2">intelligence and so I was like yes I</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.120" end="01:28:12.380" style="s2">want that I want the technology for that</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.560" end="01:28:14.660" style="s2">so the idea cafe right now because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.380" end="01:28:16.640" style="s2">within my technological technique skills</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.660" end="01:28:19.730" style="s2">is a YouTube channel we have them for</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.640" end="01:28:22.160" style="s2">game B on Tuesdays like 11:30 my time</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.730" end="01:28:23.480" style="s2">and we wrote on the question and we need</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.160" end="01:28:25.040" style="s2">to take five turn in five minutes</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.480" end="01:28:26.540" style="s2">answering the question then we talk for</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.040" end="01:28:28.700" style="s2">the rest of the hour because it&#39;s game</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.540" end="01:28:29.780" style="s2">so I get good boss like emits twenty</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.700" end="01:28:31.910" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.780" end="01:28:34.340" style="s2">the idea is that eventually it&#39;s a half</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.910" end="01:28:36.770" style="s2">an hour time mark on the platform and</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.340" end="01:28:38.330" style="s2">you can come on an end for just</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.770" end="01:28:40.460" style="s2">as many as you want right so every week</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.330" end="01:28:43.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say there&#39;s an umbrella platfor</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.460" end="01:28:45.080" style="s2">like for the world or your your circle</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.880" end="01:28:46.910" style="s2">right your circle if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.080" end="01:28:48.770" style="s2">about food what&#39;s your question that</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.910" end="01:28:50.510" style="s2">week and anyone can participate in that</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.770" end="01:28:52.520" style="s2">and then there&#39;s you have to harvest</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.510" end="01:28:54.140" style="s2">that conversation so there&#39;s anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.520" end="01:28:55.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what we were creating and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.140" end="01:28:57.650" style="s2">doing it openly and transparently I</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.640" end="01:29:01.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know skin in the game that yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.650" end="01:29:02.870" style="s2">having people who like right now they</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.310" end="01:29:05.810" style="s2">don&#39;t but eventually they will like my</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.870" end="01:29:07.010" style="s2">funding model my funding model not ours</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.810" end="01:29:09.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna create it was like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.010" end="01:29:10.850" style="s2">Netflix about so the idea is everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.080" end="01:29:13.310" style="s2">putting in $10 a month and you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.850" end="01:29:14.990" style="s2">on what your what our next project is</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.310" end="01:29:16.850" style="s2">right now if you have a project that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.990" end="01:29:18.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important but you we</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.850" end="01:29:20.690" style="s2">haven&#39;t voted on it you&#39;re welcome to</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.650" end="01:29:23.930" style="s2">fund it with a bunch of people right and</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.690" end="01:29:25.460" style="s2">work through the process and own it in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.930" end="01:29:26.930" style="s2">different way than what we would own</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.460" end="01:29:29.180" style="s2">together right like these are like we</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.930" end="01:29:31.040" style="s2">own them together we&#39;re recreating them</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.180" end="01:29:32.570" style="s2">so we don&#39;t all have to spend $10 a</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.040" end="01:29:34.940" style="s2">month on each individual thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.570" end="01:29:37.190" style="s2">going to be used together including food</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.940" end="01:29:38.600" style="s2">apps financial apps health apps that are</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.190" end="01:29:40.310" style="s2">things that we already use in the real</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.600" end="01:29:41.990" style="s2">world what are the features and benefits</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.310" end="01:29:44.480" style="s2">they have that we like and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.990" end="01:29:46.010" style="s2">incorporate those into one model right</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.480" end="01:29:47.420" style="s2">like none of the food apps work for me</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.010" end="01:29:49.340" style="s2">because I am one of those poor people</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.420" end="01:29:51.410" style="s2">and they don&#39;t allow you to go to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.340" end="01:29:53.450" style="s2">store and be like this is what&#39;s on sale</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.410" end="01:29:56.330" style="s2">give me five recipes for it right it</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.450" end="01:29:58.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t allow me to coordinate with my</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.330" end="01:29:59.870" style="s2">neighbors to bulk I doesn&#39;t allow me to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.130" end="01:30:02.630" style="s2">do all of the things I&#39;m like why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.870" end="01:30:04.280" style="s2">it be like this right I mean doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.630" end="01:30:05.510" style="s2">even allow me to give that option it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.280" end="01:30:07.010" style="s2">just like which one do you want to use</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.510" end="01:30:10.190" style="s2">and they&#39;re all $10 a month we&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.010" end="01:30:19.370" style="s2">you a food budget right like a shopping</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.190" end="01:30:21.430" style="s2">list if they&#39;re good with your neighbors</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.370" end="01:30:25.100" style="s2">to get to get good stuff is pretty neat</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.430" end="01:30:27.590" style="s2">mm-hmm absolutely I mean I&#39;m involved in</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.100" end="01:30:31.130" style="s2">a a lot of my inspiration comes from my</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.590" end="01:30:34.190" style="s2">community that I&#39;m part of where we have</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.130" end="01:30:35.690" style="s2">collective meals together and every time</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.190" end="01:30:38.540" style="s2">I show up for a collective meal which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.690" end="01:30:40.160" style="s2">like every adult cooks and cleans once a</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.540" end="01:30:42.080" style="s2">cycle which is roughly once a month and</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.160" end="01:30:43.970" style="s2">we eat together four times a week so</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.080" end="01:30:46.040" style="s2">every other time you can show up and eat</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.970" end="01:30:47.750" style="s2">at cost right you don&#39;t cook you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.040" end="01:30:49.220" style="s2">have to do the labor and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.750" end="01:30:50.659" style="s2">to do the labor for cooking or cleaning</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.220" end="01:30:52.880" style="s2">or shopping and but when</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.659" end="01:30:55.219" style="s2">on a team you decide on it decide want</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.880" end="01:30:57.229" style="s2">to make you do the grocery shopping and</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.219" end="01:30:59.959" style="s2">you divvy it amongst you know how many</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.229" end="01:31:02.360" style="s2">people signed up for that meal and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.959" end="01:31:05.360" style="s2">you&#39;re confident that sounds like with</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.360" end="01:31:08.360" style="s2">your with your you&#39;re wanting to scale</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.360" end="01:31:10.699" style="s2">that to the level of hey maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.360" end="01:31:14.719" style="s2">know well also it&#39;s also like any I</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.699" end="01:31:16.099" style="s2">because its antivirus and yet its right</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.719" end="01:31:18.169" style="s2">like it&#39;s like not everyone can</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.099" end="01:31:19.639" style="s2">participate in this cohousing meal plan</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.169" end="01:31:22.099" style="s2">right we can&#39;t have a thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.639" end="01:31:23.389" style="s2">showing up in that dinner table but with</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.099" end="01:31:26.179" style="s2">all the churches and community centers</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.389" end="01:31:27.469" style="s2">around one there could be a community</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.179" end="01:31:28.999" style="s2">kitchen in every neighborhood and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.469" end="01:31:30.499" style="s2">could be designed if you want to right</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.999" end="01:31:31.939" style="s2">no one&#39;s in this community are a little</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.499" end="01:31:33.590" style="s2">bit forced to just because that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.939" end="01:31:36.260" style="s2">of the like protocol of living there</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.590" end="01:31:38.119" style="s2">right like you agree to participate in</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.260" end="01:31:39.739" style="s2">that I don&#39;t actually live there I just</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.119" end="01:31:41.209" style="s2">drive because I&#39;ve been part of a</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.739" end="01:31:42.889" style="s2">community since the beginning before it</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.209" end="01:31:45.169" style="s2">was built but I wasn&#39;t able to afford to</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.889" end="01:31:46.610" style="s2">move into it but even the meals like</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.169" end="01:31:49.189" style="s2">there&#39;s none of the meals what I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.610" end="01:31:51.229" style="s2">able to cook for me and my kid at that</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.189" end="01:31:53.209" style="s2">cost especially with the labor like I</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.229" end="01:31:55.189" style="s2">got meal kits in the last few months and</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.209" end="01:31:57.739" style="s2">I was like this is a lot of work a lot</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.189" end="01:31:59.179" style="s2">of waste and the only reason I can</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.739" end="01:32:00.979" style="s2">afford it as I got it on the discount</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.179" end="01:32:02.570" style="s2">right it was like 50% off for the first</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.979" end="01:32:05.150" style="s2">six and I wanted to try a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.570" end="01:32:07.189" style="s2">like this is not better than cohousing</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.150" end="01:32:10.010" style="s2">like I would rather drive to cohousing</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.189" end="01:32:12.919" style="s2">and eat the meal that like do this and</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.010" end="01:32:14.749" style="s2">yet this is such a step up for other</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.919" end="01:32:16.729" style="s2">people that there&#39;s so many exploding</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.749" end="01:32:18.260" style="s2">I&#39;m like first of all that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.729" end="01:32:19.729" style="s2">because the efficiency of it is like</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.260" end="01:32:21.079" style="s2">you&#39;re all accountable izing off of each</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.729" end="01:32:22.489" style="s2">other like literally I signed up for one</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.079" end="01:32:24.860" style="s2">I get all the facebook pads for the</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.489" end="01:32:27.559" style="s2">other ones right like we could come</p>

<p begin="01:32:27.559" end="01:32:31.820" style="s2">socioeconomic status Co housings could</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.289" end="01:32:33.679" style="s2">come together in bulk by food because</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.820" end="01:32:35.689" style="s2">they don&#39;t they&#39;re just like yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.679" end="01:32:37.429" style="s2">going to save on food which is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.689" end="01:32:40.699" style="s2">expensive and sometimes it&#39;s Whole Foods</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.429" end="01:32:43.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s like or Costco like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.699" end="01:32:45.139" style="s2">not it&#39;s somewhat buying in bulk right</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.550" end="01:32:47.239" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna buy for rice for forty</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.139" end="01:32:49.669" style="s2">people is gonna be fresher and cheaper</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.239" end="01:32:51.289" style="s2">and buying it for two people but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.669" end="01:32:52.999" style="s2">not buying it for ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.289" end="01:32:55.489" style="s2">it&#39;s not buying it for like the entire</p>

<p begin="01:32:55.489" end="01:32:57.559" style="s2">it solves</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.999" end="01:32:59.510" style="s2">like those vegans and gluten-free people</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.559" end="01:33:00.919" style="s2">and if you had a citywide program I</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.510" end="01:33:02.889" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.919" end="01:33:09.590" style="s2">this meal</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.889" end="01:33:10.909" style="s2">and you watch as I do to a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.590" end="01:33:14.780" style="s2">of times with the collective</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.909" end="01:33:16.550" style="s2">decision-making there can come still you</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.780" end="01:33:21.409" style="s2">have to ward off the tragedies of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.550" end="01:33:24.650" style="s2">Commons problems if you like which you</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.409" end="01:33:27.590" style="s2">know very much if everybody owns this</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.650" end="01:33:30.679" style="s2">stuff either has to be locally managed</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.590" end="01:33:32.269" style="s2">in though in in the way that Elinor</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.679" end="01:33:33.650" style="s2">Ostrom would have you know no Nobel</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.650" end="01:33:37.849" style="s2">would have would have said you know that</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.869" end="01:33:39.499" style="s2">there that that management of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.849" end="01:33:40.969" style="s2">Commons needs to be local needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.499" end="01:33:42.889" style="s2">transparent and she has all these other</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.969" end="01:33:45.710" style="s2">criteria for how it works because</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.889" end="01:33:47.179" style="s2">Commons management at scale is sucks</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.710" end="01:33:48.710" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible there&#39;s no way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.179" end="01:33:52.940" style="s2">basically and that&#39;s what she won the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.710" end="01:33:55.849" style="s2">Nobel Prize for that message and I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.940" end="01:33:58.940" style="s2">she&#39;s right or you have to have an end</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.849" end="01:34:00.019" style="s2">you have to have a market and take it</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.940" end="01:34:01.729" style="s2">out of the Commons and just make it</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.019" end="01:34:04.699" style="s2">private property and it allocated</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.729" end="01:34:08.449" style="s2">however it&#39;s allocated by the owner but</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.699" end="01:34:10.010" style="s2">in there&#39;s so many opportunities for to</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.449" end="01:34:12.619" style="s2">have interesting commons models</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.010" end="01:34:17.239" style="s2">you just have govern those commons in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.619" end="01:34:18.739" style="s2">way that reflects the pluralism in your</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.239" end="01:34:21.559" style="s2">population the different taste</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.739" end="01:34:23.929" style="s2">preferences and so on absolutely you</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.559" end="01:34:25.159" style="s2">know and that&#39;s where like my vision of</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.929" end="01:34:26.869" style="s2">one that i&#39;m never gonna be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.159" end="01:34:29.059" style="s2">anywhere near by myself like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.869" end="01:34:30.860" style="s2">getting 10,000 people together and</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.059" end="01:34:32.389" style="s2">asking like what do you eat how do we</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.860" end="01:34:33.889" style="s2">make it cheaper how do we do that and</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.389" end="01:34:37.070" style="s2">then eventually getting a system where</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.889" end="01:34:38.749" style="s2">it is you know like that we can enough</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.070" end="01:34:40.159" style="s2">that it&#39;s the mission but bankrupts all</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.749" end="01:34:42.229" style="s2">of the grocery stores overnight because</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.159" end="01:34:43.880" style="s2">grocery stores are really like an if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.229" end="01:34:45.559" style="s2">could get your groceries delivered to</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.880" end="01:34:47.420" style="s2">you at this way cheaper it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.559" end="01:34:49.099" style="s2">environmentally friendly it&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.420" end="01:34:50.840" style="s2">issue is of course is logistics right</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.099" end="01:34:52.550" style="s2">someone has to pack them someone has to</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.840" end="01:34:54.320" style="s2">the warehouse all that well that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.550" end="01:34:56.329" style="s2">of the system it has to be transported</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.320" end="01:35:00.110" style="s2">so instead of paying someone a living</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.329" end="01:35:01.789" style="s2">wage which is important you divvy that</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.110" end="01:35:03.619" style="s2">amongst yourselves right now not</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.789" end="01:35:05.539" style="s2">everyone can drive a truck so like you</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.619" end="01:35:07.909" style="s2">don&#39;t like your cooking you&#39;re cleaning</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.539" end="01:35:10.579" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re driving in your packaging</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.909" end="01:35:12.019" style="s2">whatever it is it&#39;s if there&#39;s 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.579" end="01:35:13.690" style="s2">people and it&#39;s a hundred thousand hours</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.019" end="01:35:16.120" style="s2">everyone&#39;s putting in ten hours</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.690" end="01:35:17.860" style="s2">and as long as you can transparently see</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.120" end="01:35:19.480" style="s2">that it can be cohousing doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.860" end="01:35:20.980" style="s2">that way right it&#39;s like you cook and</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.480" end="01:35:22.990" style="s2">clean your meal perfect doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.980" end="01:35:25.210" style="s2">whether your meal takes eight hours or</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.990" end="01:35:28.000" style="s2">two hours you&#39;ve chosen your meal for</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.210" end="01:35:28.540" style="s2">complexity I like that also but in that</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.000" end="01:35:30.070" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.540" end="01:35:32.380" style="s2">maybe cohousing is part of the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.070" end="01:35:34.210" style="s2">group and so they to collectively</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.380" end="01:35:35.620" style="s2">together need to put in ten hours a</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.210" end="01:35:37.540" style="s2">month to the system of going to</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.620" end="01:35:39.190" style="s2">packaging and doing whatever so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.540" end="01:35:40.900" style="s2">that&#39;s my role in that right I go do</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.190" end="01:35:42.760" style="s2">that and that&#39;s my part of being part of</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.900" end="01:35:43.900" style="s2">the cohousing piece right like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.760" end="01:35:46.780" style="s2">that&#39;s my cooking and cleaning that</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.900" end="01:35:49.330" style="s2">cycle but there&#39;s ways to organize it at</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.780" end="01:35:51.160" style="s2">a larger scale that is just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.330" end="01:35:53.230" style="s2">transparent of what resources were used</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.160" end="01:35:54.760" style="s2">how do we divvy it up who&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.230" end="01:35:56.860" style="s2">what&#39;s getting done what&#39;s not getting</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.760" end="01:35:58.390" style="s2">done and then the more local level of</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.860" end="01:36:00.100" style="s2">like right I don&#39;t want it dictated to</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.390" end="01:36:02.290" style="s2">me with my meal is except I kind of do</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.100" end="01:36:04.420" style="s2">you want to dictate it to my meal is not</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.290" end="01:36:07.180" style="s2">getting a high article down you have to</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.420" end="01:36:08.860" style="s2">make this that doesn&#39;t seem fun but I do</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.180" end="01:36:10.150" style="s2">want someone else to be like these are</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.860" end="01:36:11.230" style="s2">the three meals that are available you</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.150" end="01:36:12.730" style="s2">can make a different one and do what we</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.230" end="01:36:14.890" style="s2">do which is go grocery shopping and plan</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.730" end="01:36:16.240" style="s2">the whole thing or tell us how many</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.890" end="01:36:18.040" style="s2">people and it will be delivered for you</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.240" end="01:36:20.980" style="s2">and we bulk buy it in an even bigger</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.040" end="01:36:22.480" style="s2">amounts and here&#39;s the gluten options</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.980" end="01:36:24.160" style="s2">they can that will also be delivered to</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.480" end="01:36:26.080" style="s2">you right that are like maybe not those</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.160" end="01:36:27.820" style="s2">are versions of those and there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.080" end="01:36:30.370" style="s2">like more efficiency that can happen on</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.820" end="01:36:31.900" style="s2">a larger scale if you&#39;re not being the</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.370" end="01:36:33.820" style="s2">government&#39;s right if you&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.900" end="01:36:38.470" style="s2">bureaucracy and like everyone has to</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.820" end="01:36:41.590" style="s2">like there&#39;s power down then I hate I</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.470" end="01:36:43.510" style="s2">rebel I am like anti like if you tell me</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.590" end="01:36:44.980" style="s2">to do something I will not do it to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.510" end="01:36:47.470" style="s2">point of like I feel like I&#39;m a toddler</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.980" end="01:36:48.970" style="s2">I&#39;m realizing this about myself and now</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.470" end="01:36:50.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like if I won&#39;t do something if</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.970" end="01:36:53.860" style="s2">someone tells me to that&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.260" end="01:36:56.050" style="s2">stupid as doing it do I want to do the</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.860" end="01:36:57.850" style="s2">thing but there&#39;s like that&#39;s just part</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.050" end="01:37:00.070" style="s2">of autism that there&#39;s like that that</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.850" end="01:37:04.240" style="s2">oppositional defiance I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.070" end="01:37:06.520" style="s2">I knew and feeding into that I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.240" end="01:37:07.870" style="s2">right so I&#39;ve created the system of like</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.520" end="01:37:09.700" style="s2">there is no hi I don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.870" end="01:37:11.860" style="s2">power over anyone else and I want anyone</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.700" end="01:37:14.170" style="s2">to have power over me how do we create a</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.860" end="01:37:16.570" style="s2">system where that&#39;s actually possible</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.170" end="01:37:18.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like from the ground up right like</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.570" end="01:37:20.620" style="s2">with like five of us how do we figure</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.250" end="01:37:23.350" style="s2">out how to make decisions without one</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.620" end="01:37:25.540" style="s2">person being in charge without it coming</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.350" end="01:37:27.220" style="s2">down to a power struggle and it&#39;s owning</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.540" end="01:37:27.460" style="s2">the emotions it&#39;s owning all the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.220" end="01:37:29.739" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.460" end="01:37:32.590" style="s2">gonna come up and then like fixing it on</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.739" end="01:37:34.900" style="s2">camera or like everyone can see you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.590" end="01:37:36.430" style="s2">I think you know and I&#39;m not telling you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.900" end="01:37:36.820" style="s2">what to do because I don&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.430" end="01:37:40.600" style="s2">jail</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.820" end="01:37:44.080" style="s2">yeah but uh but I think you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.600" end="01:37:46.270" style="s2">of these things are um we have to just</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.080" end="01:37:49.300" style="s2">keep it simple we shouldn&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.270" end="01:37:50.800" style="s2">perfect be the enemy the good and I and</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.300" end="01:37:52.960" style="s2">I&#39;m a victim of this by the way and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.800" end="01:37:55.090" style="s2">speak from bitter experience because I</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.960" end="01:37:58.330" style="s2">tend to want to go directly to the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.090" end="01:38:01.330" style="s2">and not to the compromise but but</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.330" end="01:38:05.050" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s about iteratively getting</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.330" end="01:38:07.120" style="s2">something pragmatic that serves your</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.050" end="01:38:09.430" style="s2">highest values not all your values but</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.120" end="01:38:11.620" style="s2">your highest values first focus on that</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.430" end="01:38:14.050" style="s2">get something as an MVP that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.620" end="01:38:17.920" style="s2">using and it&#39;s adaptable at the</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.050" end="01:38:19.480" style="s2">periphery or even at the center but</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.920" end="01:38:23.739" style="s2">certainly at the periphery so that you</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.480" end="01:38:27.760" style="s2">can continue that you can continue on</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.739" end="01:38:30.940" style="s2">without idealizing every single aspect</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.760" end="01:38:33.640" style="s2">of it you know for example sometimes a</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.940" end="01:38:34.930" style="s2">community meal might just fail might</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.640" end="01:38:37.750" style="s2">just it might just be that something</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.930" end="01:38:39.280" style="s2">that no one turns up to if if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.750" end="01:38:40.510" style="s2">gonna make lasagna and it&#39;s got a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.280" end="01:38:42.310" style="s2">of gluten in it well I&#39;m just gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.510" end="01:38:43.450" style="s2">to another restaurant tonight I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.310" end="01:38:44.880" style="s2">gonna or I&#39;m just gonna eat peanut</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.450" end="01:38:46.540" style="s2">butter sandwich at home or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.880" end="01:38:53.230" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.540" end="01:38:58.330" style="s2">like sometimes I think creating systems</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.230" end="01:39:00.580" style="s2">of interdependency are healthy but there</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.330" end="01:39:03.760" style="s2">we have to preserve autonomy and we have</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.580" end="01:39:07.810" style="s2">to preserve the certain aspects of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.760" end="01:39:09.130" style="s2">collective good and in our efforts to do</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.810" end="01:39:11.530" style="s2">those things are always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.130" end="01:39:15.219" style="s2">trade-offs for any given instantiation</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.530" end="01:39:16.780" style="s2">of the system so you might another way</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.219" end="01:39:20.080" style="s2">of putting that might be like it&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.780" end="01:39:22.150" style="s2">passing from game a to game B and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.080" end="01:39:24.280" style="s2">don&#39;t think anybody in game and game B</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.150" end="01:39:26.620" style="s2">has a really really rigorous definition</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.280" end="01:39:28.180" style="s2">of what these things are including</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.620" end="01:39:30.700" style="s2">myself so I&#39;m not criticizing it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.180" end="01:39:34.090" style="s2">saying this is hard stuff and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.700" end="01:39:35.830" style="s2">nervous but in that in the but we do</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.090" end="01:39:40.870" style="s2">have an instinct for what gang main game</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.830" end="01:39:42.610" style="s2">B is as we transition and as you</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.870" end="01:39:45.190" style="s2">you start to develop your collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.610" end="01:39:48.280" style="s2">projects recognizing that there are</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.190" end="01:40:03.550" style="s2">trade-offs is okay having to accept some</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.280" end="01:40:05.950" style="s2">short-term pain or unidentified to make</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.550" end="01:40:07.720" style="s2">these trade-offs that so so much that</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.950" end="01:40:09.130" style="s2">and I&#39;m and I really do like the system</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.720" end="01:40:11.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed but it is a compromise</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.130" end="01:40:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a compromise with the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.170" end="01:40:17.200" style="s2">world and that and it&#39;s a competent in</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.800" end="01:40:19.720" style="s2">some situations to compromise with the</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.200" end="01:40:23.350" style="s2">state of the art with the technology the</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.720" end="01:40:25.090" style="s2">legal reality and the lack of resources</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.350" end="01:40:26.860" style="s2">that I have to bring to bear to build</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.090" end="01:40:28.450" style="s2">the damn thing right so there are all</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.860" end="01:40:31.600" style="s2">kinds of trade-offs we have to make and</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.450" end="01:40:35.860" style="s2">in some times when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.600" end="01:40:38.350" style="s2">architecting these systems if we think</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.860" end="01:40:40.420" style="s2">of internally as iterations iterations</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.350" end="01:40:42.310" style="s2">and constant improvement may be using</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.420" end="01:40:46.980" style="s2">holacracy we process the tensions it</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.310" end="01:40:49.930" style="s2">allow us to improve it at the margins or</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.980" end="01:40:52.750" style="s2">being okay with competition you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.930" end="01:40:55.120" style="s2">being okay not you know if we if we say</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.750" end="01:41:00.070" style="s2">no that&#39;s just game a come any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.120" end="01:41:02.230" style="s2">competition is game a or any and and you</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.070" end="01:41:03.910" style="s2">know the it&#39;s interesting that he uses a</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.230" end="01:41:05.500" style="s2">term I think I&#39;m thinking of Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.910" end="01:41:07.270" style="s2">Marton Berger uses a term rival risk</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.500" end="01:41:09.250" style="s2">because when he first used that term I</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.270" end="01:41:13.390" style="s2">was interpreting it in the economic</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.250" end="01:41:15.280" style="s2">sense of scarcity rivalry if I have a if</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.390" end="01:41:18.610" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting on a chair you can&#39;t sit on</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.280" end="01:41:21.730" style="s2">it that kind of rivalry not as</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.610" end="01:41:23.830" style="s2">competition and I think both senses of</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.730" end="01:41:27.580" style="s2">the word or what he&#39;s what he&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.830" end="01:41:32.170" style="s2">for now as that&#39;s been unpacked but um</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.580" end="01:41:36.640" style="s2">sometimes acknowledging rivalries Goods</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.170" end="01:41:39.730" style="s2">as being private property you know is</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.640" end="01:41:44.760" style="s2">okay like my meal and I want it to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.730" end="01:41:48.460" style="s2">gluten-free is okay and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.760" end="01:41:51.970" style="s2">but as we as we start to develop these</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.460" end="01:41:54.050" style="s2">systems we&#39;re gonna have to parse which</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.970" end="01:41:56.599" style="s2">aspects of our</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.050" end="01:41:59.510" style="s2">grunty and/or of our autonomy which you</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.599" end="01:42:01.880" style="s2">which you clearly like and guard as a</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.510" end="01:42:04.040" style="s2">vow for yourself which you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.880" end="01:42:07.280" style="s2">people telling you what to do yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.040" end="01:42:10.340" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be a piece of it but uh but</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.280" end="01:42:11.929" style="s2">also what things that we know we need to</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.340" end="01:42:14.900" style="s2">cede to the community into the</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.929" end="01:42:18.199" style="s2">collective decision-making processes are</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.900" end="01:42:20.710" style="s2">also going to be a factor in this but I</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.199" end="01:42:23.780" style="s2">think as we move along and move forward</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.710" end="01:42:25.880" style="s2">asymptotically towards game B it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.780" end="01:42:27.980" style="s2">be perfect but man it&#39;ll be a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.880" end="01:42:29.780" style="s2">lot better than we&#39;re sitting now yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.980" end="01:42:31.579" style="s2">and that&#39;s all of the things like I can</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.780" end="01:42:34.670" style="s2">find fault and in anything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.579" end="01:42:36.980" style="s2">mine but let me find fault in mine too</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.670" end="01:42:37.969" style="s2">which is why it got to where it is or it</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.980" end="01:42:39.340" style="s2">got to the point where I was like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.969" end="01:42:41.659" style="s2">god this is a solution to everything</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.340" end="01:42:43.309" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not that it&#39;s the solution</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.659" end="01:42:44.809" style="s2">because other people have to clearly get</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.309" end="01:42:46.550" style="s2">on board for it and everyone&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.809" end="01:42:47.719" style="s2">like every time I present something and</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.550" end="01:42:49.360" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a no-brainer people like</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.719" end="01:42:52.130" style="s2">but I&#39;m not like that I&#39;m like really oh</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.360" end="01:42:54.199" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll feed that back into the model</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.130" end="01:42:57.079" style="s2">but it does feed back into the model and</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.199" end="01:42:58.670" style="s2">that&#39;s where to me there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.079" end="01:42:59.989" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to compromise on the coming</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.670" end="01:43:01.340" style="s2">group willing to literally work with</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.989" end="01:43:02.900" style="s2">anyone who wants to work together to</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.340" end="01:43:04.630" style="s2">create something from the ground up but</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.900" end="01:43:06.920" style="s2">am I because it&#39;s like it needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.630" end="01:43:08.659" style="s2">democratic or better transparent and</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.920" end="01:43:10.400" style="s2">diverse those are like the three that</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.659" end="01:43:13.340" style="s2">are my highest values they&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.400" end="01:43:14.540" style="s2">I need it to be but like right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.340" end="01:43:16.340" style="s2">live on YouTube and we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.540" end="01:43:18.650" style="s2">more people so that we can have like a</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.340" end="01:43:21.500" style="s2">five or six person team to work through</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.650" end="01:43:23.000" style="s2">things live on on YouTube and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.500" end="01:43:24.920" style="s2">what I want I want it to be live because</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.000" end="01:43:26.719" style="s2">then even when it breaks down even when</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.920" end="01:43:28.550" style="s2">we get emotionally charged and those</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.719" end="01:43:30.079" style="s2">things happen it&#39;s showcasing what that</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.550" end="01:43:31.880" style="s2">looks like like the behind the scenes of</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.079" end="01:43:34.969" style="s2">creating any project or business right</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.880" end="01:43:36.320" style="s2">like the emotional work all of it partly</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.969" end="01:43:37.909" style="s2">so that the people can have skin in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.320" end="01:43:40.730" style="s2">game and help us solve it as well right</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.909" end="01:43:42.349" style="s2">like Oh including like what like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.730" end="01:43:44.420" style="s2">kind of the board of directors until we</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.349" end="01:43:47.239" style="s2">can figure out something better maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.420" end="01:43:50.270" style="s2">glass frog is that already but figuring</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.239" end="01:43:51.650" style="s2">out how do you make decisions in a</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.270" end="01:43:53.869" style="s2">smaller group because we can meet make</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.650" end="01:43:56.179" style="s2">decisions for the larger group in a way</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.869" end="01:43:58.820" style="s2">that&#39;s effective and part of that is if</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.179" end="01:44:01.639" style="s2">we&#39;re showing you our finances and we go</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.820" end="01:44:04.250" style="s2">bankrupt um did you tell us that these</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.639" end="01:44:05.690" style="s2">were bad finances right like if you</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.250" end="01:44:07.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t see the error neither did we</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.690" end="01:44:09.770" style="s2">who&#39;s at fault right it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.610" end="01:44:11.210" style="s2">everyone kind of has equal authority as</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.770" end="01:44:12.679" style="s2">in like you could have looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.210" end="01:44:15.080" style="s2">finances and could have found the same</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.679" end="01:44:17.239" style="s2">errors could have offered ways to make</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.080" end="01:44:18.739" style="s2">that network and you didn&#39;t so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.239" end="01:44:20.600" style="s2">like passing off your power and</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.739" end="01:44:21.860" style="s2">obligation to its central authority and</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.600" end="01:44:23.840" style="s2">we&#39;re not taking on that central</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.860" end="01:44:27.530" style="s2">authority but it&#39;s working for the</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.840" end="01:44:29.900" style="s2">collective betterment and personally</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.530" end="01:44:31.100" style="s2">figuring out what part if six people</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.900" end="01:44:32.420" style="s2">were like we want to do this but we</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.100" end="01:44:35.150" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be on camera on YouTube</p>

<p begin="01:47:05.480" end="01:47:09.860" style="s2">doing we can process that as the tension</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.130" end="01:47:11.120" style="s2">as a community right so this a very</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.860" end="01:47:14.620" style="s2">different way of looking at it in</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.120" end="01:47:17.210" style="s2">holacracy but they don&#39;t like those</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.620" end="01:47:19.330" style="s2">Commission kind of things because that</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.210" end="01:47:21.830" style="s2">can incentives can pull you away from</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.330" end="01:47:23.469" style="s2">the holistic set of responsibilities</p>

<p begin="01:47:28.940" end="01:47:35.600" style="s2">systems like you know token</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.690" end="01:47:40.130" style="s2">architectures for big populations are</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.600" end="01:47:42.469" style="s2">bad is that for local comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.130" end="01:47:44.210" style="s2">roles in the context of a whole chronic</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.469" end="01:47:47.000" style="s2">organization you might not want to have</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.210" end="01:47:50.270" style="s2">incentives pulling you away from all of</p>

<p begin="01:47:50.270" end="01:47:55.730" style="s2">but in a tokenized environment it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.850" end="01:47:58.070" style="s2">a giant skinner box it&#39;s shaping</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.730" end="01:48:00.679" style="s2">people&#39;s behavior with incentives and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.070" end="01:48:04.370" style="s2">designing the incentive architectures to</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.679" end="01:48:09.500" style="s2">positive effect which i think is a great</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.370" end="01:48:10.639" style="s2">thing to do I think yeah like taking the</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.500" end="01:48:12.199" style="s2">world and being like we have to</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.639" end="01:48:13.520" style="s2">incentivize people it&#39;s the only way no</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.199" end="01:48:14.989" style="s2">one&#39;s gonna create no one&#39;s gonna invent</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.520" end="01:48:16.429" style="s2">unless they&#39;re given a paycheck I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.989" end="01:48:18.260" style="s2">did you look at history that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.429" end="01:48:20.480" style="s2">invented a lot of the stuff right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.260" end="01:48:22.400" style="s2">people who had time and money to do it</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.480" end="01:48:24.469" style="s2">and so if we give people time and money</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.400" end="01:48:26.239" style="s2">they will invent some people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.469" end="01:48:29.630" style="s2">some people are over competitive and</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.239" end="01:48:31.310" style="s2">they will only do it if they get the win</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.630" end="01:48:32.870" style="s2">and the wind to them is money right the</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.310" end="01:48:34.340" style="s2">wind to them is that that&#39;s fine they</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.870" end="01:48:35.119" style="s2">exist they&#39;re in game a they can keep</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.340" end="01:48:37.070" style="s2">playing that game</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.119" end="01:48:38.989" style="s2">but creating a different sense of</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.070" end="01:48:40.040" style="s2">structure here for everything and people</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.989" end="01:48:41.360" style="s2">learned that they volunteer for</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.040" end="01:48:43.969" style="s2">everything so they&#39;re always asking them</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.360" end="01:48:45.530" style="s2">to volunteer and it&#39;s a bad cycle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.969" end="01:48:47.989" style="s2">like no no no no no eventually you guys</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.530" end="01:48:49.880" style="s2">start charging and yeah no it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.989" end="01:48:51.500" style="s2">true but like that the one that I showed</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.880" end="01:48:53.389" style="s2">you that&#39;s now covered in notes the like</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.500" end="01:48:55.040" style="s2">wants aware skills and it like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.389" end="01:48:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s how they they do it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.040" end="01:48:57.710" style="s2">that&#39;s how a thing gets done in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.480" end="01:48:59.570" style="s2">sweet spot where you don&#39;t have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.710" end="01:49:02.480" style="s2">them and it&#39;s its own reward to do it</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.570" end="01:49:04.489" style="s2">all right some things aren&#39;t gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.480" end="01:49:05.840" style="s2">done right and so part of it is looking</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.489" end="01:49:07.639" style="s2">at what&#39;s not getting done and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.840" end="01:49:09.380" style="s2">start and sensitizing it right like in</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.639" end="01:49:11.510" style="s2">the utopian future where this is all</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.380" end="01:49:13.880" style="s2">just exists on a grand scale</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.510" end="01:49:15.860" style="s2">a pothole doesn&#39;t get filled right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.880" end="01:49:17.119" style="s2">like well who has do we have the system</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.860" end="01:49:18.770" style="s2">the Pete&#39;s all the people who have the</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.119" end="01:49:19.639" style="s2">skills that the pothole needs get built</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.770" end="01:49:21.949" style="s2">but it&#39;s still not getting it done</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.639" end="01:49:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to what</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.949" end="01:49:25.880" style="s2">would get them to want to write and</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.599" end="01:49:27.710" style="s2">beyond money like what would make it fun</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.880" end="01:49:28.880" style="s2">what would make it enjoyable to build</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.710" end="01:49:30.080" style="s2">upon are there people out there who</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.880" end="01:49:31.940" style="s2">don&#39;t have the skill and would like to</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.080" end="01:49:35.270" style="s2">do it and can learn it right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.940" end="01:49:37.639" style="s2">fixing that model including incentives</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.270" end="01:49:38.750" style="s2">right in my world we don&#39;t have money</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.639" end="01:49:40.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s a resource more of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.750" end="01:49:42.830" style="s2">resource based economy because I like</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.340" end="01:49:44.570" style="s2">that model better but that&#39;s I like that</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.830" end="01:49:46.489" style="s2">right that&#39;s not necessarily what we get</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.570" end="01:49:48.500" style="s2">to from here right we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.489" end="01:49:50.119" style="s2">get there because there has to be a road</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.500" end="01:49:52.550" style="s2">to get there and there&#39;s all these Forks</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.119" end="01:49:54.080" style="s2">along the way but that does it like if</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.550" end="01:49:55.730" style="s2">somebody was going to come and play life</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.080" end="01:49:57.409" style="s2">music if you&#39;ve got to have a concert</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.730" end="01:49:58.610" style="s2">like a concert to get to Beyonce cuz</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.409" end="01:50:00.110" style="s2">she&#39;s gonna get all the potholes filled</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.610" end="01:50:01.730" style="s2">in the world right you get a ticket by</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.110" end="01:50:04.369" style="s2">filling one of them there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.730" end="01:50:06.260" style="s2">incentivize that are that&#39;s so money</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.369" end="01:50:08.330" style="s2">asked right it&#39;s still reward but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.260" end="01:50:10.310" style="s2">not putting that back into the system</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.330" end="01:50:12.260" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think ever do we get to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.310" end="01:50:15.679" style="s2">point where we make it illegal or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.260" end="01:50:17.210" style="s2">to trade things or not like if you have</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.679" end="01:50:18.679" style="s2">a table and I have something we want to</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.210" end="01:50:20.270" style="s2">exchange it to make that in the legal</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.679" end="01:50:22.790" style="s2">process is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.270" end="01:50:24.409" style="s2">but when we get to such a high degree of</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.790" end="01:50:25.790" style="s2">like wait you have tables you love</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.409" end="01:50:27.050" style="s2">making tables and you want to give them</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.790" end="01:50:28.940" style="s2">out you get to decide who to give them</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.050" end="01:50:30.380" style="s2">to and I love making art and I do the</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.940" end="01:50:31.760" style="s2">same thing and maybe I really like your</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.380" end="01:50:34.340" style="s2">table and you really like my art and we</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.760" end="01:50:36.380" style="s2">decide to do a change right like mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.340" end="01:50:38.300" style="s2">it&#39;s not breaking it just to break it</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.380" end="01:50:40.790" style="s2">say no one gets to have competition</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.300" end="01:50:42.830" style="s2">because I don&#39;t like competition doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.790" end="01:50:43.670" style="s2">work if people thrive under competition</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.830" end="01:50:45.650" style="s2">they need to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.670" end="01:50:47.409" style="s2">competition I just think cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.650" end="01:50:49.010" style="s2">outcompetes competition on a grand scale</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.409" end="01:50:51.170" style="s2">where the</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.010" end="01:50:53.510" style="s2">I think we get to a point where there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.170" end="01:50:55.370" style="s2">no competition in the grand scale of how</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.510" end="01:50:57.500" style="s2">we have it now in the marketplace left</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.370" end="01:51:00.230" style="s2">because a cooperative is always going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.500" end="01:51:02.780" style="s2">out-compete it so well you can also have</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.230" end="01:51:07.010" style="s2">weird hybrids like we compete to</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.780" end="01:51:10.070" style="s2">cooperate right yeah and that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.010" end="01:51:12.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a that to me is it&#39;s like to what</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.070" end="01:51:14.239" style="s2">end I always ask to what end right</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.200" end="01:51:16.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s always got a that question</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.239" end="01:51:17.630" style="s2">has to be answered at some level unless</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.340" end="01:51:20.630" style="s2">you believe in some sort of magical</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.630" end="01:51:22.820" style="s2">transcendence which I don&#39;t and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.630" end="01:51:24.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not totally being utilitarian or</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.820" end="01:51:26.360" style="s2">consequentialist in my thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.410" end="01:51:28.010" style="s2">just it&#39;s just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.360" end="01:51:37.880" style="s2">means-ends thinking right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.010" end="01:51:41.180" style="s2">okay I want to you know well anyway I</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.880" end="01:51:43.450" style="s2">lost that one I had too many trails and</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.180" end="01:51:45.739" style="s2">I didn&#39;t follow any one of them but</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.450" end="01:51:47.239" style="s2">coming up to the two-hour mark I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.739" end="01:51:50.690" style="s2">we should probably keep it to two to two</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.239" end="01:51:53.380" style="s2">hours or under by the conversation no no</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.690" end="01:51:55.700" style="s2">I can&#39;t think enough for inviting me on</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.380" end="01:52:01.940" style="s2">amazing and I&#39;ve really enjoyed it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.700" end="01:52:06.800" style="s2">me too um yeah the means and stuff I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.940" end="01:52:14.870" style="s2">just put it this way if it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.800" end="01:52:18.620" style="s2">like there&#39;s this they&#39;re very very okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.870" end="01:52:21.520" style="s2">there&#39;s this old thinker old neoliberal</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.620" end="01:52:23.780" style="s2">god forbid thinker named Friedrich Hayek</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.520" end="01:52:25.550" style="s2">God you know I said God for because</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.780" end="01:52:28.480" style="s2">people don&#39;t like me or liberals but</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.550" end="01:52:32.120" style="s2">Hayek was particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.480" end="01:52:36.080" style="s2">thinker and he has this distinction</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.120" end="01:52:39.470" style="s2">cosmos in taxes right where cosmos is</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.080" end="01:52:42.920" style="s2">the extended order and it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.470" end="01:52:45.020" style="s2">enabled by rules or protocols that are</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.920" end="01:52:50.180" style="s2">non teleological which is to say there</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.020" end="01:52:51.380" style="s2">is no mission right and then there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.180" end="01:52:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a certain kind of order and then</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.380" end="01:52:56.930" style="s2">there&#39;s another kind of order he calls</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.960" end="01:53:00.230" style="s2">toxis spelled like taxis likes that you</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.930" end="01:53:02.720" style="s2">drive in a ride in but taxes is a</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.230" end="01:53:04.010" style="s2">planned order that has a mission has a</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.720" end="01:53:06.710" style="s2">cific thing that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.010" end="01:53:10.190" style="s2">achieve and that order can be planned</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.710" end="01:53:12.590" style="s2">right it can be planned more locally by</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.190" end="01:53:19.190" style="s2">and usually that is carried out in</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.590" end="01:53:22.070" style="s2">hierarchical fashion and I think this</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.190" end="01:53:23.950" style="s2">was an important distinction he made in</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.070" end="01:53:27.950" style="s2">in in seeing the different ways that</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.950" end="01:53:30.050" style="s2">society gets organized he where he</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.950" end="01:53:32.030" style="s2">thought it was problematic was when you</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.050" end="01:53:35.480" style="s2">people took the plant the planning</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.030" end="01:53:38.380" style="s2">mentality of a an organization and tried</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.480" end="01:53:41.120" style="s2">to to apply it to society writ large</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.380" end="01:53:44.090" style="s2">which he said is too complicated too</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.120" end="01:53:46.730" style="s2">complex actually for any person or group</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.090" end="01:53:48.440" style="s2">it would fry the neural circuitry of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.730" end="01:53:51.860" style="s2">the committee or the person in charge</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.440" end="01:53:54.260" style="s2">and simply can&#39;t be done and he was</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.860" end="01:53:55.820" style="s2">talking specifically about central</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.260" end="01:53:57.920" style="s2">planning societies because he was</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.820" end="01:54:00.110" style="s2">writing this in the 40s and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.920" end="01:54:03.890" style="s2">lot of central planning going on the</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.110" end="01:54:06.020" style="s2">point is though we you and I and the</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.890" end="01:54:07.910" style="s2">game B folks are very very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.020" end="01:54:11.480" style="s2">emergent systems and we know that</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.910" end="01:54:13.580" style="s2">emergent systems have rules but they</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.480" end="01:54:17.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have plans the rules are a</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.580" end="01:54:20.960" style="s2">coordinating mechanism for the actors in</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.630" end="01:54:22.780" style="s2">a network right in their emergent</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.960" end="01:54:24.740" style="s2">phenomena that come out come out of this</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.780" end="01:54:27.770" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting though is I think</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.740" end="01:54:29.780" style="s2">that there&#39;s a hybrid and holacracy I</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.770" end="01:54:31.940" style="s2">think demonstrates very well it this</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.780" end="01:54:36.230" style="s2">could be hybrid is that you can have a</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.940" end="01:54:39.560" style="s2">mission you can have teleological a Tia</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.230" end="01:54:44.270" style="s2">Telos a goal or a mission and have the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.560" end="01:54:45.890" style="s2">benefits of emergence right so Hayek</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.270" end="01:54:47.270" style="s2">says these are separate phenomena but I</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.890" end="01:54:49.100" style="s2">think there&#39;s a third one in there with</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.270" end="01:54:50.750" style="s2">stick merge accustoms</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.100" end="01:54:52.280" style="s2">Paul Hughes is in the game view group</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.750" end="01:54:55.670" style="s2">talks about stick merging systems a lot</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.280" end="01:54:58.070" style="s2">which are like you know you see the the</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.670" end="01:54:59.570" style="s2">murmuration of starlings or you see the</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.070" end="01:55:02.000" style="s2">fish swimming and synchrony in the</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.570" end="01:55:04.280" style="s2">oceans to get away from the tuna or to</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.000" end="01:55:05.420" style="s2">to combat the tuna and keep them away or</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.280" end="01:55:08.210" style="s2">you know so that the whole population</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.420" end="01:55:09.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t die that how are they</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.210" end="01:55:11.600" style="s2">coordinating they&#39;re not there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.650" end="01:55:12.350" style="s2">saying everybody turned left everybody</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.600" end="01:55:14.600" style="s2">turned left</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.350" end="01:55:16.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not happening it&#39;s just it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.600" end="01:55:20.150" style="s2">an internal set of protocols</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.550" end="01:55:21.920" style="s2">that they&#39;ve evolved with yeah fashion</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.150" end="01:55:24.380" style="s2">those protocols but we might share a</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.920" end="01:55:26.960" style="s2">mission and that what I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.380" end="01:55:28.940" style="s2">looking for in what you&#39;re developing</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.960" end="01:55:30.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m really excited to see that</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.940" end="01:55:31.880" style="s2">you&#39;re headed in that direction I know</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.380" end="01:55:34.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.880" end="01:55:36.140" style="s2">I think game B is very much</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.270" end="01:55:39.440" style="s2">acknowledging that we have a diversity</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.140" end="01:55:42.080" style="s2">of different missions but that it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.440" end="01:55:44.330" style="s2">possible to self-organize to a variable</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.080" end="01:55:46.940" style="s2">degree in realism in realizing those</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.330" end="01:55:49.640" style="s2">missions yeah absolutely like part of</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.940" end="01:55:51.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m working on for 2020 by which I</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.640" end="01:55:52.880" style="s2">mean like internally working on how do I</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.380" end="01:55:54.590" style="s2">work with other people now that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.880" end="01:55:56.000" style="s2">saved the world in my head how do I work</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.590" end="01:55:57.140" style="s2">other people and in-game be is a great</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.000" end="01:56:01.430" style="s2">space and having a lot of amazing</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.140" end="01:56:02.750" style="s2">conversations but like my process is</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.430" end="01:56:04.220" style="s2">very alone</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.750" end="01:56:05.810" style="s2">right like it&#39;s very sitting in my room</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.220" end="01:56:07.490" style="s2">figuring this thing out because I like</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.810" end="01:56:09.380" style="s2">that process it&#39;s and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.490" end="01:56:12.290" style="s2">people do a lot of people like tiny</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.380" end="01:56:14.060" style="s2">group or single individual processes but</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.290" end="01:56:16.520" style="s2">how do we have those feedback into a way</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.060" end="01:56:17.900" style="s2">that that is safe enough to fail where I</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.520" end="01:56:19.160" style="s2">don&#39;t need to get it right to show it</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.900" end="01:56:20.990" style="s2">and you know what I mean like how does</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.160" end="01:56:22.400" style="s2">that process then we can come together</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.990" end="01:56:25.190" style="s2">and have parts of it and go away and</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.400" end="01:56:27.770" style="s2">have parts of it what does it look like</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.190" end="01:56:29.570" style="s2">to have autonomous individuals with full</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.770" end="01:56:32.840" style="s2">sovereignty come together and create</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.570" end="01:56:34.970" style="s2">something that is in service to all of</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.840" end="01:56:37.190" style="s2">our missions right - like everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.970" end="01:56:39.110" style="s2">individual project my project&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.190" end="01:56:40.940" style="s2">meta it&#39;s very like we&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.110" end="01:56:42.290" style="s2">everything and own everything together I</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.940" end="01:56:44.000" style="s2">get that that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.290" end="01:56:46.250" style="s2">emerge what&#39;s gonna merge is like</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.000" end="01:56:48.530" style="s2">everyone has individual projects what</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.250" end="01:56:51.470" style="s2">kind of platform could help you find</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.530" end="01:56:53.270" style="s2">people could a project help like create</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.470" end="01:56:57.200" style="s2">that from the ground up and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.270" end="01:56:59.270" style="s2">gonna look like a lot of emergent idea</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.200" end="01:57:00.620" style="s2">Cafe is around that right what could a</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.270" end="01:57:02.660" style="s2">platform look like what could a</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.620" end="01:57:04.850" style="s2">conversation look like that is that is</p>

<p begin="01:57:37.550" end="01:57:40.820" style="s2">off of it and so does everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.320" end="01:57:42.199" style="s2">right everyone else has their platforms</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.820" end="01:57:44.300" style="s2">like yes all the other platforms can</p>

<p begin="01:57:49.940" end="01:57:55.219" style="s2">little pieces that are able to be grown</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.190" end="01:57:57.080" style="s2">an idea cafe the like how do we bring a</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.219" end="01:57:59.869" style="s2">dozen people together it&#39;s brainstorm</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.080" end="01:58:01.610" style="s2">what a technology work looks like in the</p>

<p begin="01:58:21.830" end="01:58:27.860" style="s2">in that place right um like instead of</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.670" end="01:58:30.560" style="s2">needing to solve it just do the</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.860" end="01:58:31.820" style="s2">discussion part and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.560" end="01:58:34.400" style="s2">gonna be working on into the audience</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.820" end="01:58:36.350" style="s2">facilitating that process and having the</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.400" end="01:58:38.139" style="s2">board of directors meetings live so that</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.350" end="01:58:40.219" style="s2">every time you make a mistake personally</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.139" end="01:58:42.619" style="s2">collectively we can learn from it</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.219" end="01:58:45.440" style="s2">together like yep we did that that</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.619" end="01:58:50.150" style="s2">happens well let&#39;s move on let&#39;s learn</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.440" end="01:58:52.489" style="s2">from it and grow yeah I mean it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.150" end="01:58:54.440" style="s2">like you&#39;re I&#39;m curious and we have only</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.489" end="01:58:56.000" style="s2">like two minutes to come up on the you</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.440" end="01:58:58.040" style="s2">know that we actually have one minute</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.000" end="01:58:59.719" style="s2">coming up on the two-hour mark but if</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.040" end="01:59:03.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll indulge me a final question for</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.719" end="01:59:05.300" style="s2">you what&#39;s the what&#39;s the flame that the</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.350" end="01:59:06.469" style="s2">mods are drawn to for this project cuz</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.300" end="01:59:08.090" style="s2">it sounds like you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.469" end="01:59:10.699" style="s2">people interested now what it what are</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.090" end="01:59:12.860" style="s2">they drawn to um I don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.699" end="01:59:14.360" style="s2">people interested so I&#39;m figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.860" end="01:59:15.830" style="s2">the opposite part like what is the</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.360" end="01:59:17.210" style="s2">attractor because I can see the big</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.830" end="01:59:19.730" style="s2">mission I can see how it gives everyone</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.210" end="01:59:21.949" style="s2">everything they want but that&#39;s a not an</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.730" end="01:59:25.280" style="s2">attractor right it needs to be like you</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.949" end="01:59:29.810" style="s2">need this resource so L can&#39;t let you</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.280" end="01:59:31.850" style="s2">know how this is this resource the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.810" end="01:59:33.850" style="s2">hoping the attractor the attractor for</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.850" end="01:59:36.170" style="s2">the right people is that they want to</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.850" end="01:59:37.699" style="s2">create this from the ground up they want</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.170" end="01:59:39.260" style="s2">to do it openly and transparently so</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.699" end="01:59:41.160" style="s2">that we can learn and everyone else can</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.260" end="01:59:42.990" style="s2">learn through that process and Phi</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.160" end="01:59:45.480" style="s2">those people and that&#39;s also what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.990" end="01:59:46.740" style="s2">coming to is like right if it takes a</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.480" end="01:59:48.330" style="s2">thousand people to talk to you to get</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.740" end="01:59:50.730" style="s2">those people that&#39;s totally fine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.330" end="01:59:51.930" style="s2">not a percentage right it&#39;s not fifty</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.730" end="01:59:53.310" style="s2">percent of the people are gonna be into</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.930" end="01:59:54.840" style="s2">this it might be one percent of people</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.310" end="01:59:56.700" style="s2">but I the whole point of the vision is</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.840" end="01:59:57.570" style="s2">that if we find five people that are</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.700" end="02:00:00.360" style="s2">that one percent</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.570" end="02:00:01.770" style="s2">it grows in its own way it&#39;s emergent</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.360" end="02:00:04.530" style="s2">that like we figure out how to work with</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.770" end="02:00:05.880" style="s2">five people but also with the idea we</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.530" end="02:00:09.180" style="s2">want to work with hundreds and we want</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.880" end="02:00:10.500" style="s2">to work with thousands but like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.180" end="02:00:11.850" style="s2">do that we can come up with a protocol</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.500" end="02:00:13.140" style="s2">to work with a hundred people and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.850" end="02:00:14.790" style="s2">bring a hundred people on board and see</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.140" end="02:00:18.750" style="s2">if that works and have them be Prince</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.790" end="02:00:21.150" style="s2">baited it and so maybe your your core</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.750" end="02:00:23.060" style="s2">team can get together and and really</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.150" end="02:00:26.190" style="s2">work on that mission a mission language</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.060" end="02:00:28.350" style="s2">because and it&#39;s just a suggestion it</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.190" end="02:00:30.300" style="s2">may not be ready for it yet but when you</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.350" end="02:00:32.880" style="s2">when you get to that point and you want</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.300" end="02:00:35.010" style="s2">to start attracting people that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.880" end="02:00:36.720" style="s2">do it it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna you got to get to</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.010" end="02:00:39.750" style="s2">the head through the heart for most</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.720" end="02:00:43.110" style="s2">people and you know sitting around and</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.750" end="02:00:46.950" style="s2">talking with geeks like me it only goes</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.110" end="02:00:49.880" style="s2">so far then it&#39;ll have to be what are</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.950" end="02:00:52.230" style="s2">people connecting with here and</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.880" end="02:00:57.840" style="s2">crystallizing that in mission language</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.230" end="02:01:01.200" style="s2">that resonates yeah and I&#39;m also like</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.840" end="02:01:02.670" style="s2">also in a way that&#39;s generative instead</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.200" end="02:01:04.560" style="s2">of like I&#39;m like we&#39;re gonna do snaps of</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.670" end="02:01:08.700" style="s2">capitalism people don&#39;t they&#39;re like and</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.560" end="02:01:10.440" style="s2">what&#39;s left it&#39;s like the world you yet</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.700" end="02:01:12.510" style="s2">is opposed to the world we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.440" end="02:01:16.350" style="s2">away right like what does as opposed to</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.510" end="02:01:18.120" style="s2">I would love to just pour into that as a</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.350" end="02:01:20.670" style="s2">next conversation with you at some point</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.120" end="02:01:22.410" style="s2">and maybe six months from now but um it</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.670" end="02:01:24.840" style="s2">sounds like we&#39;re so close to each other</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.410" end="02:01:28.290" style="s2">on our dreams and aspirations and our</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.840" end="02:01:29.910" style="s2">utopian visions and yet that&#39;s one area</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.290" end="02:01:31.170" style="s2">where I&#39;m like yeah what is she talking</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.910" end="02:01:33.810" style="s2">about why does she want to get rid of it</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.170" end="02:01:36.360" style="s2">but I think the Devils in the in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.810" end="02:01:37.950" style="s2">definitions probably yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.360" end="02:01:39.540" style="s2">it&#39;s more the effects that I want to get</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.950" end="02:01:42.840" style="s2">rid of like I have tons of people I know</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.540" end="02:01:44.760" style="s2">much better capitalistic there are</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.840" end="02:01:46.290" style="s2">conscious capitalists and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.760" end="02:01:47.880" style="s2">this is how we solve it my brother who I</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.290" end="02:01:50.250" style="s2">talk to every Saturday life on YouTube</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.880" end="02:01:51.810" style="s2">if I his own project wiki elections he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.250" end="02:01:54.520" style="s2">like I&#39;m a capitalist I&#39;m like I get it</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.810" end="02:01:55.840" style="s2">I get you can&#39;t see why I think that</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.520" end="02:01:59.980" style="s2">we&#39;re serving profit we&#39;re not serving</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.840" end="02:02:01.060" style="s2">her best but using purpose and profit</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.980" end="02:02:03.100" style="s2">language I was thinking about John</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.060" end="02:02:06.220" style="s2">Mackey I mean that&#39;s his shtick John</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.100" end="02:02:09.040" style="s2">Mack founder of Whole Foods Market he</p>

<p begin="02:02:09.040" end="02:02:13.060" style="s2">you know purpose and profit are two</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.540" end="02:02:14.940" style="s2">sides of the same coin that you can get</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.060" end="02:02:19.210" style="s2">rid of one or the other they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.940" end="02:02:20.890" style="s2">inextricably bound and that&#39;s so he</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.210" end="02:02:23.290" style="s2">can&#39;t he you know that&#39;s part and parcel</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.890" end="02:02:24.760" style="s2">to this whole theory that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.290" end="02:02:27.520" style="s2">architected called conscious capitalism</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.760" end="02:02:29.170" style="s2">so I&#39;m sounds like here is your brother</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.520" end="02:02:31.150" style="s2">you say yeah</p>
