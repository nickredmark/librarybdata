<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:05.850" style="s2">and the next one also is almost well I</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:07.560" style="s2">would stop and ask you to explain these</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:10.349" style="s2">words to me a little bit more because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">have this the question is what is eco</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.349" end="00:00:16.199" style="s2">modest modernism in left acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">ISM how does it envisaged that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.199" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">technological process will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">address climate and ecological breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">and I have to admit that I get a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">bit triggered when I when I see these</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">ISM words and one of my mentors and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">friends Satish Kumar who is the founder</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">of true Maha College where I learned a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">lot of my initial understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">that has helped me for the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">when I did the Masters in holistic</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">science in 2001 Satish says every ism</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:55.430" style="s2">creates a schism and and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:59.870" style="s2">whether it&#39;s capitalism socialism or</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.430" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">environmentalism they all create a box</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.870" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">that you can either put your friends in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">or your enemies in and then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">have to listen to them anymore then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">can just say ah yeah that is an eco</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">modernist and it into eco modernism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">not into that so I stopped listening or</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">socialist or capitalist and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">want you can can explain to me what what</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">you mean by left acceleration ISM or</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2">equal modernism but but for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">we they&#39;re the bigger invitation behind</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">this question is to stop trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">people into these boxes and to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">listen to where each individual is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:44.450" style="s2">coming from and I I assume what eco</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">modernism is is speaking to us is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.450" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">mindset of technology will save the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">world and if we find the right equal</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">technology or regenerative technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">then everything will be fine forever</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">after um it&#39;s probably the like recently</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">in social media there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:12.450" style="s2">the wrong kind of green movement that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:15.390" style="s2">a again dismissing a lot of approaches</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.450" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">of trying to begin to walk the path</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.390" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">towards a regenerative impact as them</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.920" style="s2">are going deep enough there to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">technological that just the the elites</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.920" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">buying into this discourse now and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:30.990" style="s2">trying to co-opt it and yes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">we need to be vigilant about both</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.990" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">processes of co-option but I think we we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have time to stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">quite so drastically listening to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">other and just fight one ism against</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">another so I really stop if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">wants to explain what what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">understand with on the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.630" style="s2">acceleration is then I might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:03:24.870" style="s2">say something about it but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.630" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">what this term refers to so shall we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.870" end="00:03:37.769" style="s2">just skip it okay I think the more the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:41.640" style="s2">main point I made in the beginning is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.769" end="00:03:44.580" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s be careful of making it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.640" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">easy to each other to stop listening</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.580" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">what the other everybody and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:55.620" style="s2">me included and will as you bring in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:03:58.290" style="s2">something new as you bring in a positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.620" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">impulse we&#39;re all trapped in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.290" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">language traps and the thought traps of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">the habits of the past and so everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">new will still have a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">the old left over there what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:14.819" style="s2">serve anymore and and so really the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">invitation is to always listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.819" end="00:04:18.120" style="s2">wisdom in what the other person might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.120" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">their perspective and and not fall into</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">the trap of just looking for the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">thing that we can then categorize what</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">they&#39;re saying into our yeah he&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">from back angle he&#39;s an eco modernist so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:35.790" style="s2">I can stop listening and dismiss him out</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">right and and and make it easier for</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.790" end="00:04:38.699" style="s2">myself I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">point that I would like to make to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.699" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">question</p>
