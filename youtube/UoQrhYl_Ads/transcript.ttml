<p begin="00:00:10.070" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">Zachary Stein huh dr. Zachary sign I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">should say I wanted to talk to you you</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">know for a few reasons</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.029" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">the first thing you know that caught my</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:27.220" style="s2">attention was was your interest in</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:29.720" style="s2">Yvonne Ilic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.220" end="00:00:31.250" style="s2">or the fact that you think in and write</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.720" end="00:00:33.020" style="s2">about Yvonne Ilic a little bit and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.250" end="00:00:37.000" style="s2">seems to be an influence in your work</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.020" end="00:00:40.670" style="s2">and in the 90s I read LH and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.000" end="00:00:42.500" style="s2">it kind of changed my world or it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.670" end="00:00:45.559" style="s2">changed how I saw the world like</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.500" end="00:00:47.000" style="s2">radically in in some sense right and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.559" end="00:00:49.640" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been waiting for somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.000" end="00:00:53.140" style="s2">come along and talk about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.640" end="00:00:55.910" style="s2">you know talk about D schooling society</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.140" end="00:00:59.210" style="s2">and and and like you you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.910" end="00:01:02.690" style="s2">distinguish between education and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.210" end="00:01:06.229" style="s2">schooling right and you talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.690" end="00:01:09.049" style="s2">kind of infinite what did you say an</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.229" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">infinite horizon of Education or</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.049" end="00:01:13.130" style="s2">something like that and and and then and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:15.049" style="s2">then this limitation of schooling that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.130" end="00:01:17.150" style="s2">we have and the fact that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.049" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">between worlds in some sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.150" end="00:01:25.479" style="s2">where whereas we we don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:27.470" style="s2">one mode of living and being seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.479" end="00:01:29.450" style="s2">disintegrating including our education</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.470" end="00:01:31.340" style="s2">system and and another one seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.450" end="00:01:35.450" style="s2">trying to be born with all of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.340" end="00:01:37.369" style="s2">existential threat so yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.450" end="00:01:38.420" style="s2">kind of my introduction and why you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.369" end="00:01:40.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple other reasons actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.420" end="00:01:43.729" style="s2">why I&#39;m interested in talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.539" end="00:01:47.450" style="s2">because one other reason was maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.729" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">can talk about that later is that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.450" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">you said that you were a a dyslexic</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:56.659" style="s2">successful dyslexic I think I think high</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.060" end="00:01:58.609" style="s2">achieving</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.659" end="00:02:01.549" style="s2">excuse me a high achieving a dyslexic</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.609" end="00:02:04.069" style="s2">Ana and I think I think I&#39;m not a high</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.549" end="00:02:09.710" style="s2">achieving dyslexic but I think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.069" end="00:02:11.480" style="s2">dyslexic well you&#39;re a musician I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.710" end="00:02:13.550" style="s2">a musician and that was the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.480" end="00:02:16.370" style="s2">that was the last of the three things</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.550" end="00:02:17.990" style="s2">that I was thinking of which made me</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.370" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">want to to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.990" end="00:02:23.450" style="s2">now besides you know listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.459" style="s2">and and noticing that you had a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.450" end="00:02:28.190" style="s2">clear and lucid voice and important</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.459" end="00:02:31.220" style="s2">things to say so so can you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.190" end="00:02:35.300" style="s2">this can you talk about Yvonne Ilitch</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.220" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">and sure eat schooling Society yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.300" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the main threads</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">throughout my</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:42.380" style="s2">book which you mentioned the education a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">time between worlds is the title and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.380" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">basically Ilic blew it away</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">you blew it away like and you read him</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2">now and you&#39;re like how can it still be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">the way it is given that Ivan Illich</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">wrote this you know that one namely D</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2">schooling society and medical nemesis</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:06.420" style="s2">yeah he gets into the multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.520" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">iatrogenic crises that plague modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">industrial societies but D school and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:13.770" style="s2">society is a remarkable book and even</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">more remarkable because it was written</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.770" end="00:03:19.080" style="s2">before the internet like many of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">ideas that are within and are well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.080" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">would like to say that he&#39;s a prophet of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:25.770" style="s2">some kind like I put I put him in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">category of prophet not just thinker</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.770" end="00:03:30.989" style="s2">yeah um you know totally well I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">was Catholic priest son so that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.989" end="00:03:34.820" style="s2">the prophetic and then the actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">project voice that he had a prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.820" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">voice when hear him speak he has the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">word sound power as the Rastas say you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">know but there&#39;s also a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">because he had a religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:53.850" style="s2">mm-hm it allowed his social critique to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">be even deeper that he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.850" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">looking at evil and not as a secularist</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:04.049" style="s2">explaining it away with evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:06.360" style="s2">theory because we evolved to be meat</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.049" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">machines that compete and kill but Ilic</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.360" end="00:04:13.910" style="s2">no thinking that man has an eternal soul</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">and is yet doing this to himself sick</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.910" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">him namely and so Ilic was seeing very</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">clearly and was pulling no punches and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">so yeah he saw what many people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:32.640" style="s2">seen with the nature of large modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:35.180" style="s2">school systems which is that they are at</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.640" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">their worst profoundly dehumanizing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.180" end="00:04:39.740" style="s2">the apparatus of state control social</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:43.490" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">and ideological indoctrination there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.490" end="00:04:47.030" style="s2">bunch of things you can do with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:49.460" style="s2">school system that you couldn&#39;t that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:52.039" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do if you had a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.460" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">community-based system of Education</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.039" end="00:04:55.699" style="s2">where the parents basically took control</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:04:59.150" style="s2">of their kids which is what it had been</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.699" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">for a very long time and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.150" end="00:05:05.599" style="s2">we know of as schools are political</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.400" end="00:05:07.810" style="s2">entities which began with the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.599" end="00:05:11.300" style="s2">the capitalist world system you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.810" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">belong 16th century now education</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:15.370" style="s2">predates that and other things which</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">we&#39;d like to call school to predate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.370" end="00:05:20.229" style="s2">but what we know with the desks and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">teachers and the routine and schedule</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.229" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">disciplines and the preparation for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:27.289" style="s2">entry into wage labor there&#39;s some one</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:29.990" style="s2">thing you said you said education</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">predates that what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.990" end="00:05:34.729" style="s2">education then I mean when you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">begin doesn&#39;t education begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.729" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">you know the first human in a way I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">correct I mean you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:46.219" style="s2">education as I&#39;m trying to define it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">a kind of species specific trait that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.219" end="00:05:50.930" style="s2">and this is like Michael Tomasello</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:53.210" style="s2">there&#39;s at the Max Planck Institute for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.930" end="00:05:54.889" style="s2">a while really doing very careful</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.210" end="00:05:56.719" style="s2">research differentiating primate</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.889" end="00:05:58.130" style="s2">behavior from human behavior especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.719" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">abusive the intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.130" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">transmission and score so of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:04.690" style="s2">controversial because when you say well</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.740" end="00:06:06.740" style="s2">animals don&#39;t educate one another</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.690" end="00:06:09.289" style="s2">instantly you get the reaction yes of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.740" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">course they do and of course they do but</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.289" end="00:06:13.819" style="s2">what happens is very very different when</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:16.750" style="s2">a monkey shows another monkey how to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.819" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">something then when adult human</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.750" end="00:06:23.569" style="s2">enculturate s-- a infant into</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:26.840" style="s2">toddlerhood into early childhood i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.569" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a qualitatively different kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.840" end="00:06:31.400" style="s2">of intergenerational transmission which</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:34.750" style="s2">may or may not involve schooling but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.400" end="00:06:36.770" style="s2">definitely involves a ton of intimate</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.750" end="00:06:38.870" style="s2">exercise of what I call teach really</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.770" end="00:06:40.940" style="s2">Authority yeah I like that word</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.870" end="00:06:43.099" style="s2">transmission and and I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:46.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s missing from the education</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.099" end="00:06:49.969" style="s2">system is trend is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.039" end="00:06:52.070" style="s2">transmission no I actually think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.969" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re correct that it it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.070" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">to not do</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.340" end="00:06:57.150" style="s2">certain things but one of the reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:06:59.190" style="s2">succeeds is because of the transmission</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.150" end="00:07:01.979" style="s2">of individual teachers like despite the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.190" end="00:07:04.889" style="s2">system despite the fact that it&#39;s set up</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.979" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">to basically dehumanize the kids and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.889" end="00:07:09.330" style="s2">make them into numbers and to turn them</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:11.130" style="s2">into aged laborers the last kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.330" end="00:07:12.630" style="s2">thing that&#39;s left is actually the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.130" end="00:07:15.600" style="s2">thing that&#39;s left is the choosing on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.630" end="00:07:17.370" style="s2">front line sure doing the right thing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.600" end="00:07:19.050" style="s2">the classroom actually loving the kids</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.370" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">and that was my experience where I felt</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.050" end="00:07:23.910" style="s2">completely alienated in high school as</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.810" end="00:07:26.430" style="s2">it dyslexic and so I took to music but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.910" end="00:07:30.030" style="s2">had several teachers who just loved me</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.430" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">anyway and encouraged me anyway I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.030" end="00:07:34.410" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s - I don&#39;t have I&#39;m too many</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:37.710" style="s2">digressions here but but I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.410" end="00:07:40.889" style="s2">in how you did succeed as dyslexic like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.710" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">I mean it was music that actually helped</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.889" end="00:07:45.419" style="s2">you to succeed or something because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">wonder if our obstacles are sparse but</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.419" end="00:07:49.410" style="s2">sometimes the thing that kind of pushes</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:52.440" style="s2">us to excel a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.410" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">sometimes even if it makes certain make</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.440" end="00:07:57.900" style="s2">certain things kind of a struggle or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:08:00.450" style="s2">yeah well I mean there&#39;s two ways I</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.900" end="00:08:02.010" style="s2">think about it one is that dyslexia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.450" end="00:08:03.479" style="s2">actually just a difference it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.010" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">disability just so actually there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.479" end="00:08:10.530" style="s2">a disability in a culture that involves</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.030" style="s2">reading and specifically in alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.530" end="00:08:14.970" style="s2">reading culture and a pictographic</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:17.370" style="s2">reading culture you don&#39;t have things</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.970" end="00:08:21.090" style="s2">like this Fox Theater know you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.370" end="00:08:23.669" style="s2">different things the ideas that you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.090" end="00:08:25.320" style="s2">a like a difference neurologically that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.669" end="00:08:27.660" style="s2">interfaces with the culture in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.320" end="00:08:29.880" style="s2">particular way and in our culture with</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.660" end="00:08:31.979" style="s2">our alphabet and the English language in</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.880" end="00:08:33.419" style="s2">particular in the way it&#39;s taught you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.979" end="00:08:34.650" style="s2">know this luckily just means bad at</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.419" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">reading that&#39;s literally what the word</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.650" end="00:08:38.969" style="s2">means bad like there&#39;s only recently</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:40.650" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to tease apart the why</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.969" end="00:08:43.320" style="s2">are you bad at reading and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.650" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">there&#39;s many forms of dyslexia yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.320" end="00:08:46.440" style="s2">some of them you&#39;ve got a lot of books</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">behind you and you read a lot obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.440" end="00:08:50.570" style="s2">I read a ton which means I&#39;m obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">not the kind of dislikes like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.570" end="00:08:55.589" style="s2">struggles with with reading so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:08:59.190" style="s2">nature of your dyslexia is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.589" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">different then well I mean so there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.190" end="00:09:01.709" style="s2">I haven&#39;t looked at the literature in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:03.660" style="s2">while when I was in graduate school I</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.709" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">looked at it closely and there were two</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.660" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">kinds of dyslexia the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">Gordon and well-liked that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:12.389" style="s2">the the kind that we thought was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:15.269" style="s2">only kind for a long time had to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.389" end="00:09:17.879" style="s2">actually with phoneme and grapheme</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.269" end="00:09:20.790" style="s2">recognition right so can the Year parse</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.879" end="00:09:22.980" style="s2">the speech stream right and can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.790" end="00:09:26.610" style="s2">relate the parsed speech stream to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.980" end="00:09:29.129" style="s2">grapheme appearing on the say and so is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.610" end="00:09:32.670" style="s2">actually some forms of deafness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.129" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">other forms of basically auditory</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">difference that ended up making it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">that they couldn&#39;t figure out the parts</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.199" style="s2">of speech on like auditorally and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:42.329" style="s2">it confused what they were doing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.199" end="00:09:43.740" style="s2">their eyes then there&#39;s another form of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.329" end="00:09:46.379" style="s2">dyslexia which I believe I have which</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:49.620" style="s2">just has to do with the ratio of foveal</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.379" end="00:09:51.480" style="s2">to peripheral vision right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.620" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">something like eighty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.480" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">people in the population have better</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:09:59.129" style="s2">foveal vision than peripheral vision</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:01.019" style="s2">which is to say like they see better</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.129" end="00:10:02.790" style="s2">narrowly right in front of them than</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.019" end="00:10:04.649" style="s2">they do like out if you hold your arms</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.790" end="00:10:05.759" style="s2">out and wave your fingertips at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.649" end="00:10:08.009" style="s2">edges of your vision like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.759" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">peripherally huh but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.009" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">percentage of the population which</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">actually have really good peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:16.019" style="s2">vision and they&#39;re phobia vision was</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:18.209" style="s2">kind of not great they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.019" end="00:10:21.029" style="s2">mostly getting the gestalt and not</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.209" end="00:10:23.630" style="s2">getting the detail oh that&#39;s me holy cow</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.029" end="00:10:26.660" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly so that&#39;s what I am dude</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.630" end="00:10:29.069" style="s2">you can see obviously in some contexts</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:31.800" style="s2">better peripheral vision would be that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.069" end="00:10:34.529" style="s2">would be selected for so that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.800" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">would still be in the system it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.529" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">recently that we would be selecting</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">against this and that&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.910" end="00:10:42.029" style="s2">arguments and when I came up and into</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:44.790" style="s2">this critique of standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.029" end="00:10:48.389" style="s2">because it may be that dyslexics</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:49.709" style="s2">actually should be selected for and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.389" end="00:10:51.329" style="s2">should build a system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.709" end="00:10:53.189" style="s2">select against people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.329" end="00:10:56.579" style="s2">perceives a gestalt rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.189" end="00:10:58.889" style="s2">details and so when I read I actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.579" end="00:11:00.660" style="s2">have struggled with spelling because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.889" end="00:11:03.209" style="s2">don&#39;t read at the level of the grapheme</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.660" end="00:11:04.649" style="s2">or the word necessarily I read something</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.209" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">like at the level of the sentence for</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.649" end="00:11:10.709" style="s2">the paragraph blows me away because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:12.750" style="s2">sounds so familiar to my experience and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.709" end="00:11:14.730" style="s2">I guess my next question is how what</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.750" end="00:11:17.309" style="s2">does that have to do with your interest</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.730" end="00:11:19.779" style="s2">or even my interest in in music how does</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.309" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">that relate to music</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.779" end="00:11:26.529" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:27.699" style="s2">it&#39;s about one way to think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.529" end="00:11:30.279" style="s2">happening here is you know it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.699" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">the perception of patterns and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.279" end="00:11:37.509" style="s2">perception of structure and different</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:39.339" style="s2">ways of doing that and so you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.509" end="00:11:44.529" style="s2">drawn to improvisational music in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.339" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">particular and music that involved very</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.529" end="00:11:51.129" style="s2">little orchestration essentially like</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:55.180" style="s2">Indian classical music like Miles Davis</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.129" end="00:11:57.819" style="s2">from the electric period like a bitches</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.180" end="00:12:00.519" style="s2">brew and these things we&#39;ve got long 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.819" end="00:12:03.660" style="s2">minute tracks with just a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.519" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">chords set and then a ton of free form</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.660" end="00:12:10.449" style="s2">improvisation and my experience in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:13.750" style="s2">was precisely the ability to not be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.449" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">involved in detail at a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.750" end="00:12:18.970" style="s2">and to feel the whole to feel the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:22.629" style="s2">thing as opposed to planning and out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.970" end="00:12:26.139" style="s2">the minutiae and so I gravitated to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.629" end="00:12:27.370" style="s2">music perhaps because I gravitated to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.139" end="00:12:29.829" style="s2">that kind of experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.370" end="00:12:33.339" style="s2">so you didn&#39;t gravitate to the Western</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.829" end="00:12:36.189" style="s2">classical tradition I imagine if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.339" end="00:12:37.959" style="s2">like me it&#39;s the same thing III I could</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.189" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">relate to Indian sounds I could relate</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.959" end="00:12:41.529" style="s2">to African sounds I could relate to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.600" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">know I could write kids it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.529" end="00:12:45.910" style="s2">psychedelic music I could relate to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:48.699" style="s2">know jazz and and all that but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.910" end="00:12:52.689" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t get into you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.699" end="00:12:54.699" style="s2">Mozart or Beethoven or I can only I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.689" end="00:12:56.259" style="s2">I only like soloists like I could get</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.699" end="00:13:01.149" style="s2">into Glenn Gould or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.259" end="00:13:03.009" style="s2">but I is that similar to you or are we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.149" end="00:13:04.509" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re similar I mean I played</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.009" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">trumpet you know I&#39;ve actually played</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.509" end="00:13:09.069" style="s2">trumpet grade school and but reading</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:11.949" style="s2">music was always hard again because of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.069" end="00:13:15.129" style="s2">my peripheral vision so I actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.949" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">of played by ear I&#39;m an illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.129" end="00:13:20.110" style="s2">musician also yeah my grandfather wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:21.339" style="s2">a literate musician and he played jazz</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.110" end="00:13:23.620" style="s2">like you wouldn&#39;t believe it he could</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.339" end="00:13:25.990" style="s2">just jump on a piano and do Oscar</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.620" end="00:13:28.420" style="s2">Peterson exactly you know so so but he</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.300" end="00:14:08.860" style="s2">doing so yeah but of course I came to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.350" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">appreciate Bach like maybe a decade ago</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.860" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">and so I do you know appreciate Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.329" style="s2">music but there&#39;s also this you know</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.329" end="00:14:22.300" style="s2">right and moving out of the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.440" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">called the just intonation or the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:29.380" style="s2">of given physics of Pythagorean reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.970" style="s2">and moving it into something that can be</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.970" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">actually the key they know the keys</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:39.250" style="s2">stacking so that&#39;s another difference to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:43.240" style="s2">I was always drawn to Indian classical</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.250" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">music and and the Blues and things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.240" end="00:14:48.819" style="s2">were actually interesting yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">attempting to to kind of like question</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.819" end="00:14:57.790" style="s2">the you know kind of the the overbearing</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:15:01.000" style="s2">nature of the of the Western structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.790" end="00:15:02.949" style="s2">of music itself that&#39;s the whole blues</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.000" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">note when you pull the blues note down</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.949" end="00:15:12.279" style="s2">on the guitar so it&#39;s like in-between</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:16.589" style="s2">what notes yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.279" end="00:15:19.540" style="s2">well I was a played I play fretless</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.589" end="00:15:21.730" style="s2">featherless bass and so I actually in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.540" end="00:15:25.269" style="s2">college before I did anything seriously</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.730" end="00:15:27.370" style="s2">with books I I was being trained in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.269" end="00:15:29.079" style="s2">Indian classical music on the bass you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.370" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">know like John McLaughlin like Shakti</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.079" end="00:15:34.569" style="s2">style and that was amazing I know so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:36.250" style="s2">much had to do with playing between and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.569" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">playing between the notes that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.250" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">officially exist right yeah no one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:40.990" style="s2">playing actually doesn&#39;t officially</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:42.680" style="s2">exist I can&#39;t actually put it on paper</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.990" end="00:15:47.570" style="s2">and that was gratifying to me because</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.680" end="00:15:50.210" style="s2">on paper didn&#39;t seem as real as reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.570" end="00:15:52.339" style="s2">and also and also you don&#39;t want to just</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.210" end="00:15:54.589" style="s2">imitate things you want to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.339" end="00:15:57.050" style="s2">things a step further or step out into</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.589" end="00:15:59.959" style="s2">chaos a little bit and come back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.050" end="00:16:01.760" style="s2">order or something like that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.959" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">beautiful thing about about that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.760" end="00:16:07.430" style="s2">music or yeah whereas you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.320" style="s2">remember I in Morocco I met a guy he</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.430" end="00:16:11.630" style="s2">said that you know Moroccan music it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.320" end="00:16:14.270" style="s2">just goes on and on like you can&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.630" end="00:16:16.820" style="s2">it on a CD it&#39;s it&#39;s a long story and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.270" end="00:16:18.260" style="s2">also when he hears western music it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.820" end="00:16:20.360" style="s2">sounds like it hasn&#39;t holes in it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.260" end="00:16:24.380" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s missing something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">missing this in-between for him that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.380" end="00:16:28.310" style="s2">that was his perception right was you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:31.790" style="s2">know we would hear kind of a noise or</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.310" end="00:16:34.790" style="s2">yes I perceived the dyslexia as as an</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.790" end="00:16:36.830" style="s2">advantage actually like overall that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.790" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">nervous system is different not</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.830" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">necessarily disabled in certain contexts</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:46.459" style="s2">it was a huge disadvantage and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">I succeeded kind of by luck you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.459" end="00:16:54.580" style="s2">the grace of good teachers I think and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:54.580" style="s2">then certain kind of passion that I had</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.510" end="00:17:01.310" style="s2">which I don&#39;t I can&#39;t kind of like take</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.370" end="00:17:05.650" style="s2">responsibility for just there and has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.310" end="00:17:08.569" style="s2">do with the course that my life took but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:10.010" style="s2">yeah so I did eventually read a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.569" end="00:17:11.270" style="s2">books even though I was dyslexic and do</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.010" end="00:17:13.339" style="s2">a lot of writing but writing of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.270" end="00:17:15.230" style="s2">if we were to look over my shoulder when</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.339" end="00:17:16.760" style="s2">I write you think what the hell is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.230" end="00:17:18.679" style="s2">with this guy&#39;s eye candy smells as he</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.760" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">spells like an eighth grader like I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.679" end="00:17:21.410" style="s2">barely function with the keyboard you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:22.819" style="s2">know it takes a very long time to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.410" end="00:17:24.980" style="s2">construct the instrument well I write</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.819" end="00:17:26.630" style="s2">really quickly and then I write I write</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.980" end="00:17:28.339" style="s2">and then I rewrite narrator I write</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.630" end="00:17:31.160" style="s2">super quickly and I make tons of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.339" end="00:17:33.140" style="s2">mistakes and then I go back and I fix</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:35.420" style="s2">all the mistakes that&#39;s the only way I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.140" end="00:17:37.010" style="s2">can do it I can&#39;t I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.420" end="00:17:41.480" style="s2">people who are so fluid and could just</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.010" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">write no it&#39;s for me it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.480" end="00:17:45.950" style="s2">kind of almost sculpting like at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.740" style="s2">if I&#39;m trying to really articulate</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.950" end="00:17:50.059" style="s2">something clearly other times if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.740" end="00:17:52.100" style="s2">written you know I wrote a book of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.059" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">poetry I would just I would just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.100" end="00:17:55.370" style="s2">I would let the the the error or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.170" style="s2">mistake you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.370" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">remain on the page I think there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.170" end="00:18:03.860" style="s2">forms of writing where or you can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:06.380" style="s2">that right mmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.860" end="00:18:09.290" style="s2">yeah so what about what about what about</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.380" end="00:18:11.059" style="s2">meditation and I know that you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">worked with Ken Wilber for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.059" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">and and I wonder about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:19.930" style="s2">practice if that informs you know how</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:23.980" style="s2">you view all of this it does definitely</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.930" end="00:18:26.930" style="s2">yeah I can was a huge influence on me</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.980" end="00:18:28.580" style="s2">his books and then I began to work with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.930" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">him myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.580" end="00:18:33.950" style="s2">mark Gaffney him mark Gaffney - right</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:37.990" style="s2">yeah may the Center for integral wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.950" end="00:18:41.540" style="s2">and you know during that period yes I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:44.510" style="s2">practiced and very I&#39;m actually the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:48.730" style="s2">kind of a very serious meditate and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.510" end="00:18:51.980" style="s2">also studied Kabbalah and Christian</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.730" end="00:18:53.900" style="s2">traditions of contemplator prayer so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.980" end="00:18:55.250" style="s2">that that weaves in and it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.900" end="00:18:57.530" style="s2">it has - it&#39;s part of the themes of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.250" end="00:18:59.110" style="s2">book about the between world nuts the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.530" end="00:19:02.140" style="s2">between world neces in a sense between</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.110" end="00:19:06.380" style="s2">definitions of sacredness or between</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.140" end="00:19:09.320" style="s2">forms of religiosity forms of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.380" end="00:19:12.770" style="s2">making and even forms of legitimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.320" end="00:19:16.910" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a need to return to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.770" end="00:19:19.070" style="s2">those both traditions and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.910" end="00:19:22.280" style="s2">the practices they imply that my</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.070" end="00:19:25.070" style="s2">transcend any given tradition so examine</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.280" end="00:19:26.570" style="s2">for example yeah I hate to say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.070" end="00:19:28.940" style="s2">because it sounds so ridiculous but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.570" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">also started in Zen so I&#39;m we have so</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.940" end="00:19:33.860" style="s2">many things in common it seems you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:36.230" style="s2">I also did a lot of Zen practice when</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.860" end="00:19:47.420" style="s2">I&#39;m in my 20s right while I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.230" end="00:19:48.770" style="s2">Ivan Illich and Ken Wilber books and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.420" end="00:19:50.330" style="s2">people forget the early ones like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">oblong project for example everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.330" end="00:19:54.740" style="s2">thinks of the four quadrants and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">things which came much much later he he</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.740" end="00:19:59.450" style="s2">was first and foremost a you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:01.130" style="s2">transpersonal psychologist kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.530" end="00:20:07.790" style="s2">written for meditators and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.010" end="00:20:08.690" style="s2">psychotherapists and people who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.790" end="00:20:10.040" style="s2">mostly concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.690" end="00:20:14.680" style="s2">about the psyche and its transformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.040" end="00:20:18.790" style="s2">and salvation and that in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.680" end="00:20:22.430" style="s2">yeah ken was a gift in the sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.790" end="00:20:24.020" style="s2">when I when I and and then of course</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.020" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">graduate school ended up subsuming him</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.970" end="00:20:41.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s something also I can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.970" end="00:20:43.850" style="s2">credit for you said he had laudable</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.000" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">faults I like that phrase it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.850" end="00:20:49.790" style="s2">liabilities it was and you said at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:51.230" style="s2">end of your book was right the end of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.790" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">your book that you know our strengths</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.230" end="00:20:56.180" style="s2">are close to our weaknesses and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:57.590" style="s2">I was thinking like I was thinking one</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.180" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s kind of disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.590" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">about our culture at the moment is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:03.770" style="s2">take a guy like Ken Wilber and you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:05.810" style="s2">to have this opinion about him like</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.770" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">before or against and in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.810" end="00:21:11.930" style="s2">strong dichotomous you can&#39;t just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:13.540" style="s2">you know take what is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.930" end="00:21:15.680" style="s2">valuable there and you know not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.540" end="00:21:18.800" style="s2">subscribe to everything and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.680" end="00:21:20.360" style="s2">because we all have faults right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.800" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">now you&#39;re touching on the crisis of tea</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.360" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">truly authority right that our culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:28.790" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t know how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:31.100" style="s2">teach really Authority and that means it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.790" end="00:21:33.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to be a student because</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.100" end="00:21:34.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve consumed we&#39;ve confused the role</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.140" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">of student as learning with the role of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.730" end="00:21:42.590" style="s2">student as consumer so for against it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:44.570" style="s2">like voting or shopping whereas learning</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.590" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">is much much more complex and teach</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.570" end="00:21:48.440" style="s2">really a teacher the authority is much</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:51.350" style="s2">more nuanced than just you take</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.440" end="00:21:54.200" style="s2">everything or leave everything and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.350" end="00:21:56.360" style="s2">teachers know that yeah good teachers</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.200" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">anyway and so yeah you&#39;re right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.360" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">very difficult situation to be in as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.070" end="00:22:03.470" style="s2">culture when it&#39;s impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:04.820" style="s2">establish the necessary dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.470" end="00:22:06.230" style="s2">teach really Authority that could</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.820" end="00:22:08.180" style="s2">facilitate intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.230" end="00:22:10.120" style="s2">transmission to perpetuate civilization</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.180" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">so you end up getting a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.120" end="00:22:14.840" style="s2">bifurcation of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:16.460" style="s2">transmission which looks like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.840" end="00:22:18.950" style="s2">have anything to teach me</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.460" end="00:22:22.249" style="s2">yeah and but on the other side I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.950" end="00:22:23.720" style="s2">have anything to offer that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.249" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">I was also thinking I&#39;m also a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.720" end="00:22:28.220" style="s2">and I was thinking with my students that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:29.749" style="s2">that I was as asked him one time do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.220" end="00:22:32.809" style="s2">have any heroes yeah is there anybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.749" end="00:22:36.200" style="s2">that came up to or aspire to be like and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.809" end="00:22:38.929" style="s2">it&#39;s like no like it&#39;s like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.200" end="00:22:41.480" style="s2">like in the society having somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.929" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">higher than you as an offense like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:45.769" style="s2">all supposed to be exactly the same or</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:47.539" style="s2">you know Authority would beam that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.769" end="00:22:49.519" style="s2">would you know you would love somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.539" end="00:22:51.799" style="s2">and and what you know even want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.519" end="00:22:54.499" style="s2">them in a sense or not to be like them</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.799" end="00:22:56.059" style="s2">but well you see if you were to expand</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.499" end="00:22:59.299" style="s2">it beyond reality you would get them to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.059" end="00:23:01.070" style="s2">admire certain characters and stories</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.299" end="00:23:03.110" style="s2">and TV shows and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.070" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">and so it actually has to do with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.110" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">displacement into the simulation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:11.990" style="s2">into fantasy that&#39;s part of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:14.629" style="s2">late lean capitalist cultural industry</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.990" end="00:23:19.220" style="s2">so yeah that there&#39;s a confusion about</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.629" end="00:23:23.210" style="s2">yeah how to how to receive how to grow</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.220" end="00:23:25.340" style="s2">on with the help of others help they get</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.210" end="00:23:28.429" style="s2">it in the simulacrum is what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.340" end="00:23:30.350" style="s2">like yeah like on Netflix or right</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.429" end="00:23:33.049" style="s2">through watching you know endless dramas</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.350" end="00:23:36.710" style="s2">or right is that that&#39;s one way to view</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.049" end="00:23:39.429" style="s2">it and then the you know I think the you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.710" end="00:23:44.409" style="s2">know the difficulties compounded by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.429" end="00:23:48.830" style="s2">actual errors and mistakes of supposed</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.409" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">thority right so it&#39;s like if it&#39;s if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.830" end="00:23:55.940" style="s2">could find a way for everyone to lose</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">face together as opposed to needing one</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.940" end="00:24:00.019" style="s2">party to lose face and the other party</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:02.169" style="s2">triumphs so the difficulty with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.019" end="00:24:05.990" style="s2">teach early Authority is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.169" end="00:24:07.730" style="s2">of course teachers are incomplete right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.990" end="00:24:12.049" style="s2">like of course we needed to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.730" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">for Western culture for example to tell</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.049" end="00:24:18.590" style="s2">certain histories right about certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:20.059" style="s2">people&#39;s and actions and we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.590" end="00:24:22.309" style="s2">able to grapple with that as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.059" end="00:24:24.470" style="s2">and then see tragedy and move into</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.309" end="00:24:27.289" style="s2">something like a post tragic form of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.470" end="00:24:28.050" style="s2">cultural authority yeah before that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.289" end="00:24:30.690" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.050" end="00:24:32.490" style="s2">in the situation where everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.690" end="00:24:35.550" style="s2">calling on everyone else to lose face</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.490" end="00:24:41.340" style="s2">and to relinquish authority but by whose</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.550" end="00:24:45.030" style="s2">authority in your book as well that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.340" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">idea of post post tragedy it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.030" end="00:24:49.800" style="s2">tragedy is like the postmodern era right</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">where everything just gets reduced and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.800" end="00:24:55.800" style="s2">then the post tragedy is is is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:57.510" style="s2">now that everything&#39;s broken you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.800" end="00:25:01.350" style="s2">trying to find the pieces and put them</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.510" end="00:25:06.150" style="s2">back together and well yeah I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.350" end="00:25:10.200" style="s2">you know the the postmodern is that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.150" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">the kind of surfacing of the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.200" end="00:25:14.580" style="s2">that&#39;s one way one way to view it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:17.070" style="s2">now you can&#39;t get stuck in tragedy you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.580" end="00:25:18.570" style="s2">know you can&#39;t get stuck in just shadow</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.070" end="00:25:20.250" style="s2">work and doing endless circles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.570" end="00:25:22.950" style="s2">bringing up all the dark stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.250" end="00:25:25.350" style="s2">that&#39;s not the goal you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.950" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">can&#39;t get stuck in retelling the horrors</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.350" end="00:25:29.880" style="s2">of colonialism and you can&#39;t get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:31.680" style="s2">in like there&#39;s we need to tell these</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.880" end="00:25:35.580" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not either/or</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.680" end="00:25:37.020" style="s2">we can&#39;t not tell them because then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.580" end="00:25:38.940" style="s2">kids get to say we&#39;re illegitimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.020" end="00:25:43.230" style="s2">teacher the authorities and we would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.940" end="00:25:45.660" style="s2">right so we can&#39;t lie and we can&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.230" end="00:25:47.640" style="s2">the truth but we need to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.660" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.640" end="00:25:53.010" style="s2">we can&#39;t displace it we can&#39;t get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:55.880" style="s2">in it either and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.010" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2">postmodern malaise or fragmentation or</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.880" end="00:26:05.910" style="s2">inertia is that there&#39;s nothing beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.340" end="00:26:09.180" style="s2">the tragic and that&#39;s the zombie myth I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.910" end="00:26:13.020" style="s2">was talking to John drove a key about</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.180" end="00:26:15.410" style="s2">this zombie is the anti tragic figure</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.020" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">because there&#39;s no redemption for him</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.410" end="00:26:21.240" style="s2">he&#39;s just as he just remains a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:23.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to the there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.240" end="00:26:26.070" style="s2">no end to the zombie stories they just</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.010" end="00:26:28.110" style="s2">keep multiplying whereas whereas in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.070" end="00:26:30.600" style="s2">tragic in a tread in a real tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.110" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of catharsis you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.600" end="00:26:35.580" style="s2">get you get from from as you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">grappling with right Brent Brandon yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.580" end="00:26:41.020" style="s2">no I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not that the post tragic</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.020" end="00:26:46.030" style="s2">is the resolution of the tragedy or</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:47.800" style="s2">somehow when the music kicks back in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.030" end="00:26:50.140" style="s2">everyone&#39;s smiling and the story wraps</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.800" end="00:26:52.390" style="s2">up right it&#39;s not the post tragic the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.140" end="00:26:57.400" style="s2">post tragic actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.390" end="00:27:00.160" style="s2">continues to reside in the tragic and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.400" end="00:27:02.890" style="s2">case what do you mean by that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.160" end="00:27:04.990" style="s2">very interesting yeah the post tragic</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.890" end="00:27:07.570" style="s2">continues to reside within the tragic in</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.990" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">other words you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.570" end="00:27:11.860" style="s2">saying we can&#39;t deny the tragic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:14.620" style="s2">saying you absolutely can&#39;t deny tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.860" end="00:27:17.260" style="s2">and in fact you can&#39;t avoid it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.620" end="00:27:20.490" style="s2">your looks square at it I mean death for</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.260" end="00:27:23.500" style="s2">example yeah okay this is Illinois about</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.490" end="00:27:26.530" style="s2">that the medical system actually steals</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.500" end="00:27:30.850" style="s2">from us the art of dealing with our own</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.530" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">suffer and it steals from us the dignity</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.850" end="00:27:37.720" style="s2">of confronting pain and death on our own</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:39.820" style="s2">terms and so that&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.720" end="00:27:41.740" style="s2">looking at tragedy as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.820" end="00:27:44.400" style="s2">actually putting tragedy off onto</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.740" end="00:27:46.540" style="s2">someone else as their responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.400" end="00:27:49.930" style="s2">whereas death is something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.540" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">look at every day and in a sense your</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.930" end="00:27:54.520" style="s2">deaths a tragedy but in another sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">once you&#39;ve looked at it long enough you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.520" end="00:27:58.930" style="s2">realize it&#39;s the reason that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:28:02.700" style="s2">living and so similarly with other</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.930" end="00:28:07.480" style="s2">tragedies if you stay in it long enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.700" end="00:28:10.300" style="s2">yeah it transforms and so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.480" end="00:28:14.470" style="s2">we&#39;re being called to do into that sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.300" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">of sweetness of impermanence or</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.470" end="00:28:21.880" style="s2">I mean in it and it steals into a new</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:25.300" style="s2">form of character or identity you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.880" end="00:28:28.810" style="s2">that the tragedy is you in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.300" end="00:28:31.780" style="s2">place in time and that the you on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.810" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">other side of the tragedy is different</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.780" end="00:28:37.090" style="s2">you know the alchemists talk about kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:39.490" style="s2">of darkening or pewter occasion they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.090" end="00:28:42.460" style="s2">blackening right and that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.490" end="00:28:44.290" style="s2">dissolution and the calling up and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">remembrances of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.290" end="00:28:49.690" style="s2">the you know another how commence rains</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:52.990" style="s2">would be something like the unendurable</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.690" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">image right the unendurable images into</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.990" end="00:28:59.020" style="s2">the tragedy this is the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:29:01.240" style="s2">can&#39;t stand to imagine the thought that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.020" end="00:29:03.730" style="s2">you can&#39;t hold but these are the exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.240" end="00:29:06.400" style="s2">the thought you need to hold until it</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.730" end="00:29:08.710" style="s2">changes and until the darkening and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.400" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">purification allows for the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.710" end="00:29:15.250" style="s2">something new that wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:17.170" style="s2">there without it and so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.250" end="00:29:20.560" style="s2">tragic things often the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.170" end="00:29:25.900" style="s2">cannot be resolved and just fixed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.560" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">the thing that needs to be served and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.900" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">yeah again this is the issue but if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">can&#39;t get out of crises of teacher the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">authority and denial so the post truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.020" style="s2">thing goes both ways right the post</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:41.650" style="s2">truth in both denies the tragedies</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.020" end="00:29:44.800" style="s2">happened and on the other side denies</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.650" end="00:29:48.940" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way out of tragedy right</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.800" end="00:29:50.830" style="s2">and which is to say there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.940" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">true fir there&#39;d be a way out of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.830" end="00:29:57.790" style="s2">right and there needs to be legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:00.010" style="s2">authentic Authority you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.790" end="00:30:04.120" style="s2">morality and ethics that matter these</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.010" end="00:30:05.770" style="s2">narrative you know because</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.120" end="00:30:08.230" style="s2">post-modernism is the death of all</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.770" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">narratives but right so so you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.230" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">refined the golden thread of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">narrative right if the golden thread the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">narrative and the and the ability again</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">to for everyone to lose face together</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">like what is that language even look</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:24.460" style="s2">like do we have that language you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s all folk together</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.460" end="00:30:31.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not the solution it&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.820" end="00:30:32.910" style="s2">everyone lose face together like what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.060" end="00:30:37.930" style="s2">that language even look like for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.910" end="00:30:40.300" style="s2">and who right now when I said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.930" end="00:30:41.950" style="s2">like well I mean how my group well the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.300" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">word that came to mind when you said</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.950" end="00:30:47.490" style="s2">that was a tone meant or something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:47.490" style="s2">atonements a good word</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.860" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:55.130" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know how exactly we got to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:57.680" style="s2">this point but well the next really deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.130" end="00:31:00.170" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re in pretty deep actually I I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.680" end="00:31:03.410" style="s2">tend to skip formalities and things like</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.170" end="00:31:04.850" style="s2">this in this podcast because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.410" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">because of some of the frustration you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.850" end="00:31:12.560" style="s2">spoke with the kind of form of a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:15.650" style="s2">so anyway the next the next place that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.560" end="00:31:19.640" style="s2">this leads to is is is you have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.650" end="00:31:21.830" style="s2">idea of concrete utopia so so we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.640" end="00:31:24.410" style="s2">tragedy and then we have post tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.830" end="00:31:26.840" style="s2">and now we have concrete utopia do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.410" end="00:31:29.870" style="s2">want you want to get into that your 13</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.840" end="00:31:33.170" style="s2">utopias or so they yeah the 13 social</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.870" end="00:31:36.350" style="s2">miracles as a form of concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.170" end="00:31:38.300" style="s2">fear mmm-hmm yeah I mean obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.350" end="00:31:39.860" style="s2">word utopia we can trace it and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.300" end="00:31:42.020" style="s2">pejorative at this point utopia right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.860" end="00:31:46.580" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s why I wanted you to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.020" end="00:31:49.400" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.580" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing a lot of work studying</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.400" end="00:31:57.050" style="s2">like the 30 Years War in Europe and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">secret societies within that that usher</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.050" end="00:32:02.180" style="s2">goes through from the Renaissance to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:03.980" style="s2">Enlightenment there was a dicey period</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.180" end="00:32:06.370" style="s2">with the Inquisition&#39;s and the 30 Years</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:10.070" style="s2">War which is kind of the first world war</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.370" end="00:32:12.290" style="s2">and this figure IMO&#39;s John Amos Comenius</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.070" end="00:32:17.930" style="s2">is the greatest educational reformer</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.290" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever lived and basically was</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.930" end="00:32:22.940" style="s2">working right after bacon right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:28.460" style="s2">her right after the first utopians like</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.940" end="00:32:31.280" style="s2">wrote their utopias and so he took the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.460" end="00:32:33.050" style="s2">utopian scheme which ended up being kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.280" end="00:32:34.790" style="s2">of like infused with a certain rustic</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.050" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">Russia essence and then began to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.790" end="00:32:39.080" style="s2">around Europe talking to all the kings</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:41.540" style="s2">convincing them to make the utopia</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.080" end="00:32:44.150" style="s2">concrete Comenius was actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.540" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">the first concrete utopian theorists in</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.150" end="00:32:49.510" style="s2">history living in the 1600s basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:52.010" style="s2">turning specifically More&#39;s utopia</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.510" end="00:32:54.470" style="s2">solomon&#39;s temple within it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.010" end="00:32:57.800" style="s2">educational reforms of like a full-stack</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.470" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">technological society it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.800" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">stuff and so the idea to conquer utopia</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:07.830" style="s2">is that you find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">exercise the imagination like the social</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.830" end="00:33:12.690" style="s2">imagination in a much much more radical</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.420" style="s2">way based on something that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.690" end="00:33:18.810" style="s2">utopian theorizing based on like</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.420" end="00:33:20.580" style="s2">principles right based on ideals and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.810" end="00:33:23.880" style="s2">then you begin to try to relate it</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.580" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">directly to what&#39;s actually exist and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.880" end="00:33:27.720" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the only way to do critical</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:30.510" style="s2">theory if you actually think about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.720" end="00:33:34.410" style="s2">like a woman named Ben Habib I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.510" end="00:33:36.510" style="s2">wrote a book called critique in utopia I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.410" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">think it was comments that Hamas and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.510" end="00:33:39.390" style="s2">the critical theorists basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">and you look at critical theory there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.390" end="00:33:42.900" style="s2">always the utopian moment and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:44.580" style="s2">diagnostic moment there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.900" end="00:33:47.430" style="s2">moment of critique and there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.580" end="00:33:49.770" style="s2">the moment of laying out the vision of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.430" end="00:33:50.700" style="s2">what could be better now often the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.770" end="00:33:51.180" style="s2">vision of what could be better is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.700" end="00:33:53.220" style="s2">implicit</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.180" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s crypto you never say it you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.220" end="00:33:58.140" style="s2">critiquing dirty critiquing but implicit</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:00.150" style="s2">in the critique is that there&#39;s some way</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.140" end="00:34:03.510" style="s2">that it might not be that way right that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.150" end="00:34:05.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some way that&#39;s not bad so</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.510" end="00:34:09.030" style="s2">there&#39;s always there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.040" end="00:34:12.170" style="s2">utopian moment in any kind of step of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.030" end="00:34:15.210" style="s2">criticism so the concrete utopians</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.170" end="00:34:16.890" style="s2">ended up doing that work where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.210" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">actually suggesting it in almost an</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.890" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">insane way they&#39;re almost kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">saying hey wait have you stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:26.580" style="s2">slowed down actually look at this we</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">could do it very very differently let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.580" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">use a couple of thought experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.490" style="s2">seem utopian to begin to spark the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.770" style="s2">imagination to get us thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.490" end="00:34:36.930" style="s2">what to actually do on the ground and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.770" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">Roy Bhaskar was where I got the actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.930" end="00:34:43.980" style="s2">term from concrete utopian theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:47.670" style="s2">because he was so you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.980" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">disgruntled with the the crypto</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.670" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">normative ISM of post-modernism which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:53.160" style="s2">the sign of critique the critique the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">critique the critique always implying</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.160" end="00:34:58.050" style="s2">that there is an actual better way but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:34:59.430" style="s2">never stating the better way because if</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.050" end="00:35:01.650" style="s2">you state the better way then now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.430" end="00:35:03.300" style="s2">open to critique but if you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.650" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">critique critique critique and then have</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.300" end="00:35:08.070" style="s2">a crypto normative ISM which you smuggle</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:08.940" style="s2">in the utopian moment behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.070" end="00:35:12.109" style="s2">that never talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.940" end="00:35:14.279" style="s2">and so Bhaskar started to</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.109" end="00:35:16.680" style="s2">basically a kind of like concrete</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.279" end="00:35:20.690" style="s2">utopian thicker theorizing to contre</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.680" end="00:35:24.049" style="s2">kind of counteract you overtly and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.690" end="00:35:26.609" style="s2">pessimistic and nihilist thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.049" end="00:35:29.130" style="s2">critiques of the postmodernist so I kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.609" end="00:35:32.670" style="s2">of take that up with the 13 social</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.130" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">miracles and basically run a set of five</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.670" end="00:35:38.930" style="s2">experiments which are concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:45.079" style="s2">experiments which are in one sense naive</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.930" end="00:35:49.500" style="s2">but in another sense close enough to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.079" end="00:35:51.799" style="s2">actual reality to be provocative and to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.500" end="00:35:54.569" style="s2">be in a sense not a political platform</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.799" end="00:36:01.730" style="s2">but a disciplined way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.569" end="00:36:03.779" style="s2">futures you have something to aim for</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.730" end="00:36:05.640" style="s2">yeah in a simple sense you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.779" end="00:36:07.109" style="s2">something to aim for and otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.640" end="00:36:11.819" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re just gonna spin</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.109" end="00:36:13.980" style="s2">around in nihilism correct but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.819" end="00:36:18.690" style="s2">that you&#39;re making explicit like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.980" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a come to terms with what</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.690" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">you need to imagine actually get there</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.430" end="00:36:24.630" style="s2">yeah right like if we need to step out</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:26.490" style="s2">of the languages of critique and get</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.630" end="00:36:28.650" style="s2">into the languages of commitment let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.490" end="00:36:31.140" style="s2">say then we need to actually play a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.650" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">different kind of language game where</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.140" end="00:36:34.529" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer yelling at one another</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.450" style="s2">about how we suck and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.529" end="00:36:38.490" style="s2">collaborating on what we might build</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.450" end="00:36:41.069" style="s2">together that would be preferable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.490" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s also traditional in a way too</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.069" end="00:36:45.299" style="s2">because that&#39;s the promised land or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:50.609" style="s2">city on the hill or you know correct</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.299" end="00:36:53.099" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve always lived 11 yeah as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.609" end="00:36:55.500" style="s2">framework of you know where we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.099" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">go or something like that right yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.500" end="00:36:59.220" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s you know there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:00.839" style="s2">book I can&#39;t remember the guy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.220" end="00:37:02.519" style="s2">called the image of the future and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.839" end="00:37:04.349" style="s2">basically it&#39;s this note he tracks it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.519" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">all the way through the ancient sea like</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.349" end="00:37:12.269" style="s2">we&#39;ve always had these profound images</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:14.250" style="s2">of what the human will become basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.269" end="00:37:16.980" style="s2">and they used to be apocalyptic and very</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.250" end="00:37:19.559" style="s2">dramatic and or they weren&#39;t but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.980" end="00:37:21.809" style="s2">know we&#39;ve lost that we in a sense weak</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.559" end="00:37:22.460" style="s2">and I&#39;ve said this somewhere like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.809" end="00:37:25.790" style="s2">know CAPA</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.460" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine its own infinitely which</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.790" end="00:37:29.329" style="s2">is to say like there&#39;s there&#39;s a limit</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:32.210" style="s2">to the imagination of what we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.329" end="00:37:35.079" style="s2">conceive right now is possible socially</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.210" end="00:37:38.990" style="s2">because of the habituation</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.079" end="00:37:40.010" style="s2">to the current civilization and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.990" end="00:37:41.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing that concur</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.010" end="00:37:44.390" style="s2">utopian theorizing the students</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.390" end="00:37:48.410" style="s2">disrupting a virtual thought pattern or</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.390" end="00:37:50.089" style="s2">at least attempting to and again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.410" end="00:37:53.329" style="s2">not novel you know I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.089" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">science fiction tries to do this usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.329" end="00:37:58.520" style="s2">we get dystopian science fiction but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:02.950" style="s2">usually in the dystopian science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.520" end="00:38:08.119" style="s2">there&#39;s like a couple images of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.950" end="00:38:10.309" style="s2">utopian kind of setup and so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.119" end="00:38:12.170" style="s2">there&#39;s the possibility to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.309" end="00:38:14.270" style="s2">restructure the social imagination by</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.170" end="00:38:17.420" style="s2">doing concrete utopian theorizing on</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.270" end="00:38:19.609" style="s2">scale and in popular culture as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:22.579" style="s2">to having zombie movies having movies</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.609" end="00:38:24.770" style="s2">that portray a near-future scenario</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.579" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">that&#39;s extremely realistic where things</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.770" end="00:38:30.020" style="s2">start going well and you show what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:31.579" style="s2">technology applications could actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.020" end="00:38:33.349" style="s2">look like and how things could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.579" end="00:38:34.940" style="s2">different with medicine and education</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.349" end="00:38:37.579" style="s2">and show a world that&#39;s actually working</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.940" end="00:38:39.500" style="s2">that&#39;s close enough to this world that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.579" end="00:38:44.420" style="s2">actually ends up being very critical of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.500" end="00:38:46.190" style="s2">this world like I think around 2000 you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.420" end="00:38:48.829" style="s2">know around the time Trump was elected</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.190" end="00:38:50.990" style="s2">you could say I started even though like</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.829" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">this was a kind of traumatic moment for</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.990" end="00:38:58.190" style="s2">for everybody on some level this was</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:39:00.470" style="s2">also the moment and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.190" end="00:39:02.089" style="s2">saying Trump&#39;s a great guy I already</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.470" end="00:39:04.700" style="s2">thing like that I think this was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.089" end="00:39:07.130" style="s2">the moment I think of wherewhere where I</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.700" end="00:39:10.250" style="s2">started to think that okay everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.130" end="00:39:13.339" style="s2">falling apart so then this is the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.250" end="00:39:15.619" style="s2">where a constructive new purposing could</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.339" end="00:39:17.270" style="s2">could it could occur right and then I</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.619" end="00:39:18.710" style="s2">started coming up with finding people</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.270" end="00:39:22.250" style="s2">like Alexander Bardot was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.710" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">the Eco topia and you know that being a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.250" end="00:39:26.900" style="s2">constructive concept and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:29.150" style="s2">just constructive concepts right and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.900" end="00:39:30.710" style="s2">hadn&#39;t even hadn&#39;t even considered that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.150" end="00:39:32.660" style="s2">there would be constructive concepts</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.710" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s just like cuz you know I it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.660" end="00:39:36.380" style="s2">would be just I would just be in my in</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:41.029" style="s2">doing tantric buddhic Buddhist practice</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:43.819" style="s2">and that would be it but I but in in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.029" end="00:39:47.029" style="s2">in the general culture I think I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.819" end="00:39:49.339" style="s2">think anything was going on right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.029" end="00:39:51.079" style="s2">now I have this slight feeling that like</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.339" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">something&#39;s going on and you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.079" end="00:39:54.049" style="s2">about it and other people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:57.529" style="s2">about it that there&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.049" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">going on right now and the comparison to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.529" end="00:40:00.829" style="s2">that to the thirty years war and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:02.750" style="s2">shift in the world system with</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.829" end="00:40:05.180" style="s2">convenient Kongregate opium vision and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.750" end="00:40:06.589" style="s2">that being held together with kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.180" end="00:40:07.970" style="s2">bunch of constructive theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.589" end="00:40:09.319" style="s2">happening behind the scenes this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.970" end="00:40:11.180" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now we&#39;re transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.319" end="00:40:15.140" style="s2">the whole civilizations transition thank</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2">you right or its end or ten things right</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.140" end="00:40:18.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s always a possibility you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.150" end="00:40:20.750" style="s2">to keep in your mind as well right both</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.920" end="00:40:22.849" style="s2">of those things you know well and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.750" end="00:40:24.589" style="s2">they&#39;re both they&#39;re both true like if</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.849" end="00:40:28.009" style="s2">something new does emerge then this</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.589" end="00:40:29.809" style="s2">civilization ends if something new</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.009" end="00:40:31.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t emerge this civilization also</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.809" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">ends now it&#39;s two different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.640" end="00:40:39.529" style="s2">ending the civilization and yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:41.480" style="s2">is a sense that when things start to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.529" end="00:40:43.700" style="s2">break apart that you get new</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.480" end="00:40:45.589" style="s2">possibilities new light shining through</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.700" end="00:40:48.049" style="s2">that it&#39;s precisely because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.589" end="00:40:49.460" style="s2">have one hegemonic narrative anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.049" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">they were getting on if people</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.460" end="00:40:53.240" style="s2">triangulating true that&#39;s from different</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:55.480" style="s2">angles that never would have been seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.240" end="00:40:57.710" style="s2">because of the dominance of the one</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.480" end="00:40:59.660" style="s2">narrative now the apps the complete</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.710" end="00:41:00.589" style="s2">absence of narrative is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.660" end="00:41:02.569" style="s2">become a problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.589" end="00:41:04.220" style="s2">sure again we&#39;re between worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.569" end="00:41:07.009" style="s2">being between worlds means that there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.220" end="00:41:09.619" style="s2">an absence of go ahead coherent</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.009" end="00:41:12.349" style="s2">narrative how could it be otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.619" end="00:41:16.700" style="s2">given the scope of planet ization in the</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.260" end="00:42:23.309" style="s2">about Gerard because I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.760" end="00:42:24.750" style="s2">you&#39;re like I have an image to hear</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.309" end="00:42:26.819" style="s2">people talking more about Ivan Illich</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.750" end="00:42:28.680" style="s2">these are thinkers that sort of spoke</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.819" end="00:42:30.359" style="s2">before their time and and are now</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.680" end="00:42:33.329" style="s2">extremely important it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.359" end="00:42:36.119" style="s2">totally and Gerard I think is again he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.980" end="00:42:47.400" style="s2">way you end scapegoating is by imitating</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.740" end="00:42:51.059" style="s2">Christ you know that Christ taught us to</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.369" end="00:43:28.020" style="s2">he&#39;s saying that there&#39;s sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.020" end="00:43:30.869" style="s2">on</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.540" end="00:43:37.950" style="s2">yeah totally and as a development</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.790" end="00:43:40.140" style="s2">obviously yeah and as a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.950" end="00:43:41.690" style="s2">psychologist it seems clear that there</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.140" end="00:43:44.339" style="s2">are certain levels of development when</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.690" end="00:43:47.180" style="s2">forms of memetic violence and imitation</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.339" end="00:43:50.819" style="s2">lock-in but there are post conventional</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.180" end="00:43:52.890" style="s2">forms of identity development where are</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.819" end="00:43:54.599" style="s2">the idea that the motivation for your</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.890" end="00:43:57.569" style="s2">behavior would be entirely mimetic is</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.599" end="00:43:59.430" style="s2">actually absurd and so there&#39;s not a cap</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.569" end="00:44:02.380" style="s2">there if there appears to be a cap on</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.430" end="00:44:06.010" style="s2">the Gerardi and development that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.380" end="00:44:07.480" style="s2">everyone is stuck like on Facebook in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.010" end="00:44:09.910" style="s2">mimetic violence and that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.480" end="00:44:12.780" style="s2">designed that way by the way because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.910" end="00:44:16.080" style="s2">connection with rutile and Gerard but</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.780" end="00:44:18.910" style="s2">but the deeper story is actually no</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.080" end="00:44:22.840" style="s2">Gerard himself says there&#39;s a way out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.910" end="00:44:26.410" style="s2">this dynamic of memetic violence which</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.840" end="00:44:28.600" style="s2">leads to scapegoating and those types of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.410" end="00:44:31.930" style="s2">the way out even if you weren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.600" end="00:44:33.400" style="s2">Christian would still be the Messiah and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.930" end="00:44:34.990" style="s2">the Messiah technically means in Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.400" end="00:44:38.590" style="s2">they&#39;re raising or the changing of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.990" end="00:44:40.420" style="s2">conversation yes and so yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.590" end="00:44:42.220" style="s2">correct that the way out even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.420" end="00:44:44.200" style="s2">not a Christian is to move into post</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.220" end="00:44:46.270" style="s2">conventional forms of more autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.200" end="00:44:49.780" style="s2">and sovereign identity which would allow</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.270" end="00:44:55.120" style="s2">you to not imitate violence when you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.780" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">it to make yourself subject to it in</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.120" end="00:45:00.340" style="s2">order to stop it and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:02.020" style="s2">lesson of Christ and again it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.340" end="00:45:05.530" style="s2">staying in the tragedy not avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.020" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">tragedy and leave good dynamic is about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.530" end="00:45:11.350" style="s2">avoiding the tragedy whereas the you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:15.010" style="s2">know as your Rob&#39;s massive collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.350" end="00:45:17.290" style="s2">denial of some kind yeah right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.010" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">so again it&#39;s interesting that I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.290" end="00:45:24.910" style="s2">Gerard is read into as a cynical</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:28.390" style="s2">narrative when I actually read him as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.910" end="00:45:30.310" style="s2">kind of a Christian mystic almost like</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.390" end="00:45:37.980" style="s2">if you take it seriously enough and see</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.310" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">the way life is getting into myth no I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.980" end="00:45:43.150" style="s2">agree with you I well I think he&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:50.650" style="s2">you read them correctly it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.150" end="00:45:53.590" style="s2">good news right kind of good news but</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.650" end="00:45:55.170" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s still good news right if</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.590" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">getting nailed to the cross is good news</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.170" end="00:46:02.890" style="s2">well the ego has to be crucified and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:05.890" style="s2">know perhaps think of it that way or is</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.890" end="00:46:08.350" style="s2">that right no that&#39;s a good way to think</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.890" end="00:46:10.809" style="s2">about when you think about the demands</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.350" end="00:46:14.799" style="s2">of consolidating identity</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.809" end="00:46:16.869" style="s2">post-convention levels yeah it&#39;s uh you</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.799" end="00:46:18.909" style="s2">know as Maslow said about the self</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.869" end="00:46:23.439" style="s2">transcending that it&#39;s the altar on</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.909" end="00:46:27.999" style="s2">which you sacrifice your ego not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.439" end="00:46:29.319" style="s2">means by which you gratify your ego but</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.999" end="00:46:31.449" style="s2">the whole term which you sacrificed it</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.319" end="00:46:34.119" style="s2">means it&#39;s not the thing you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.449" end="00:46:42.209" style="s2">often where you find self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.119" end="00:46:42.209" style="s2">an actual maturity mm-hmm yeah</p>
