<p begin="00:18:47.230" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">questions just waiting for them to come</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.570" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">up on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.730" end="00:19:09.060" style="s2">so the first is from Andy Hema struttin</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.390" end="00:19:10.740" style="s2">which I promise to come back and a treat</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.060" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">in depth which I would like to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.740" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">I think this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:16.650" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:20.220" style="s2">Andy writes I&#39;m not sure was because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.650" end="00:19:24.600" style="s2">my ADH East it stimulation stimulant</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.220" end="00:19:28.220" style="s2">medication I had a weird scary psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.600" end="00:19:31.230" style="s2">like experience have you got any insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.220" end="00:19:34.860" style="s2">and I&#39;m really mind as I want to carry</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.230" end="00:19:37.680" style="s2">on started well meditating and carried</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.860" end="00:19:39.930" style="s2">on for like a half an hour but where</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.680" end="00:19:43.170" style="s2">they have felt really present after at</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.930" end="00:19:44.850" style="s2">all weird experience from the next</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.170" end="00:19:46.650" style="s2">couple of sips I felt paranoid but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">just labeled it and it somewhat went</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.650" end="00:19:52.920" style="s2">away after okay so the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.420" end="00:19:58.050" style="s2">should note is that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.920" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">practices have potential negative side</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:20:07.230" style="s2">effects as I mentioned the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">practices can have these generate weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.230" end="00:20:11.970" style="s2">experiences where you hear your name</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:16.110" style="s2">called hours flash of light or electric</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.970" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">shock right the cheap practices there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.110" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">I mean this is typically for people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">practice it very excessively theirs was</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:28.980" style="s2">achieved syndrome where people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:35.940" style="s2">psychophysical interact integration goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.980" end="00:20:40.260" style="s2">askew so part of the reason why I teach</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.940" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">you an ecology of practices is not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.260" end="00:20:44.370" style="s2">sole reason by any means but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">therapeutic reason which is by having</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.370" end="00:20:48.950" style="s2">multiple different practices they act as</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:52.650" style="s2">checks and balances and you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.950" end="00:20:55.620" style="s2">I think the right word is over committed</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.650" end="00:20:58.920" style="s2">to any particular practice so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.620" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">important to try and first of all engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.920" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">in the entire ecology on practices again</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:08.700" style="s2">everything I teach you should have</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">mastery but you should have an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.700" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">of practice meditative alright</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:17.159" style="s2">contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:20.119" style="s2">AG Kong practice and some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.159" end="00:21:23.159" style="s2">practices that we&#39;re going to idea so</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.119" end="00:21:25.019" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to pursue an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.159" end="00:21:27.139" style="s2">of practice it&#39;s very important to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.019" end="00:21:29.759" style="s2">what you did Andy which was to share</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.139" end="00:21:31.710" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to you what you did</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.759" end="00:21:34.399" style="s2">with the Sangha and you get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.710" end="00:21:38.340" style="s2">people reporting and that this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.399" end="00:21:40.200" style="s2">that aberrant an experience all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.340" end="00:21:43.399" style="s2">so that&#39;s just the general thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.200" end="00:21:45.869" style="s2">everybody if you get these abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.399" end="00:21:48.299" style="s2">experiences in which you may feel he</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.869" end="00:21:51.090" style="s2">personalized or he realized very</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.299" end="00:21:54.179" style="s2">important to share them to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.090" end="00:21:58.200" style="s2">them to make sure that right you you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.179" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">have a sense of cultivating mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.200" end="00:22:04.109" style="s2">outside of so let&#39;s say it&#39;s invokana</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:06.119" style="s2">like do meta and oh this is how I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.109" end="00:22:08.460" style="s2">cultivate this and I&#39;m not getting the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.119" end="00:22:09.859" style="s2">same experience there so all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.460" end="00:22:13.409" style="s2">very important</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.859" end="00:22:18.989" style="s2">next this is also very important I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.409" end="00:22:22.409" style="s2">know you and so if this is a persistent</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.989" end="00:22:26.119" style="s2">pattern with you I would recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.409" end="00:22:27.989" style="s2">you ameliorate this the practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.119" end="00:22:30.929" style="s2">significantly reduce how deep you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.989" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">doing it hour long year sitting and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.929" end="00:22:35.759" style="s2">you seek out professional therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:37.619" style="s2">intervention if on the other hand and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.759" end="00:22:42.119" style="s2">this is what seems to be happening as</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.619" end="00:22:46.139" style="s2">you immerse yourself in annek the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.119" end="00:22:48.779" style="s2">dynamic ecology of practices and in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.139" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">living Sangha and as you continue on</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.779" end="00:22:53.609" style="s2">with the practice if you find it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">ameliorating then that&#39;s generally a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.609" end="00:23:00.570" style="s2">good sign that you should keep going but</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:03.629" style="s2">and again I can&#39;t teach you everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.570" end="00:23:06.149" style="s2">at once and again I there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.629" end="00:23:07.769" style="s2">stuff to go so I&#39;m going to do a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.149" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">for shutting we&#39;re going to do this more</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.769" end="00:23:12.299" style="s2">in depth when we&#39;re doing the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:15.409" style="s2">Hypatia and we we do this section on</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.299" end="00:23:17.999" style="s2">stoicism but we need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.409" end="00:23:21.059" style="s2">practices that help with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.999" end="00:23:25.580" style="s2">self-deception around how our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.059" end="00:23:27.299" style="s2">are formed and and get intervene on</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.580" end="00:23:31.139" style="s2">certain ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.299" end="00:23:32.940" style="s2">thinking can sort of spin off so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.139" end="00:23:35.009" style="s2">going to recommend first of all three</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.940" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">one of three books so you can get all</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.009" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">three books if you want here&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">book biased</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:48.269" style="s2">I&#39;ll cognitive biases in Tarot judgment</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.269" end="00:23:57.929" style="s2">biases and then here&#39;s the third book</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:24:00.929" style="s2">cognitive biases a popular guide because</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.929" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to recommend for for all</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.929" end="00:24:05.220" style="s2">of us but also for you in particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:07.889" style="s2">Andy is to cultivate what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.220" end="00:24:09.419" style="s2">active open mindedness I could open</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.770" end="00:27:46.650" style="s2">you when you started engaging the act of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.920" end="00:27:48.450" style="s2">reducing the itch does the itch start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.650" end="00:27:51.650" style="s2">immediately disappear even before you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.450" end="00:27:53.389" style="s2">scratch because then take note of that</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.389" end="00:27:58.729" style="s2">so now they&#39;re very clever weighing the</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.729" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">to distract you and get you involved and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:05.659" style="s2">get you out of state okay yeah monkey</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:08.659" style="s2">mind is not your enemy and monkey mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.659" end="00:28:11.779" style="s2">is not your enemy okay so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.659" end="00:28:13.669" style="s2">know because that means right that again</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.779" end="00:28:16.849" style="s2">it&#39;s much more and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.669" end="00:28:18.709" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing abnormal or stigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.849" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">about this right but that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.709" end="00:28:23.869" style="s2">another way in which your monkey mind is</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.029" style="s2">sort of distracting is distracting you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.869" end="00:28:30.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit sort of psychosomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.029" end="00:28:33.349" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s so the basic principle</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.709" end="00:28:35.269" style="s2">with itches are trying to apply the five</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.299" end="00:28:47.320" style="s2">your breath I&#39;m if you get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.539" end="00:28:50.809" style="s2">where you&#39;re just enduring as a start</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.320" end="00:28:53.299" style="s2">mindfully scratch but see what have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.809" end="00:28:57.739" style="s2">see what happens even before you scratch</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.299" end="00:29:01.579" style="s2">is the itch ameliorating because that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.739" end="00:29:03.019" style="s2">tells you that it&#39;s it&#39;s way in which</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.579" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">you&#39;re building up a habit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.019" end="00:29:07.159" style="s2">distraction</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:09.589" style="s2">okay so just paper go ahead and scratch</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.159" end="00:29:11.509" style="s2">but note that pay attention to it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.589" end="00:29:18.999" style="s2">maybe you won&#39;t even need to scratch it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.509" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">all and then go back on to City OS teen</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.999" end="00:29:23.959" style="s2">service then sometimes when I get a</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.959" end="00:29:29.749" style="s2">should I let it tilt a hold it back</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.419" end="00:29:31.789" style="s2">thank you ah sorry oh that was a pun</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.749" end="00:29:39.399" style="s2">haha there was a performative punishes</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.789" end="00:29:44.419" style="s2">that it ah yes that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.399" end="00:29:46.639" style="s2">because I think if the experience is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.419" end="00:29:53.749" style="s2">happening spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.639" end="00:30:00.049" style="s2">and you are not identifying the practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.749" end="00:30:02.269" style="s2">with achieving ah then letting your body</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.049" end="00:30:05.629" style="s2">do what it needs to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.269" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">unfold that experience is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.629" end="00:30:09.010" style="s2">right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:13.900" style="s2">eunbi I hope he sends my caution because</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.010" end="00:30:16.390" style="s2">these special experiences can we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.900" end="00:30:18.280" style="s2">very quickly equally even if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.390" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">sort of consciously say to ourselves say</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.280" end="00:30:24.040" style="s2">ah that&#39;s the point of this practice the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:28.860" style="s2">point of this practice is it is my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.040" end="00:30:33.720" style="s2">personal ah induction machine right dad</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:37.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s a worry and a concern because</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.720" end="00:30:42.130" style="s2">while ah is relevant to the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.570" end="00:30:44.620" style="s2">of wisdom pursued exclusively it will be</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.230" end="00:30:53.890" style="s2">so as long as it&#39;s arising spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:56.650" style="s2">and you do not get disappointed this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.890" end="00:30:59.410" style="s2">the mark if you have a sit and you don&#39;t</p>
