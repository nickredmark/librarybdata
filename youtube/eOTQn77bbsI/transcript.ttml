<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:10.110" style="s2">wanted to give you an update personally</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.230" end="00:00:13.769" style="s2">about what happened over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.110" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">days as I hosted 25 people in my home</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">for a workshop on how to manage</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">planetary collapse it was a truly</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">incredible experience and for those of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:26.849" style="s2">you who have been following along or if</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">you were one of the participants you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.849" end="00:00:32.250" style="s2">know that it was a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:37.610" style="s2">experience for all of us we were changed</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.250" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">by the process and part of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.610" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">realignment in the body that we felt was</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">this shared acceptance that a collapse</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">process has been happening since well</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.120" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">before we were born and that the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">biodiversity the impacts due to climate</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">change the increasing human population I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">mean you&#39;re just go on and on looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:06.530" style="s2">the major planetary scale changes that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:10.590" style="s2">are being driven by human activity that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.530" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">once we accepted how complex that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.590" end="00:01:17.930" style="s2">changes and overwhelming it is and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">that some of it has already happened and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.930" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">much of what&#39;s coming and the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">decade is a kind of inertia that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">can&#39;t avoid that things will be lost</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">that are sacred and we have to accept it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">this basic starting point was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">chrysalis of transformation for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">realizing how much power we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">create regeneration and healing of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">ecosystems including human communities</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">as we move forward and that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:55.969" style="s2">collapse process is going to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">unfold for decades if not centuries and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.969" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">that regeneration is the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">come out of overshoot and collapse we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">gone too far across planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:10.129" style="s2">we are now reaching and passing tipping</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:11.880" style="s2">points of unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.129" end="00:02:15.380" style="s2">accelerations</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.880" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">and this is the time for us to boldly</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.380" end="00:02:21.660" style="s2">ambitiously learn how to collaborate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">regenerate the world we spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.660" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">time in this workshop talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">human development and education about</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:33.270" style="s2">how people&#39;s minds and bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">affected by stress and anxiety how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.270" end="00:02:39.150" style="s2">shuts them down through fear and pain to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">the ability to be open and trusting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.150" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">the ability to sense and discern what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">happening around them and our group</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">through a process of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">collaboration which was the way I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">facilitated the event gave us the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.610" end="00:03:00.960" style="s2">ability to experience 25 people being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">collective sense making organism as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.960" end="00:03:06.960" style="s2">group we weaved creatively for three</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">days through very different difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.960" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">emotions and grieving and through very</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:16.610" style="s2">complex intellectual or academic topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">while also holding to a place of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.610" end="00:03:22.710" style="s2">groundedness in our bodies where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">would do improv theatre as an activity</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.710" end="00:03:27.390" style="s2">to reconnect us to ourselves and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:30.960" style="s2">continue working as a group having</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">rituals that were prayers or meditations</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.960" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">for grounding ourselves and the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">of our bodies or and the changes</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">happening and the environment here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">Oregon where the meeting happened so all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:46.590" style="s2">of this was happening and what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:50.660" style="s2">share with you is that I was doing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:54.240" style="s2">workshop to prototype or to experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">experientially design curriculum for</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.240" end="00:03:58.800" style="s2">teaching this to people so my intention</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:00.990" style="s2">is to build a school for applied</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.800" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">cultural evolution partnering with</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.990" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">people in Costa Rica who are also</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">connected other groups all over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">world where there are collaborations</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">arising to regenerate ecosystems to grow</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:17.640" style="s2">the biodiversity of different places and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">to create communities built on economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.640" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">principles that increase health and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:23.410" style="s2">well-being for people all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">happening together</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:28.480" style="s2">and one of my tasks is to help design a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">school for applied cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.480" end="00:04:35.020" style="s2">and this workshop was the first attempt</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">to prototype curriculum to design that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.020" end="00:04:39.640" style="s2">education program and the school is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:41.620" style="s2">something that is not just graduate</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.640" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">school like masters and PhD level</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.620" end="00:04:46.260" style="s2">although we do have plans to create that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:49.180" style="s2">it&#39;s really learning across the lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.260" end="00:04:52.270" style="s2">from prenatal care and early childhood</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.180" end="00:04:55.930" style="s2">development to the way that our children</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.270" end="00:04:58.420" style="s2">learn about Ecoliteracy of the places</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.930" end="00:04:59.170" style="s2">and the cultural histories of the places</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.420" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">where they live</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.170" end="00:05:05.500" style="s2">all the way through to very advanced</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:09.790" style="s2">research that is applied to social</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.500" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">change efforts so all of this is has</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.790" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">been incubating in my own life and work</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:15.700" style="s2">for many years but also in the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.070" style="s2">many others that I will collaborate with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.700" end="00:05:20.020" style="s2">and I just want to share with you that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.070" end="00:05:24.040" style="s2">this workshop is not the only one will -</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.020" end="00:05:27.700" style="s2">I&#39;m already planning to organize at</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.040" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">least one more this year and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.700" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">another one in the spring that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:35.920" style="s2">in Costa Rica the one later this year</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">will be here in Oregon again so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:40.660" style="s2">more people can experience this</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:43.780" style="s2">transformational change and so that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.660" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">can figure out how do we teach the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.780" end="00:05:50.200" style="s2">management of complexity in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">unprecedented global change so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.200" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">excited I&#39;m very sober I&#39;m very solemn</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:05:59.140" style="s2">the experience was very grounding and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.220" end="00:06:01.510" style="s2">dealt with some pain we had one</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.140" end="00:06:04.060" style="s2">participant during a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.510" end="00:06:06.850" style="s2">powerful ritual who experienced</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:08.590" style="s2">vicarious trauma and luckily we had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.850" end="00:06:11.020" style="s2">therapist who was in the group who was</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.590" end="00:06:13.450" style="s2">able to help that person to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.020" end="00:06:16.210" style="s2">the grief that overwhelmed them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.450" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">this is very very difficult stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.210" end="00:06:24.070" style="s2">this is the work of culture design and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">I&#39;m very inspired and hopeful about what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:27.910" style="s2">we can do together so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:31.030" style="s2">share this with you as a little update</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.910" end="00:06:33.100" style="s2">and let you know that we are working</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">toward bigger things and this is just</p>
