<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">livestream on the Dark Horse podcast i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:19.890" style="s2">brett weinstein i am sitting with dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">heather hang to my right and we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">going to discuss a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:23.850" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">some of them directly related to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">coab in nineteen crisis but many of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">taking a step back and looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">bigger picture we thought we would start</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">today we have had a history of starting</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">with Corrections I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">explicit correction this is this time</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">but I did have an addendum that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">to make to something I said last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">the addendum is this I said on the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">live stream I in fact made a not so</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">polite request of our female viewers</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">that they I think the way I put it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">stop sleeping with assholes and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">was that that would make the world a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">better place and I still believe that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">that is a an important ingredient but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:07.320" style="s2">was quite incomplete the fact is there</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">is a another side to that coin which</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.320" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">involves men ceasing to focus on getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">lucky without commitment that would also</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">make the world a better place</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">so at some level this delves into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">discussion that you and I have had among</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">other places we had a discussion related</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">to this on the Joe Rogan program and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">involves two main ingredients basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">in some it is a renegotiation of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">deal between male and female something</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">an alternative to the naive proposal</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">that we see in many places that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">effectively men and women are the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">but for some kind of patriarchal force</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">that imposes difference on us and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">obviously evolutionary nonsense you said</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">it with a straight face though well done</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">I did actually I do a lot of the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">hilarious stuff with a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">straight face I&#39;ve noticed I have begun</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">on Twitter to end my ironic comments</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">with an emoji because I&#39;m not really an</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">emoji kind of guy so people can tell I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:13.190" style="s2">kidding if there&#39;s an emoji anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:16.490" style="s2">point is it is time</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.190" end="00:02:18.710" style="s2">because so much about our situation has</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.490" end="00:02:20.750" style="s2">changed from the historical past where</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.710" end="00:02:23.540" style="s2">our original deal between male and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.750" end="00:02:25.160" style="s2">female were was negotiated it is time</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.540" end="00:02:27.410" style="s2">for us to revise that deal in light of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.160" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">the modern world that we live in how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.410" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">do that is a more complex matter so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s specifically what you&#39;re alluding</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:41.420" style="s2">to is some of the novelty of our modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.520" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">existence novelty which is changing at</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.420" end="00:02:46.700" style="s2">an ever more rapid rate something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:49.850" style="s2">we have come to call hyper novelty and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:52.370" style="s2">indeed this is exactly the focus broadly</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.850" end="00:02:52.820" style="s2">of our book which will be out in about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.370" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.820" end="00:02:57.550" style="s2">so hunter-gatherers guide to the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">century explores how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.550" end="00:03:01.970" style="s2">evolutionary beings with a greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">ability to respond quickly to change</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.970" end="00:03:07.310" style="s2">than any other species that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:09.140" style="s2">us with more in the software realm that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.310" end="00:03:11.960" style="s2">is driving us than in the hardware than</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.140" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">is true of any other species how it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.960" end="00:03:20.270" style="s2">that we can persist and indeed be robust</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">in the face of such change so one of one</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.270" end="00:03:24.020" style="s2">of the chapters I think last time we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:26.270" style="s2">alluded to one of the chapters being</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.020" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">about food one of them is also about sex</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.270" end="00:03:31.730" style="s2">and gender another is about relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:34.520" style="s2">and parenting and indeed obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.730" end="00:03:36.370" style="s2">piece of advice that says you know half</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.520" end="00:03:39.050" style="s2">the population you need to do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">misses the other half of the population</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.050" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">and for almost all such prescriptions</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">there is something that that both men</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:47.959" style="s2">and women could be doing yeah so for</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:49.910" style="s2">those who are scratching their heads</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.959" end="00:03:51.620" style="s2">over what we mean by novelty and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.910" end="00:03:54.500" style="s2">effect it might be having just take the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.620" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">following example the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.500" end="00:04:00.650" style="s2">technological birth control that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">highly effective changes the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.650" end="00:04:07.010" style="s2">spectrum of risks associated with sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:08.900" style="s2">dramatically especially for women who in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.010" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">a past era without reliable birth</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.900" end="00:04:14.810" style="s2">control would have faced a situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:18.080" style="s2">where if they had sex with a guy who was</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.810" end="00:04:20.299" style="s2">not ready to commit or in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.080" end="00:04:22.789" style="s2">commit could easily end up stuck with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.299" end="00:04:23.710" style="s2">child that they needed to raise alone so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.789" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.710" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">for were psychologically constructed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">resist that hazard at all costs to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.820" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">less interested women are</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">psychologically constructed as you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">to be less interested in casual sex and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">to be more coy to use one of the words</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">that tends to be bandied about in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">evolutionary circles so now that women</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.580" style="s2">are in a position to control their their</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:51.850" style="s2">reproductive output through</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:54.100" style="s2">technological means that spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.850" end="00:04:56.289" style="s2">hazards is altered but what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.100" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">inherently altered is the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.289" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">male and female that goes along with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">sexual game as it were and so figuring</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:07.750" style="s2">out how to retool our our psychological</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:10.690" style="s2">apparatus in as much as possible for</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.750" end="00:05:13.630" style="s2">modern realities and how to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.690" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">ourselves as consequences of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.630" end="00:05:16.750" style="s2">in an environment we no longer live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:18.520" style="s2">because to some extent some of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.750" end="00:05:21.370" style="s2">things are not psychologically easily</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.520" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">altered and therefore coming to grips</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.370" end="00:05:26.110" style="s2">with what we&#39;ve been handed and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.539" style="s2">out how to marshal it usefully in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.110" end="00:05:30.940" style="s2">modern era is kind of the key to being a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.539" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">modern human ok before we leave this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.940" end="00:05:35.889" style="s2">topic there let&#39;s not leave with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:38.500" style="s2">impression that being an asshole is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.889" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">male strategy in human history right as</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.500" end="00:05:43.270" style="s2">as we&#39;ve talked about elsewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:45.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll continue to talk about we view it</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.270" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">as there being effectively three</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.760" end="00:05:49.960" style="s2">strategies three male strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:52.900" style="s2">have been effective although at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.960" end="00:05:55.479" style="s2">one of them is totally horrific right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.900" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">one strategy that males have used to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.479" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">their genes into the future has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">forced copulation or rape and no one</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:04.449" style="s2">condones that it&#39;s not okay but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.720" style="s2">other two one of them is this you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.449" end="00:06:09.340" style="s2">broadly speaking like ad strategy the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.720" end="00:06:10.810" style="s2">asshole strategy to use your language</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.340" end="00:06:12.909" style="s2">from before they&#39;ll love them and leave</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.810" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">them you know all of this looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.909" end="00:06:16.539" style="s2">one-night stands looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.159" style="s2">opportunities to impregnate someone and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.539" end="00:06:21.419" style="s2">then have nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.159" end="00:06:24.340" style="s2">resulting child but of course as we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">emerging as most of the viewers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.340" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">listeners here do from from cultures in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">which monogamy is a cultural norm and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:36.729" style="s2">for most of us a cultural value there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:39.819" style="s2">a third male strategy which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.729" end="00:06:41.469" style="s2">lovely and which very I don&#39;t know that</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.189" end="00:06:57.240" style="s2">capable of mailing a complex podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.620" end="00:06:59.139" style="s2">like this one yes so totally unforeseen</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.240" end="00:07:00.819" style="s2">consequences of the delightful sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.139" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve got him laughing back there now so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.819" end="00:07:04.809" style="s2">that&#39;s good our technical help is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">laughing but I would say actually maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.809" end="00:07:11.710" style="s2">we can move in the direction of a useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:14.979" style="s2">outgrowth of this kind of viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.710" end="00:07:17.559" style="s2">which is being an asshole is a male</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.979" end="00:07:17.860" style="s2">strategy so long as there is a niche for</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.559" end="00:07:19.419" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.860" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">at the point that it is no longer a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.419" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">productive strategy it won&#39;t be one</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:25.719" style="s2">anymore and so the whole reason that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.379" end="00:07:27.909" style="s2">gave the obnoxious piece of advice that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.719" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">I gave in the last live stream I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.909" end="00:07:32.139" style="s2">think it&#39;s about just minutes oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:34.689" style="s2">deliberately of not okay so I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.139" end="00:07:36.520" style="s2">with its level of obnoxiousness but</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.689" end="00:07:39.219" style="s2">anyway the point is look we are all</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.520" end="00:07:43.649" style="s2">creating a landscape of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.219" end="00:07:46.719" style="s2">for our competitors and our partners and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.649" end="00:07:48.310" style="s2">creating a better landscape that rewards</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.719" end="00:07:50.379" style="s2">strategies that we want to see and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.310" end="00:07:52.749" style="s2">doesn&#39;t provide sustenance to strategies</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.379" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to see is exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.749" end="00:07:57.249" style="s2">ought to be doing and amazingly enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:08:00.009" style="s2">it&#39;s the very same thing we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.249" end="00:08:01.659" style="s2">do with this virus that has spread</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.009" end="00:08:02.669" style="s2">across the world as we&#39;re trying to deny</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.659" end="00:08:06.789" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.669" end="00:08:09.580" style="s2">opportunities and to effectively Corral</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.789" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">it by not giving it the conduits between</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.580" end="00:08:13.899" style="s2">here and there and you and me and all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:16.300" style="s2">that that it seems to have found that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.899" end="00:08:18.610" style="s2">right we would like to deny all their</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:21.729" style="s2">basest instincts and for a virus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.610" end="00:08:23.439" style="s2">entirely basest instincts and so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.729" end="00:08:26.199" style="s2">to corral it into being less virulent</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.439" end="00:08:28.870" style="s2">and having and you know having an ro of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.199" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">less than one and I&#39;m not familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.870" end="00:08:34.060" style="s2">enough for the R sub T that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:36.130" style="s2">were talking about last time but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.060" end="00:08:38.469" style="s2">if the math is similar you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.130" end="00:08:43.180" style="s2">these methods of transmission we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.469" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">reduce them and and create pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.180" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">that we can live with as opposed to only</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">die with great pathogens we can live</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:51.310" style="s2">with to the extent we&#39;ve got them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.050" style="s2">not create pathways for pathogens we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.310" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2">can&#39;t live with and as long as we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.050" end="00:08:56.589" style="s2">the topic I would just point out same</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.610" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">logic applies economically and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.589" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">politically you see the strategies for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:02.860" style="s2">which there is a niche it makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2">to get overly upset about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.860" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">critter happens to have exploited and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.589" end="00:09:09.010" style="s2">innovated in that niche if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:11.560" style="s2">want to see the behavior for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.010" end="00:09:13.480" style="s2">political corruption it has to be more</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.560" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">costly than it is beneficial at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:16.839" style="s2">point political corruption is more</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:19.029" style="s2">costly than it is profitable you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.839" end="00:09:21.820" style="s2">see it so if you want to if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.029" end="00:09:25.960" style="s2">prevent it that&#39;s the way to do it good</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.820" end="00:09:28.779" style="s2">all right on to our next topic I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.960" end="00:09:30.760" style="s2">you were going to launch us here yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.779" end="00:09:34.660" style="s2">was looking we have done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.760" end="00:09:36.490" style="s2">troubleshooting this week so I am maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.660" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2">not as ensconced in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.490" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">literature that has emerged as I might</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">have been but I have seen some comments</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2">that caused me to think there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:47.710" style="s2">place we need to return to and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:51.520" style="s2">particular I saw several comments one</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.710" end="00:09:56.920" style="s2">that struggled my caught my attention</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.520" end="00:10:00.190" style="s2">very precipitously was a comment by</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.920" end="00:10:02.650" style="s2">somebody who had had Kovac 19 had</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.190" end="00:10:04.660" style="s2">recovered or was in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2">recovering still finds themselves very</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.660" end="00:10:11.650" style="s2">compromised in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">respiration and saw my comment that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.650" end="00:10:17.950" style="s2">effectively the damage done by these</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:20.980" style="s2">pathogens gives a person a giant shove</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.950" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">in the direction of death and he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.980" end="00:10:27.310" style="s2">lamenting the fact that maybe this meant</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">that something very serious had occurred</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.310" end="00:10:31.630" style="s2">from which there was no escape its</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">emerges from the conversation about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.630" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">the binary idea that you&#39;re dead or your</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">perfect is is wrongheaded and we should</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:44.140" style="s2">be adding nuance to that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:46.270" style="s2">yeah or I would say you are sick or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.140" end="00:10:50.260" style="s2">are recovered is the place where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.270" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">binary is particularly misleading so let</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.260" end="00:10:54.310" style="s2">me step back a second and say that what</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:57.139" style="s2">we&#39;re about to talk about emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.310" end="00:10:58.759" style="s2">work I did a long time ago on</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.139" end="00:11:01.160" style="s2">telomere some of you will be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.759" end="00:11:06.559" style="s2">that work it was discussed extensively</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.160" end="00:11:08.779" style="s2">on Eric his podcast the portal episode</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.559" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">19 we talked about the telomere work and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.779" end="00:11:13.429" style="s2">what it had been and we&#39;re not gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:16.999" style="s2">deeply into it here but I will say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.429" end="00:11:19.009" style="s2">the basic model involves the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.999" end="00:11:20.629" style="s2">on the ends of our chromosomes you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.009" end="00:11:22.730" style="s2">remember from wherever you learned about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.629" end="00:11:25.639" style="s2">chromosomes that our chromosomes are</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.730" end="00:11:28.970" style="s2">linear they are a line of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.639" end="00:11:31.939" style="s2">information and at the ends both ends of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.970" end="00:11:33.980" style="s2">a chromosome you have a repetitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.939" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">sequence that it&#39;s not a gene it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.980" end="00:11:37.730" style="s2">contain information about how to make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:39.619" style="s2">protein or anything like that it is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.730" end="00:11:41.899" style="s2">a repetitive sequence that has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.619" end="00:11:44.149" style="s2">particular number of repeats that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.899" end="00:11:47.499" style="s2">called the telomere and that number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.149" end="00:11:51.019" style="s2">repeats it happens in creatures like us</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.499" end="00:11:52.939" style="s2">decreases every time a cell divides now</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.019" end="00:11:55.059" style="s2">cells basically have three reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.939" end="00:11:57.559" style="s2">divide they could divide as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.059" end="00:11:59.629" style="s2">your growth you&#39;re getting bigger you</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.559" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">need more cells than you&#39;ve got it could</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.629" end="00:12:03.860" style="s2">divide as a result of maintenance where</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:05.869" style="s2">some cell is replaced by another cell</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.860" end="00:12:07.959" style="s2">that does the same job or it could</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.869" end="00:12:10.189" style="s2">happen when you have a need for repair</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.959" end="00:12:12.230" style="s2">so if you&#39;ve damaged something and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.189" end="00:12:14.540" style="s2">need to grow more you know skin or</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.230" end="00:12:16.429" style="s2">whatever to fill in a cut that you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:19.249" style="s2">all of those things will cause cells to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.429" end="00:12:23.569" style="s2">divide and in almost all of your tissues</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.249" end="00:12:25.910" style="s2">a loss of telomere so that loss of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.569" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">telomeres what I worked on and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.910" end="00:12:33.129" style="s2">upshot of that work is that the telomere</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">loss which appears to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.129" end="00:12:38.059" style="s2">what we colloquially call aging what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:40.220" style="s2">scientifically call senescence that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.059" end="00:12:43.220" style="s2">the degradation of your function with</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:46.249" style="s2">age that that loss appears to be an</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.220" end="00:12:49.939" style="s2">adaptation and the adaptation is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.249" end="00:12:53.869" style="s2">preventing tumors so we have growths</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.939" end="00:12:57.169" style="s2">where a cell has gotten has become</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.869" end="00:13:00.169" style="s2">broken as a result of mutation some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.169" end="00:13:01.939" style="s2">those ways that a cell can become broken</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.169" end="00:13:04.579" style="s2">would cause it to reproduce without</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.939" end="00:13:06.319" style="s2">reason if it reproduces with that reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.579" end="00:13:08.030" style="s2">long enough almost no matter where in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.319" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">your body a cell is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.030" end="00:13:12.020" style="s2">will crowd out something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:14.210" style="s2">depending on and you&#39;ll die so you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.020" end="00:13:17.090" style="s2">creature like us that might have 30</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.210" end="00:13:18.950" style="s2">trillion cells every one of those cells</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.090" end="00:13:22.220" style="s2">that is capable of replacing itself is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.950" end="00:13:23.840" style="s2">also capable of duplicating too much and</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.420" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">just point out even if we&#39;ve figured out</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.980" end="00:15:14.150" style="s2">how to do it for the body you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.220" style="s2">problem with the way the brain functions</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.150" end="00:15:18.920" style="s2">and the failure of the brain has very</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.220" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">little to do with the inability of cells</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.920" end="00:15:21.450" style="s2">to replace themselves because the cells</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">in quest</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.450" end="00:15:25.050" style="s2">our neurons and a neuron may be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">connected to a thousand other neurons so</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.050" end="00:15:29.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not the number of cells you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">doing brain work it&#39;s the connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.370" end="00:15:34.140" style="s2">of them and so how that connectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.060" style="s2">deployed and lost over time and all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.140" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">that that&#39;s a whole different problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.060" end="00:15:41.640" style="s2">and we really have no idea how to even</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:43.830" style="s2">begin to revise the brain to to make you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.640" end="00:15:45.780" style="s2">live longer in terms of your body we</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.830" end="00:15:47.580" style="s2">actually know right now how to get you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.780" end="00:15:49.580" style="s2">to live longer than you will currently</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.580" end="00:15:52.380" style="s2">live and it involves reducing damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.580" end="00:15:53.730" style="s2">right this actually works we are but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.380" end="00:15:55.590" style="s2">you&#39;re not talking about extending the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.730" end="00:15:58.770" style="s2">life of the body beyond 120 years right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.590" end="00:16:03.390" style="s2">that is a fool&#39;s errand I would say at</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.770" end="00:16:07.080" style="s2">this point we can make you younger</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.390" end="00:16:10.530" style="s2">longer and we can make you healthier and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.080" end="00:16:12.060" style="s2">we can get you closer to 120 it involves</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.530" end="00:16:15.900" style="s2">reducing the amount of damage that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.060" end="00:16:18.780" style="s2">suffer and that has implications for</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.900" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">this commenter who was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.780" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">grappling with the implications of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:26.430" style="s2">disease that he is faced and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:30.090" style="s2">beyond that so what I was hoping to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.430" end="00:16:34.170" style="s2">to was I should say we have been living</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.090" end="00:16:37.710" style="s2">with this model of telomere based aging</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.170" end="00:16:40.530" style="s2">since nineteen ninety eight or nine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.710" end="00:16:43.350" style="s2">it sounds right something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.530" end="00:16:45.660" style="s2">that means that we because we believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.350" end="00:16:48.510" style="s2">that this is a correct description of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.660" end="00:16:51.150" style="s2">why the human body grows feeble and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.510" end="00:16:56.060" style="s2">inefficient with age not humans all</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.150" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">mammals birds complex animals as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.060" end="00:17:00.810" style="s2">living with this model we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">grapple with the everyday questions of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.810" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">what to do and what not to do and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:09.720" style="s2">anyway we&#39;ve learned a lot about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:13.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like to look through that lens and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.720" end="00:17:16.740" style="s2">I think what I&#39;m hoping is that people</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.860" end="00:17:19.160" style="s2">will move past just seeing the downside</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.740" end="00:17:22.530" style="s2">of this oh my god I&#39;ve suffered damage</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.160" end="00:17:29.720" style="s2">and start thinking about the upside of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.530" end="00:17:33.240" style="s2">understanding this so how to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.720" end="00:17:34.590" style="s2">imagine for a second that the grave is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.240" end="00:17:38.039" style="s2">place we</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.590" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">something like a magnetic pole and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.039" end="00:17:44.490" style="s2">that magnetic pole is very weak when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:48.659" style="s2">are young and healthy and it grows</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.490" end="00:17:52.289" style="s2">stronger the older you get right the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.659" end="00:17:56.580" style="s2">grave is pulling you towards it and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.289" end="00:17:58.860" style="s2">you suffer some kind of body wide damage</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.580" end="00:18:01.830" style="s2">you get a giant shove in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:03.749" style="s2">of that magnet doesn&#39;t necessarily push</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.830" end="00:18:05.610" style="s2">you close enough to the magnet that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.749" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">fall into the grave but it pushes you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.610" end="00:18:12.509" style="s2">closer to it now that leaves you with an</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:14.220" style="s2">opportunity which is well I&#39;m not happy</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.509" end="00:18:16.769" style="s2">that I&#39;m closer to that magnet than I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.220" end="00:18:20.129" style="s2">was but I can take actions so that my</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.769" end="00:18:23.129" style="s2">motion in that direction slows down to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.129" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">compensate and this has many</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.129" end="00:18:29.669" style="s2">implications for how one views health I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:33.690" style="s2">must say I have been scratching my head</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.669" end="00:18:35.909" style="s2">for decades now wondering why we look at</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.369" end="00:18:46.259" style="s2">was sick and it cost me two weeks now</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.070" end="00:22:08.460" style="s2">over-the-counter drugs yes so let&#39;s talk</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.790" end="00:22:18.700" style="s2">traveling in the tropics and we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.750" end="00:22:21.490" style="s2">taking the kinds of drugs that one takes</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.000" end="00:22:53.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned it feel pretty compelled</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.320" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">in mmm what was it 2013 playing ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">with bunch of our students that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:07.900" style="s2">that rupture was almost certainly at</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.010" end="00:23:17.680" style="s2">course the common theme there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">Ultimate Frisbee but history which is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.680" end="00:23:22.900" style="s2">stopped playing at this point because</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously a bit dangerous but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.900" end="00:23:28.330" style="s2">any case we learned too late that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:30.130" style="s2">cipro that we had taken thinking that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.330" end="00:23:33.970" style="s2">was pretty close to cost-free just</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.130" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">simply wasn&#39;t um we have learned similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.970" end="00:23:40.990" style="s2">things about benadryl benadryl function</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:43.990" style="s2">is differently but it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.990" end="00:23:47.290" style="s2">closely related to dementia and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.990" end="00:23:49.060" style="s2">cumulative quantity of benadryl taken</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.290" end="00:23:52.420" style="s2">over a lifetime is somewhat predictive</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.060" end="00:23:54.580" style="s2">of future dementia so that&#39;s a case</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.420" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">where again we&#39;ve learned that some drug</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.580" end="00:24:01.890" style="s2">that we thought was safe just simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">wasn&#39;t erythromycin does heart damage</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.890" end="00:24:07.620" style="s2">Natick yep and seds do heart damage so</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:10.540" style="s2">the bottom line is synthetic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.620" end="00:24:13.060" style="s2">carries a fairly strong risk</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.540" end="00:24:15.490" style="s2">of doing some kind of damage that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.060" end="00:24:17.080" style="s2">not aware of and at some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:20.280" style="s2">pushing you in the direction of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.080" end="00:24:23.610" style="s2">magnet of the grave so what about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.280" end="00:24:26.590" style="s2">woowoo seeming suggestion that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.610" end="00:24:28.540" style="s2">botanicals are safer that drugs derived</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.590" end="00:24:30.670" style="s2">from botanicals you know aspirin that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.540" end="00:24:32.740" style="s2">you can take now is certainly derived is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.670" end="00:24:35.650" style="s2">synthesized in a lab but it&#39;s derived</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.740" end="00:24:37.660" style="s2">from willow bark and you and I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.650" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">aspirin when we feel like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.660" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">take such a such a thing yeah what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">mean I&#39;m just I&#39;m gonna feed you the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:48.130" style="s2">question right so you know why why</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">aspirin and not Advil well let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.130" end="00:24:53.920" style="s2">first say there&#39;s nothing magical about</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.350" end="00:24:57.580" style="s2">botanicals there&#39;s certainly innumerable</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.920" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">toxins created by plants generally</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.580" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">they&#39;re what&#39;s called secondary</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:04.420" style="s2">compounds which means they are compounds</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:06.970" style="s2">that have no value in the plant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.420" end="00:25:09.700" style="s2">not part of some pathway but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.970" end="00:25:12.100" style="s2">there to dissuade herbivores from eating</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.700" end="00:25:14.290" style="s2">the plant they&#39;re there as toxins and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.100" end="00:25:18.430" style="s2">fact almost all of our medicines that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.290" end="00:25:20.380" style="s2">get from plants are toxins as produced</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.430" end="00:25:24.100" style="s2">by the plant and what we do the magic of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.380" end="00:25:26.650" style="s2">these medicines is in titration and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:29.860" style="s2">is to say so here&#39;s the quick and dirty</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.650" end="00:25:31.930" style="s2">logic the plants are looking for ways to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.860" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">dissuade their herbivores many of whom</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.930" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">are mammals from eating their leaves</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">generally so they load the leaves up</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">with toxins well what&#39;s a toxin a toxin</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">is something that disrupts the function</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:46.300" style="s2">of the physiology of the animal that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:49.030" style="s2">would be eating it how do you disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.300" end="00:25:51.970" style="s2">the function well an animal is a highly</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.030" end="00:25:54.010" style="s2">complex creature with you know hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.970" end="00:25:55.780" style="s2">of chemical pathways in it disrupting</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.010" end="00:25:57.730" style="s2">any one of them will reduce its function</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.780" end="00:26:01.780" style="s2">and so in effect plants have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.730" end="00:26:04.690" style="s2">exploring animal physiology by creating</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.780" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">compounds that happened to disrupt some</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.690" end="00:26:09.100" style="s2">animals or vivir e and then amplifying</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.450" style="s2">their quantity modifying their shape</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.100" end="00:26:13.270" style="s2">whatever it is that makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.450" end="00:26:15.490" style="s2">effective we can now borrow these</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.270" end="00:26:18.670" style="s2">molecules that interfere with animal</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.490" end="00:26:21.790" style="s2">physiology and if you are if your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.670" end="00:26:23.610" style="s2">pathway is poorly regulated in the down</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.790" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">direction some plant is out</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.610" end="00:26:28.230" style="s2">they&#39;re amplifying that pathway and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.900" style="s2">can borrow that compound we can amplify</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.230" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">that pathway to the key being titration</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.900" end="00:26:36.450" style="s2">the amount so so where as sucking air</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:39.179" style="s2">and willow bark doesn&#39;t allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.450" end="00:26:42.120" style="s2">control how much what is it cell silic</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.179" end="00:26:43.620" style="s2">acid you&#39;re getting a lab can control</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.120" end="00:26:44.910" style="s2">exactly how much you&#39;re getting and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.620" end="00:26:46.860" style="s2">can know that you&#39;re taking the exact</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.910" end="00:26:48.750" style="s2">same amount as you did the last time you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.860" end="00:26:51.030" style="s2">can hope I mean we do a bad job of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.750" end="00:26:53.190" style="s2">the bottle says you know take two of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.030" end="00:26:56.190" style="s2">these every four hours for an adult but</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.190" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">adults vary a wide degree in size so it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.190" end="00:27:02.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:05.910" style="s2">know historically that massive errors</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.010" end="00:27:08.070" style="s2">have been made and again this is from an</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.910" end="00:27:09.630" style="s2">earlier live stream we did but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.070" end="00:27:13.530" style="s2">evidence that the Spanish flu pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.630" end="00:27:15.419" style="s2">was made vastly worse by aspirin why</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.530" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">because they gave quantities that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.419" end="00:27:20.580" style="s2">now be considered insane so that very</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.420" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">it was a fungus or bacteria probably a</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:34.809" style="s2">so for example benadryl widely used as a</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.250" end="00:30:51.910" style="s2">actually we ended up using that in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.230" end="00:30:53.380" style="s2">tropics where sometimes you&#39;re in very</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:09.940" style="s2">about something like melatonin is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2">melatonin likely to be safer than</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.940" end="00:31:15.370" style="s2">benadryl well I would argue it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:17.380" style="s2">to be safer because we know what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.370" end="00:31:19.780" style="s2">molecule it is and why it&#39;s interfering</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.380" end="00:31:21.669" style="s2">in a way that is likely you can harm</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.669" end="00:31:26.950" style="s2">harm your sleep-wake cycle rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.100" end="00:31:29.559" style="s2">contribute to some other pathway why can</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.950" end="00:31:32.169" style="s2">we say that because melatonin is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.559" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">chemical that we produce ourselves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.169" end="00:31:36.610" style="s2">a chemical involved in the way our sleep</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.610" end="00:31:42.400" style="s2">effectively hacking our sleep cycle by</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.450" end="00:31:44.380" style="s2">utilizing a molecule by introducing it</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.149" end="00:33:16.269" style="s2">so mushrooms versus LSD so and yet LSD</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.049" end="00:33:18.549" style="s2">is derived from ergo which is a fungus</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.269" end="00:33:22.299" style="s2">but and it&#39;s and it&#39;s usually available</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.339" end="00:34:18.790" style="s2">real setback and I think as you get more</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.629" end="00:34:23.079" style="s2">comfortable with this model what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.790" end="00:34:25.300" style="s2">realize is that this is like a bank</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.079" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">account a bank account that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.300" end="00:34:29.260" style="s2">spending for you you know at the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:31.210" style="s2">that you&#39;re wise enough to think this</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.260" end="00:34:32.740" style="s2">way you&#39;re already in adults you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.210" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">spending it on growth it&#39;s maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.740" end="00:34:36.280" style="s2">and repair anything you spend on repair</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:37.720" style="s2">is not left from maintenance you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.280" end="00:34:42.849" style="s2">borrowing that from your future</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.720" end="00:34:46.060" style="s2">so tuning in on those things which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.849" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">creating damage and learning to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.060" end="00:34:49.869" style="s2">them so that you have more to spend on</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">maintenance effectively you can maintain</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.869" end="00:34:55.780" style="s2">yourself in a more youthful way longer</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:59.079" style="s2">into the future is just simply the smart</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.780" end="00:35:01.660" style="s2">thing to do and so at the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.079" end="00:35:04.810" style="s2">getting a bit personal I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.660" end="00:35:08.140" style="s2">about some things that I have discovered</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.810" end="00:35:10.410" style="s2">far too late about myself that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.140" end="00:35:13.869" style="s2">are useful but I wish I had known them</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.410" end="00:35:15.370" style="s2">far earlier in my life so the first one</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.869" end="00:35:18.460" style="s2">has to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.370" end="00:35:21.670" style="s2">I had a case of asthma that dogged me</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.460" end="00:35:24.670" style="s2">for my whole adult life and we had tried</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.670" end="00:35:25.960" style="s2">virtually everything to address it we</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.670" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">had gotten all kinds of advice from</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.960" end="00:35:32.260" style="s2">doctors we had been told I was allergic</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">to caps which I probably am but not all</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.260" end="00:35:38.380" style="s2">cats right cats differ we&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:40.150" style="s2">that it was you know dust mites in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.380" end="00:35:41.710" style="s2">bedding we&#39;ve been told all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.150" end="00:35:43.900" style="s2">things and we&#39;d done all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.710" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">we actually took the forced air heating</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.900" end="00:35:47.590" style="s2">system out of our prior house with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.180" end="00:35:50.980" style="s2">thought that it was transmitting dust</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.590" end="00:35:53.350" style="s2">that I was sensitive to and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.980" end="00:35:57.310" style="s2">when none of this really worked</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.350" end="00:35:59.740" style="s2">I noticed somewhere on the internet that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.310" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">people were reporting that they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.740" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">having a reaction to gluten that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.930" end="00:36:07.420" style="s2">causing respiratory illness basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">causing asthma and my thought at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.420" end="00:36:12.490" style="s2">time was no way at the time I really</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:15.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even a believer in gluten</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.490" end="00:36:16.900" style="s2">allergies as a widespread problem but</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.100" end="00:36:19.720" style="s2">since we had tried everything else</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.900" end="00:36:22.090" style="s2">I decided what could it hurt to take</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.720" end="00:36:25.420" style="s2">gluten out of my diet and see what</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.090" end="00:36:27.490" style="s2">happened and it didn&#39;t happen right away</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.420" end="00:36:29.800" style="s2">it took a couple of weeks but if I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.490" end="00:36:32.680" style="s2">eliminated gluten from my diet for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.800" end="00:36:35.560" style="s2">couple of weeks my symptoms got entirely</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.680" end="00:36:37.360" style="s2">better and then if I reintroduced it to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.560" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">my diet they went right back to where</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.360" end="00:36:41.140" style="s2">they were and I went to the doctor and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:43.660" style="s2">said can you test me for gluten allergy</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.140" end="00:36:45.910" style="s2">it actually came back negative and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.660" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">said what does that mean the doctor said</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.910" end="00:36:49.510" style="s2">actually we see that a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:52.120" style="s2">people are negative but they you should</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.510" end="00:36:53.770" style="s2">go with wool if it&#39;s effective to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.120" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">limonade it from your diet ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.770" end="00:36:58.810" style="s2">test what I later discovered a great</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:01.990" style="s2">doctor yeah what a rare and great doctor</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.810" end="00:37:03.490" style="s2">doctor response he was great doctor dr.</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.990" end="00:37:07.120" style="s2">Scott thank you</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.490" end="00:37:09.970" style="s2">so what I discovered later was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.120" end="00:37:12.670" style="s2">probably in my case it&#39;s not gluten</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.970" end="00:37:16.030" style="s2">what I discovered quite accidentally was</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.670" end="00:37:18.820" style="s2">that my sensitivity is to wheat there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.030" end="00:37:21.730" style="s2">some molecule in wheat now the only way</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.820" end="00:37:22.990" style="s2">I can avoid wheat is to you know if I go</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.730" end="00:37:24.940" style="s2">into a restaurant I say have a wheat</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.990" end="00:37:27.250" style="s2">allergy they scratch their heads if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.940" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">say I have a gluten allergy many of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.250" end="00:37:30.460" style="s2">know what to do so I talk as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:32.620" style="s2">I have a lutein allergy but I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.460" end="00:37:34.690" style="s2">certain that I do not both on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.620" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">that the test comes back negative and on</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.690" end="00:37:40.180" style="s2">the basis that Bombay Sapphire gin is</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:41.860" style="s2">certified gluten-free and yet I have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.180" end="00:37:43.780" style="s2">same reaction to it that I have if</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.860" end="00:37:46.660" style="s2">somebody gives me soy sauce with wheat</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.780" end="00:37:48.430" style="s2">in it for example so what is always</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.660" end="00:37:51.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve inadvertently run a number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.430" end="00:37:53.050" style="s2">natural experiments where sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.550" end="00:37:55.570" style="s2">know and sometimes you don&#39;t but I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.050" end="00:37:57.130" style="s2">know that you&#39;ve gotten something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.570" end="00:37:59.650" style="s2">you&#39;ve ingested something that has wheat</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.130" end="00:38:00.460" style="s2">in it and if I know and you don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.650" end="00:38:05.220" style="s2">already happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.460" end="00:38:07.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t tell you and I didn&#39;t at first</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.220" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">because you and I both were interested</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.480" end="00:38:10.330" style="s2">to know if there was any chance that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:12.370" style="s2">were tricking yourself no you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.330" end="00:38:15.210" style="s2">fooling your sufferer and no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.370" end="00:38:18.040" style="s2">yep you get that you get the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.210" end="00:38:20.590" style="s2">every time and when we were on study</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.040" end="00:38:22.450" style="s2">abroad in Ecuador where it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.590" end="00:38:24.310" style="s2">difficult to avoid wheat completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.450" end="00:38:26.920" style="s2">there&#39;s just not enough awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.310" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">where wheat is and isn&#39;t so you end up</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.920" end="00:38:30.970" style="s2">getting dosed with wheat every so often</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.620" style="s2">just that of course and we had two other</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.970" end="00:38:34.660" style="s2">two students as well who are very</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.620" end="00:38:37.300" style="s2">sensitive to the three of you yes the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.660" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">three of us would suddenly have the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.300" end="00:38:40.510" style="s2">reaction we&#39;d had some meal together</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:41.560" style="s2">somewhere and suddenly we&#39;re all like oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.510" end="00:38:43.120" style="s2">there it is again</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.560" end="00:38:45.010" style="s2">right so anyway all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.120" end="00:38:48.070" style="s2">begin to tell a pretty clear story about</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.010" end="00:38:49.990" style="s2">in my case wheat exposure even tiny</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.070" end="00:38:55.530" style="s2">amounts of weed exposure are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.990" end="00:39:00.490" style="s2">to trigger it but the bottom line is my</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.530" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">lung symptoms cleared up I would say 90%</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.490" end="00:39:04.870" style="s2">if I just simply was completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.250" end="00:39:07.950" style="s2">religious about keeping wheat out of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.870" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">diet and that was you know enough I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.950" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2">basically it reduced my lung symptoms to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:19.780" style="s2">a absolutely minor annoyance what I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:22.330" style="s2">found more recently is that the minor</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.780" end="00:39:25.420" style="s2">annoyance actually goes away if I</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.330" end="00:39:28.360" style="s2">maintain my weight below a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.420" end="00:39:30.430" style="s2">seventy pounds right so that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.360" end="00:39:32.530" style="s2">easy number for me to hit but if I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.430" end="00:39:36.070" style="s2">get below a hundred and seventy pounds I</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.530" end="00:39:39.430" style="s2">can go all winter with no cough</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.070" end="00:39:42.580" style="s2">whatsoever right and so my suspicion is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.430" end="00:39:45.100" style="s2">this has to do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.580" end="00:39:48.300" style="s2">some kind of cytokine storm if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.100" end="00:39:51.910" style="s2">basically an inflammation issue that was</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.300" end="00:39:53.830" style="s2">body wide in the presence of wheat was</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.910" end="00:39:57.310" style="s2">greatly reduced by the elimination of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.830" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">wheat and can be further reduced by my</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.310" end="00:40:03.250" style="s2">maintaining my weight at that level so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:06.820" style="s2">the advice I would give is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.250" end="00:40:08.470" style="s2">figure out you know this may not apply</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.820" end="00:40:11.950" style="s2">to you at all the things that work for</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.470" end="00:40:14.200" style="s2">me but you are a system that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.950" end="00:40:16.060" style="s2">tune into you can figure out what in</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.200" end="00:40:18.100" style="s2">your diet might be triggering you by</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.060" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">eliminating those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.100" end="00:40:24.490" style="s2">candidates and seeing what changes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">then introducing them back in and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.490" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">if you revert one thing you haven&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.380" end="00:40:30.220" style="s2">though is that for many of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:32.320" style="s2">allergies I don&#39;t think we have time</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.220" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">today to talk about what we think why we</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.320" end="00:40:36.250" style="s2">think that there is such an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.330" style="s2">particular kinds of these things but</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.250" end="00:40:39.790" style="s2">that for many of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.330" end="00:40:42.310" style="s2">you can&#39;t just reduce the amount of say</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.790" end="00:40:43.870" style="s2">wheat in your diet to ninety-five five</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.310" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">percent of what it used to be which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.870" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">honestly what most people do when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:50.230" style="s2">go on what they claim our elimination</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:52.090" style="s2">diets they end up having a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.230" end="00:40:53.560" style="s2">something and because their symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.090" end="00:40:56.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t cleared yet anyway they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.560" end="00:40:57.940" style="s2">notice and so you know people will say</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.410" end="00:40:59.980" style="s2">well I tried an elimination diet and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.940" end="00:41:01.510" style="s2">nothing got better so I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.980" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not any of those things that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.510" end="00:41:06.610" style="s2">eliminated but you really have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:08.290" style="s2">zero to zero to completely clear it from</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.610" end="00:41:10.930" style="s2">your system or else your body is going</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.290" end="00:41:13.240" style="s2">to be if it is allergic it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:15.730" style="s2">sending up a response you need to get to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.240" end="00:41:17.890" style="s2">zero you need to figure out where there</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.730" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">might be a leak that you&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.890" end="00:41:25.120" style="s2">like soy sauce until you get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:27.340" style="s2">that for some reason soy sauce is almost</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.120" end="00:41:29.620" style="s2">almost ubiquitously has wheat unless you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.340" end="00:41:31.750" style="s2">specifically sourced wheat free soy</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.620" end="00:41:32.920" style="s2">sauce you know you&#39;ve got to eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.750" end="00:41:35.500" style="s2">all of those things and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.920" end="00:41:39.430" style="s2">to give it time for whatever cytokine</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.500" end="00:41:42.190" style="s2">pathway has been triggered to to turn</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.430" end="00:41:43.930" style="s2">itself off in order to detect what your</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.190" end="00:41:46.750" style="s2">physiology is like on the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.930" end="00:41:48.910" style="s2">you may well find wheats not an issue</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.750" end="00:41:50.920" style="s2">for you but something else might be and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.910" end="00:41:53.650" style="s2">anyway that the larger point really</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.920" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">isn&#39;t about wheat it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.650" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">signal-to-noise ratios we live in a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:01.930" style="s2">we are complex critters our diets are</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.910" style="s2">more complex than any ancestor would</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.930" end="00:42:05.470" style="s2">have faced that is to say they source</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.910" end="00:42:06.700" style="s2">things from all over the world one</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.470" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">person might be fine with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.700" end="00:42:10.599" style="s2">ingredient you may not be fine you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:12.760" style="s2">know but you have to get the noise level</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.599" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">down so you can begin to detect the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.760" end="00:42:18.549" style="s2">signals once you detect the signals then</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">the point is look the game is simple you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.549" end="00:42:24.549" style="s2">want to reduce damage if you do damage</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">to one organ over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.549" end="00:42:28.510" style="s2">again if you damage your liver every</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:31.210" style="s2">night with too much alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.510" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">well then eventually you might push your</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.210" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">liver towards the grave if your liver</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">dies that&#39;s cirrhosis of the liver right</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:39.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens your liver is dying</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s exhausted a lifetime&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.130" end="00:42:43.690" style="s2">worth of repair capacity and you can die</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.500" end="00:42:47.319" style="s2">from that if you can manage to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.690" end="00:42:49.930" style="s2">liver functional then you won&#39;t die of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.319" end="00:42:52.599" style="s2">that particular malady but if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.930" end="00:42:54.130" style="s2">job that forced you to repetitively do</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.599" end="00:42:56.980" style="s2">one thing over and over again if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.130" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">were using a pickaxe mining coal or</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.980" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">something like that your arms would age</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.559" style="s2">faster than the rest of you because</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.750" style="s2">their capacity to maintain themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.559" end="00:43:06.309" style="s2">would be exhausted early now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.750" end="00:43:08.200" style="s2">probably not going to die of feeble arms</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.309" end="00:43:11.589" style="s2">but you&#39;ll have arthritis and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.200" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">crippling to you so realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.589" end="00:43:17.859" style="s2">damages the enemy the damage is another</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:20.410" style="s2">way of speaking about the magnetic force</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.859" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">of the grave and that you know to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.410" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">person who made the comment about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:27.819" style="s2">case of kovat 19 he just recovered from</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:31.210" style="s2">yep you probably did get a shove towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.819" end="00:43:34.029" style="s2">the grave how big a shove nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.210" end="00:43:36.339" style="s2">yet I really don&#39;t think we have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.029" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">data on what the damage looks like for</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.339" end="00:43:42.579" style="s2">various levels of symptomatology for</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:46.630" style="s2">this disease maybe it was a big shove</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.579" end="00:43:49.690" style="s2">maybe not but irrespective of what sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.630" end="00:43:51.700" style="s2">of shove it was the right response is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.690" end="00:43:54.430" style="s2">tune in to what kinds of damage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.700" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">doing all the time and to reduce them so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.430" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">that your rate of progress in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:44:00.819" style="s2">direction slows down and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:03.130" style="s2">definitely do so don&#39;t despair chin up</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.819" end="00:44:06.250" style="s2">yes it was a show of towards the grave</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.130" end="00:44:07.670" style="s2">but we all get them and you got unlucky</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.250" end="00:44:09.740" style="s2">this time</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.670" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s now time to take charge of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.740" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">level of damage and reduce it very good</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:22.820" style="s2">all right are we yeah you other somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:26.660" style="s2">disconnected topics that we just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.820" end="00:44:28.490" style="s2">to to talk about briefly good uh 45</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.660" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">minutes all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.490" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of a follow-up to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:36.080" style="s2">discussion that we had about the MIT</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:38.600" style="s2">subway study last time with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.080" end="00:44:40.610" style="s2">routes of transmission the subway study</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.600" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">is those of you who tuned in last time</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.610" end="00:44:47.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll remember suggested that Subway&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:49.100" style="s2">being quite packed even after shelter</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.270" end="00:44:51.470" style="s2">and place orders came down in New York</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.100" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">City seemed to be a major route of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.470" end="00:44:58.910" style="s2">transmission for SARS Cove - in New York</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:45:01.190" style="s2">City well there&#39;s a paper out called</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.910" end="00:45:04.250" style="s2">indoor transmission of SARS Cove to key</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.190" end="00:45:05.960" style="s2">on a tall 2020 which suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.250" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">indoor transmission is far more likely</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.960" end="00:45:12.530" style="s2">than outdoor and at one level that seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:14.990" style="s2">completely obvious and yet also the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.530" end="00:45:19.490" style="s2">shutting down of parks and of beaches</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.990" end="00:45:20.660" style="s2">and of skate parks and the admonition</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.450" end="00:45:30.380" style="s2">me as suggestive that people do not have</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.610" end="00:45:32.540" style="s2">a nuanced enough model here that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.380" end="00:45:34.700" style="s2">know this stays six feet away from one</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.540" end="00:45:37.010" style="s2">another has from the beginning struck me</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.700" end="00:45:39.880" style="s2">as an insane number it&#39;s clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.010" end="00:45:43.370" style="s2">enough but it&#39;s better than nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.880" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">the you know mask yourself at all times</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.370" end="00:45:47.690" style="s2">well we don&#39;t mask ourselves in our</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:50.660" style="s2">house in case some virus happens to come</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.690" end="00:45:53.120" style="s2">in the window so you know there there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.660" end="00:45:56.320" style="s2">there are going to be nuances with</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.120" end="00:45:58.610" style="s2">regard to what is the best best move so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.320" end="00:46:00.380" style="s2">from the discussion of this paper again</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.610" end="00:46:03.290" style="s2">kion and all 2020 here&#39;s a direct quote</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.380" end="00:46:05.630" style="s2">our study does not rule out outdoor</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.290" end="00:46:09.230" style="s2">transmission of the virus however among</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.319" end="00:46:34.280" style="s2">find through a combination of hospital</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.020" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">been to find that being outdoors is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.569" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">actually somewhat protective</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:51.380" style="s2">yeah they don&#39;t use that language but</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:53.210" style="s2">but I will I will go ahead and say being</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.380" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">outdoors if you&#39;re going to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.210" end="00:46:57.589" style="s2">other people at all it&#39;s going to be far</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">more protective so for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.589" end="00:47:03.829" style="s2">Portland where we live there is now one</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:06.650" style="s2">as far as I know weekly farmers market</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.829" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">open and there&#39;s all sorts of alarm that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.650" end="00:47:09.950" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing about the idea of farmers</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:11.780" style="s2">market because farmers markets are</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.950" end="00:47:13.880" style="s2">obviously often crowded places with lots</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.780" end="00:47:16.220" style="s2">of people exchanging you know money and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.880" end="00:47:21.950" style="s2">produce and such liberals go to them so</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.220" end="00:47:24.859" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of hugging oh and it&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.950" end="00:47:27.230" style="s2">more likely if people are being safe if</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.859" end="00:47:29.780" style="s2">people are keeping some distance but</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.230" end="00:47:31.490" style="s2">mostly if people are masked and if</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.780" end="00:47:34.579" style="s2">especially if we can reduce the exchange</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.030" end="00:47:56.839" style="s2">will just say that while this paper</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.859" end="00:47:59.089" style="s2">looked compelling to me it is consistent</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:59.550" style="s2">to save drowning people and they then</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.550" end="00:49:08.340" style="s2">governments and on the one hand I do get</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.740" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">it on the other hand I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.340" end="00:49:16.590" style="s2">many really important lessons of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">kovat 19 disaster is there are no adults</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.590" end="00:49:22.080" style="s2">that apparatus that is supposed to be</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.960" end="00:49:34.710" style="s2">that means we have to do our own job of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.180" end="00:49:36.780" style="s2">protecting ourselves I do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.710" end="00:49:39.540" style="s2">good governance I really believe it is</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.540" end="00:49:43.830" style="s2">also must say that to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">people fear the nanny state</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.830" end="00:49:49.290" style="s2">I think this epidemic is showing us</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.290" end="00:49:54.420" style="s2">government telling you don&#39;t go out into</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:56.520" style="s2">nature at a point when your instinct</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.420" end="00:49:58.830" style="s2">might be to do just that and then the</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.830" end="00:50:03.720" style="s2">might have even been epidemiologically</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.810" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">the right thing to do this is telling us</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.720" end="00:50:08.910" style="s2">something important the fact is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.450" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">don&#39;t need a lifeguard to enjoy a beach</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:13.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t need a lifeguard</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:15.120" style="s2">to go swimming at the beach you do need</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.050" end="00:50:17.910" style="s2">to know what it means to swim at your</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.120" end="00:50:20.310" style="s2">own risk and the fact is this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.910" end="00:50:23.670" style="s2">dangerous you and I have had incidents</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.310" end="00:50:25.320" style="s2">in our past where we have nearly drowned</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.670" end="00:50:27.030" style="s2">as a result of things we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.320" end="00:50:28.740" style="s2">understand about the places where we</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.030" end="00:50:31.880" style="s2">were encountering water it&#39;s not a small</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.740" end="00:50:35.610" style="s2">matter on the other hand if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.880" end="00:50:38.430" style="s2">recognize that beaches existed before</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.610" end="00:50:39.930" style="s2">lifeguards did people swam at them you</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.930" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">beach but if you&#39;re gonna go to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.670" end="00:50:45.900" style="s2">beach and you feel like you should go</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:47.819" style="s2">swimming figure out how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.900" end="00:50:49.890" style="s2">you enter the water such that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.819" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">discover the hazard before it gets the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.890" end="00:50:55.079" style="s2">better of you we are living in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:56.849" style="s2">unprecedented times and it is as if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.079" end="00:51:00.299" style="s2">have all gone to a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.849" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">nation-state with different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.299" end="00:51:05.400" style="s2">governance in place so when we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:07.880" style="s2">when I would run study abroad for many</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.400" end="00:51:12.299" style="s2">years and we ran our study abroad in</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.880" end="00:51:15.150" style="s2">2015-16 to Ecuador for 11 weeks I and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.299" end="00:51:17.010" style="s2">then we would always spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.150" end="00:51:18.869" style="s2">in advance talking with the students</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.010" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">about the nature of risk their</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.170" end="00:56:31.250" style="s2">yep all right there&#39;s a paper out</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.810" end="00:56:34.430" style="s2">suggesting that obesity is a significant</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.250" end="00:56:36.920" style="s2">risk factor in in bad outcomes in both</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:04.550" style="s2">the edges not going to go into into</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.500" end="00:57:06.320" style="s2">analysis like we did on the was this a</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.550" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">peer review paper or is this a preprint</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.320" end="00:57:12.110" style="s2">paper this is a preprint paper okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:14.270" style="s2">this is a preprint paper just out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.110" end="00:57:17.030" style="s2">was some journalistic reporting on it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.270" end="00:57:20.030" style="s2">including an article from Wired now</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.030" end="00:57:22.630" style="s2">wired as I understand it as I remember</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.030" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">it used to be a reasonable publication</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.630" end="00:57:26.570" style="s2">wasn&#39;t fully captured by the ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">people just yet but here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.570" end="00:57:33.080" style="s2">they have to say quote obesity appears</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:35.090" style="s2">to be one of the biggest risk factors</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.080" end="00:57:35.810" style="s2">related to kovat 19 hospitalizations and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.090" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">critical illness</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.810" end="00:57:39.980" style="s2">Newsweek claimed on Tuesday yet this</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:41.540" style="s2">rhetoric is based on flawed and limited</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.980" end="00:57:43.730" style="s2">evidence which only exacerbates the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.540" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">stigma that larger bodied people already</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.730" end="00:57:48.590" style="s2">face in society in our healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:51.080" style="s2">that stigma is what truly jeopardizes</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.590" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">their health not weight itself a fact</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.080" end="00:57:56.350" style="s2">that&#39;s only more important to consider</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:58.460" style="s2">in the midst of this pandemic wait what</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.350" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">you know really that just speaks for</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.460" end="00:58:04.070" style="s2">itself this I mean come on people</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:07.460" style="s2">yeah this is making Wired magazine a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.070" end="00:58:09.410" style="s2">risk factor yes reading what reading</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.460" end="00:58:11.450" style="s2">Wired magazine this you also heard this</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.410" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">here first reading Wired magazine turns</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.450" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">out to be correlated with being a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:18.650" style="s2">greater risk for coming down with over</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:21.920" style="s2">19 so can i wrap this back up into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.650" end="00:58:23.900" style="s2">the discussion lee yes of telomeres and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.920" end="00:58:28.070" style="s2">the magnetic force of the grave and all</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.900" end="00:58:30.800" style="s2">of that it is important that we now</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.070" end="00:58:32.840" style="s2">understand the way obesity is connected</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.800" end="00:58:35.990" style="s2">to many pathologies including maybe in</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.990" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">there&#39;s something obvious about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:45.560" style="s2">right to the extent that you are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:50.150" style="s2">machine that functions in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.560" end="00:58:52.580" style="s2">are subject to damage you are unlike</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.580" end="00:58:57.560" style="s2">because you can repair yourself you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:59:00.380" style="s2">you know your car can&#39;t replace a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.560" end="00:59:02.690" style="s2">ball-joint but you effectively can</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.380" end="00:59:05.960" style="s2">replace most of your tissues but the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.690" end="00:59:09.230" style="s2">rate of replacement is matched to your</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.960" end="00:59:10.940" style="s2">lifetime expectations of need and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.230" end="00:59:13.910" style="s2">can accelerate damage in any one of</p>

<p begin="00:59:13.910" end="00:59:17.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t anybody&#39;s fault right you&#39;re built</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.490" end="00:59:20.510" style="s2">for an environment where these resources</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.960" end="00:59:22.070" style="s2">are not highly available and many of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.510" end="00:59:26.270" style="s2">are built for seasonal environments</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.070" end="00:59:28.760" style="s2">where it makes sense to stock resources</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.760" end="00:59:37.110" style="s2">but the fact is every step that you make</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.870" end="00:59:39.270" style="s2">the world has a cost based on what</p>

<p begin="00:59:39.270" end="00:59:44.220" style="s2">your joints maybe this is less obvious</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.090" end="00:59:46.680" style="s2">but the wear and tear on your heart the</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.430" end="01:00:01.770" style="s2">should say fixed is probably just</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.710" end="01:00:03.960" style="s2">slightly too clean right it is it is set</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.770" end="01:00:05.820" style="s2">at birth for most tissues there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.960" end="01:00:07.500" style="s2">probably some flexibility but that</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.500" end="01:00:13.380" style="s2">mind a topic for another day so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.950" end="01:00:16.290" style="s2">yes obesity seems to be an important</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.380" end="01:00:18.090" style="s2">risk factor the good news is that is at</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.290" end="01:00:19.710" style="s2">least in principle something that might</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.090" end="01:00:21.870" style="s2">be under people&#39;s control although</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.710" end="01:00:24.030" style="s2">obviously not on this time scale right</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.870" end="01:00:26.030" style="s2">mom but this isn&#39;t the last time you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:00:26.030" end="01:00:35.070" style="s2">it&#39;s worth thinking about yeah good okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.060" end="01:00:37.730" style="s2">one more one more point and then we&#39;ll</p>
