<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">core principles we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">uh we discussed that we&#39;re going into an</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">and this is an idea that uh leo ferrara</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">and i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">myself from leo ferraro and uh the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">chapter we</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">published in um</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">a scientific study of personal wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">from contemplative traditions to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">neuroscientific investigation or</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">something like that i think it was 2013.</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">and we talked about a practice called</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">internalizing the sage</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">so we have this term right of a role</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">model and it comes up in things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">coaching</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">right what&#39;s a role model so i mean one</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">you learn as a parent is kids pay way</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">more attention to what you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">because they&#39;re imitating you than what</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">because they&#39;re not largely trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">store propositions from you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">into persons</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">role modeling is about the process of an</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">imitation</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">a mimetic activity so that we come to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">like the person</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">and this goes to uh internalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">sage</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">this notion of internalization comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">the developmental psychologist vygotsky</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">one of the greats</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">uh second only to piaget and vygotsky</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">talks about a process</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">so let&#39;s remember the the metaphor that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">we&#39;re using here</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">as the child is to the adult</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">the adult is to the sage</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">the text is we&#39;re trying to write</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">personify in a very powerful sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">trying to personify the text</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to personify and presence</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">the sage</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">so what vidatsky talks about is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">say here&#39;s a here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">my one of my sons when they&#39;re younger</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">here&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">and here&#39;s a problem that right now my</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">son can&#39;t solve that problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">he has a particular perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">and that perspective&#39;s not quite working</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">now what i have is i have a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">that encompasses both his perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">and my perspective and what he does</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">is he tries to imitate me because</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">he when he when he&#39;s within this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">perspective he can&#39;t see the biases of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">and he can&#39;t see goals and values that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">lie</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">outside the perspective i can see those</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">goals and values</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">and i can also see the biases within his</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">perspective and by</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">imitating me right by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">presence my perspective and envision it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">and invoke it he eventually gets this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">to take my perspective on his</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">and then he internalizes that ability it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">becomes an ability that he has for</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">he can step back and look at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:53.240" style="s2">perspective he can reflect upon it this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">is how we get what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.240" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">metacognition this is our our awareness</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">of our own</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">foot thinking and reasoning meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">above and beyond like metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">metacognition</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">but as the child is to the adult the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">adult is to the sage we want to presence</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:14.360" style="s2">the perspective of the sage so that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.360" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">self-transcend transform we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">self-transcend</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">by internalizing the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">sage</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">that will help us to see the biases of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">our everyday perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">and it will help us to envision and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">taste</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">values and goals that are not available</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">from within our perspective this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">primarily how we aspire</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">so what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re in we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:43.640" style="s2">trying to envision</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">the text we&#39;re trying to invoke for</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.640" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">internalization</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">the presence of this age so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.640" style="s2">role model</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">it to each role model that person that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.640" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">personification to each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">okay making sense of others</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">so we talked about creating a space</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">within ourselves a silent sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">space and we&#39;re letting what other</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">people say</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">reverberate in us very much like what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">do with lectio divina and the text</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">and we are also trying to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">the perspective of others</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">so the sage is an important voice</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">maybe right the central voice but all</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">the other voices are important too we</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">are forming a chorus of voices</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">and each person is like a mirror of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">the other voices we&#39;re internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">and trying to self-transform</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">in that fashion okay making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">sorry making sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">sorry i already did this making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">the text</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">making sense um of others making sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">with others so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">okay so what we&#39;re doing here um</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">sorry i think i did the wrong thing at</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">the beginning i i put up three things i</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">meant making sense of the text making</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">sense of others and making sense with</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">others i apologize for that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">i put making sense of self here uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s a mesh in all</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">of all three of these so please note</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">that that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">i apologize the triad should have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">making sense of text</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">right making sense of others</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">and then making sense with others i</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">apologize for that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">okay making because i was what was in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">mind was i wanted to convey</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">the the self transformation the self</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">so that was uppermost in my mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">why i made that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">okay making sense with others what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">trying to hear</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">do here is we&#39;re trying to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">so when we&#39;re speaking we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">resonate and when we&#39;re listening we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">trying to resonate with others</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to incorporate what</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">others say whenever we speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t speak as if we&#39;re a monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">isolated voice</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">i pick up on what other people have said</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">and what the text has said</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">and i incorporate it in like a jazz</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">musician</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">and i try to resonate with what other</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">are saying so what does that mean when</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">sense with others i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">engage in agreeing or disagreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">the text</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to evaluate the text i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">going to avoid speaking automatically</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">i&#39;m going to avoid speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">autobiography and i&#39;m going to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">authority i&#39;m trying to break monologue</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">so that i can make real dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">not pretended dialogue within the safe</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">security of my egocentric monologue</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">but general genuine i mean in general</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">genuine dialogue which is vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">open to other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m i&#39;m not trying to primarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">explain the text i am</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">trying to exemplify it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">that&#39;s how i&#39;m going to make sense with</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">others we&#39;re going to give</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">voice we&#39;re going to presence we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">going to resonate we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">so i talked about 3d</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.679" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">i want to get the depth of the text</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">i want to get the depth of the self</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">you can see that&#39;s where the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">came into my mind and i want to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">the depth of others</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">okay these are all co-emerging together</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">3d co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">when when we talk about getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">depth of the self</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">think of that aspirationally it means it</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">does mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">getting to that silent space and trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">to speak from the depths</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">but the depths are aspirational right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not a secret</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">secluded self the depths of yourself are</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">those parts</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">that are now coming into emergence</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">all right so we talked about the basic</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">setup</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">we talked about a four by four four</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">people that commit to four meetings</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">about an hour to an hour and a half long</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">at each meeting one of the four people</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">and then that&#39;s going to rotate with</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">every meeting</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">what the facilitator does is it organ</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">they organize the order</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">uh of the people there thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">doing it online which would probably be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">um a good uh idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">is alphabetical order and each person</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">memorizes who comes before them and who</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">comes after them take a few moments to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">the facilitator is also going to guide</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">people through the practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">right and the basic sequence is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">facilitator welcomes people</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">right then we set up the core four</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">everybody font does you write the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">finding their center finding the root</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">finding their flow finding their focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">right then we do the main exercise</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">which i call the ritual enactment</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">and then d we do take away</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">don&#39;t forget the takeaway the takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">is very important that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">pedagogical principle</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">what are the procedures we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:11.240" style="s2">the various procedures one is slow</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.240" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">some core uh interaction with the text</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">uh so you&#39;re re you&#39;re reciting the text</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">not just reading it</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like lectio recitation</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">you&#39;re reciting it the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">in lectio divina you&#39;re pausing so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">uh gather and internalize and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">also is right everybody is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">internalize the text that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">as it is being written they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">put into practice all those principles</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve been talking about we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">precious speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">so you&#39;re trying to hear you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">respond to the text there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">like i&#39;ll mention this later you have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">impression speaking your response you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">the 3d co-emergence so</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the one the main thing you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">there is a pause so people can gather</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">right the logos can take shape</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">uh within them and of course all the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">throughout</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">we are savoring we are savoring we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">savoring</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">all right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">what&#39;s the main exercise the ritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.840" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">enactment</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">we start with slow reading</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">then we move into rumutatio</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">then we do precious speaking</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">and the precious speaking is in response</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">a question which can be spoken by one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">the group or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">the facilitator what is the text</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">provoking</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">or invoking within you and between us</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">what is the text provoking or evoking</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">and the precious speaking is a response</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">to that question and you do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">for as many rounds as you wish to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">and then you move into intentional</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">conversing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">and then the fifth thing is the takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">the facilitator announces that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">intentional conversing is over</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.039" style="s2">everybody can step into a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">reflective explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.039" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">autobiographical mode here&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">go into explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">autobiographical reflective mode and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">what are you taking away from this</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">what are you taking away how how is this</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">touching you personally</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">how are you going to transfer this into</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">your life how are you going to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">into your everyday consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">cognition character and communitas</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">final thing where would this sit within</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">the overall ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to say because we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">working through the western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">what i would recommend perhaps right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">is that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">uh for example on the discord server you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">might want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">alternate uh between lectio divina</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">and uh philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">companionship because they really do</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">and this metaphor really sings now they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">really do speak to each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">in a powerful way but i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">mandate</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">i i don&#39;t have that authority or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">relevant expertise</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">i think but you know if you have people</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">doing lexio</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">in one and also pcc</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">separately that&#39;s fine but getting it it</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">optimal to my mind that if people were</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">practicing both</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">in some kind of tandem relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">because they they have they speak to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">each other they correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">and afford each other okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s everything again sorry for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">small glitch</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">um in the presentation i hope that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">and a helpful uh review</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">i&#39;m going to now move back uh to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">cushion so i can more properly see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">tv</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">and we&#39;ll address any questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">that might be coming up</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">great and uh grenin</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve just started interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">sang this week and i noticed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">contraction in my body as well as what i</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">would call selfing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">as i interact with the other egos can</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">you uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">recommend so i don&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">lesson it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">in fact i talked about it at various</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">places you might want to take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">michael washburn&#39;s book the ego on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">dynamic ground because he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">um a phenomena called body armor the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">in which and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">this is also coming out now in more</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">um certain patterns of how we frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">and identify things in situations in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">world and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">and assume identities in response all</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">that selfing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">a deeply embodied and often um armored</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.200" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">is to get very deeply into the core four</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">given what we&#39;re facing we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">need we&#39;re going to need collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">intelligence and more so than that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">going to need collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">um for what&#39;s coming and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">have been building here the next buddha</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">is the sangha</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">so encouraging and edifying each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">with these kinds of observations and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">are just as important as the asking of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">pedro acosta can you advise how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">meditate with eyes open</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t very much because i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">experience and therefore not much</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">relevant expertise i can pass on what</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">mostly second hand with a couple of uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">first time</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:54.800" style="s2">first person try first person</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">perspective tries actually trying it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.800" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">firsthand that&#39;s what i&#39;m clumsily</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">right um so the idea is to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">eyes open</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">and generally uh semi closed and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">looking down onto some place on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">earth that you pick as the spot</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">as your meditative focus you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">up and like this because that really uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">opens you up now</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">that that sort of stance is is uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">you know appropriate for some of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">moving contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">but if you&#39;re actually trying to engage</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">right you want the so uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">austin the guy who had zen of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">and other work he has research showing</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">that when you look</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">up like this it takes you into the third</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">person perspective processing areas of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">and when you look down like this it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">shifts you into the first person</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">processing areas of the brain so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">important but but</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">do that without tilting your head right</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">so you have to pick something sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it so you can see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">camera but that means i&#39;m tilting my</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">but you want to be i semi-closed looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">right onto a space on the ground that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t practice that way so i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">give you much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">uh i i understand some of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">why you would engage your way you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve only tried it once or twice</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a lot of confidence in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s especially important</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">to to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking out you&#39;re that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">excessively triggering mind wandering</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to do open eyes</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s due to my character and when i do</p>
