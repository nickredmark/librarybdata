<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">game B for the first time and although I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.179" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">still don&#39;t know if I&#39;m able to explain</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">in this video it has given me the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">language to talk about when I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:21.539" style="s2">doing for the last two years what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">global tech cooperative can give us</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.539" end="00:00:26.310" style="s2">which is creating game B from great game</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">a because anything that is game B has to</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.310" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">come out of game a and game a is our</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">current competitive game which is called</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">I call capitalism and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">talking about dismantling capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:43.190" style="s2">people get defensive this is better</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:46.590" style="s2">language creating game B out of game a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.190" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">creating the next thing and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.590" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">anything that is going to come out to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">more powerful to be game changing and B</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">have the competitive advantage nearly</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">right away is to include the masses not</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">demand the masses aren&#39;t included but</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">always have that invitation open to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">you want to be part of creating this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">having it be as transparent and open as</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">meaning it has to be intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">accessible and financially accessible it</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">can&#39;t be behind technological length a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">technical language that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">a degree to be able to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean people to have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">dumb down their language but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">be able to own as individuals I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">understand that I needed to explain to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">me because we&#39;re all gonna have areas we</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it in and we want</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.170" style="s2">people to come on board and say ok I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">see what has been done before I got here</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.170" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">so I can trust it and I can participate</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:40.790" style="s2">I can see I can get involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">niche that I want to be involved in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.790" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">allowing for that allowing that some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">people there might be a center group</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">that we all need to understand certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">speakers certain documentaries and but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">mainly it needs to be right no you study</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">what you&#39;re interested in how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">the common thread because the system is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">too complex we can&#39;t all know the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">things we&#39;re not all supposed to know</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">the same things we&#39;re supposed to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:15.430" style="s2">our individual complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:17.380" style="s2">individual uniqueness that adds up into</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.430" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">amazing complexity that that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.380" end="00:02:21.250" style="s2">bring to the table that is why it&#39;s omni</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:22.930" style="s2">wind because each of us is a unique</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.250" end="00:02:24.340" style="s2">individual when we bring ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.930" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">the table there&#39;s something there that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.340" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there before we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">copy us and be clones and have all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:33.220" style="s2">same intellect and the same abilities</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:35.980" style="s2">and the same challenges it&#39;s continually</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">owning what is challenging how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.980" end="00:02:40.510" style="s2">do we help people create an easier life</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:41.950" style="s2">how do we help people create a system</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.510" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">they want to participate in it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.950" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">fun and at the same time having the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:51.340" style="s2">group of actions that when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:54.490" style="s2">individually do what is simple and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.340" end="00:02:56.890" style="s2">enjoyable together is a mass powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.490" end="00:02:59.770" style="s2">powerful stuff gets done that does take</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.890" end="00:03:03.220" style="s2">over and so it does out-compete game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.770" end="00:03:04.840" style="s2">on its own turf so I&#39;m sitting with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.220" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">information I also had a three-hour</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.840" end="00:03:13.030" style="s2">conversation with my brother today but</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:14.410" style="s2">it was like labor and how we use a like</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.030" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">the thing we created was like well we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.410" end="00:03:17.830" style="s2">just solved the minute people don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:20.050" style="s2">to work for minimum wage anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.830" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">the only workers that are gonna be left</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.050" end="00:03:25.600" style="s2">outside of the system are basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:27.670" style="s2">basically the government workers and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:30.130" style="s2">ones that are paid really well and we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.670" end="00:03:31.660" style="s2">it like in all of it we solved it it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.130" end="00:03:33.610" style="s2">like this is weird now that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.660" end="00:03:37.030" style="s2">language that works for us to have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.610" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">conversation and I&#39;m loving this</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.030" end="00:03:40.930" style="s2">language and even though I struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.370" style="s2">new language there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.930" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">this because they talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.370" end="00:03:47.350" style="s2">biological terms and economic can and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:49.330" style="s2">that I was like most of what like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.350" end="00:03:50.770" style="s2">could even eukaryotic and prokaryotic it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.330" end="00:03:52.690" style="s2">was like yeah that was long before</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.770" end="00:03:54.730" style="s2">that&#39;s knowledge it&#39;s in my head I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.690" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">that I don&#39;t need to learn that I could</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">learn the little pieces of language to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">be able to communicate in this language</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.500" end="00:04:04.120" style="s2">with people who are already passionate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:05.590" style="s2">about this because game B is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.120" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">language that comes like thank you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.590" end="00:04:09.340" style="s2">someone gave it language because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:11.709" style="s2">was the thing I was missing I am not</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.340" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">strong on language and but I&#39;m strong on</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.709" end="00:04:15.910" style="s2">the underlying concepts of like how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">actually create this and have struggled</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.910" end="00:04:20.859" style="s2">with it it&#39;s a little antithesis an</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">aesthetical a little antithetical to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.859" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">actual the game be a concept though to</p>
