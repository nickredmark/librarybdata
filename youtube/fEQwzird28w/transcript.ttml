<p begin="00:00:02.730" end="00:00:08.189" style="s2">episode it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">done a face to camera introduction and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.189" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">it&#39;s still the truth I was always</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:14.580" style="s2">shitted them always fucking hated them</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:16.650" style="s2">and so actually this time I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.580" end="00:00:18.180" style="s2">read something out from what I already</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.650" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">have now I&#39;m doing the intro to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.180" end="00:00:23.539" style="s2">intro and well please bear with me and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.199" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">there were some things I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.539" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">for grounding this conversation that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:31.520" style="s2">would just take too long to say if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:33.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t write them down first</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.520" end="00:00:36.020" style="s2">joining me for this dialogue is Greg and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.620" end="00:00:38.210" style="s2">Rica&#39;s an award-winning professor of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.020" end="00:00:41.180" style="s2">graduate psychology at James Madison</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.210" end="00:00:43.580" style="s2">University a man with a rare combination</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.180" end="00:00:46.430" style="s2">of deep expertise and a breadth of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.580" end="00:00:48.800" style="s2">integrative perspective to match this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.430" end="00:00:50.450" style="s2">an exciting conversation I think and my</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.800" end="00:00:52.400" style="s2">sense after only coming to knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.450" end="00:00:54.260" style="s2">Greg&#39;s work a matter of weeks ago is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.400" end="00:00:56.390" style="s2">that this is someone who will have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:00:59.420" style="s2">deep impact on the future of the science</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.390" end="00:01:00.980" style="s2">of psychology or die trying&#39; there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.420" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">energy and insight here that will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.980" end="00:01:05.540" style="s2">very worthwhile for some of you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:06.950" style="s2">investigate and track further but before</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.540" end="00:01:08.570" style="s2">we get to our conversation I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.950" end="00:01:11.420" style="s2">say a few things that feed into each</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.570" end="00:01:13.580" style="s2">other as I reflect on the library of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.420" end="00:01:15.710" style="s2">content this podcast features now hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.580" end="00:01:17.750" style="s2">at all been about providing a 101</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.710" end="00:01:20.270" style="s2">overview or introduction to someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.750" end="00:01:23.390" style="s2">thinking and this has created dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.270" end="00:01:25.009" style="s2">at times when I speak to someone I seek</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.390" end="00:01:26.840" style="s2">to arrive as quickly and as</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.009" end="00:01:30.619" style="s2">appropriately as possible to a shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.840" end="00:01:32.149" style="s2">relationship with possibility okay well</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.619" end="00:01:35.270" style="s2">perhaps we can think about it better</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.149" end="00:01:37.340" style="s2">like this the movements of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.270" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">or the practice of biological</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.340" end="00:01:41.750" style="s2">transformation and the core of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">project if it flows and if it is most</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.750" end="00:01:46.220" style="s2">effective arrives at the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:49.179" style="s2">significant adjacent possible available</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.220" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">to mutual understanding co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.179" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">creating together in relationship this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:57.950" style="s2">is not so easy there are many obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:02:01.009" style="s2">social cognitive normative logistical</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.950" end="00:02:03.679" style="s2">game theoretic trust and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.009" end="00:02:07.490" style="s2">and time and credibility thing you name</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.679" end="00:02:09.259" style="s2">it now this is also a podcast so when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.490" end="00:02:11.990" style="s2">sit down to record with someone that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.259" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">in mind and I do care about creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.990" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">things that are deeply helpful and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">take responsibility for my part in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:20.360" style="s2">content Commons and so I do aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">create an art form that serves both the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.360" end="00:02:24.740" style="s2">ends of generativity and the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">sense of engagement and context that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.740" end="00:02:29.780" style="s2">properly serves you the listener</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">especially as this project continues to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.780" end="00:02:34.069" style="s2">and will expand its invitations to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:36.050" style="s2">participate in the emergent conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.069" end="00:02:39.590" style="s2">you can follow the links to check that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.050" end="00:02:41.990" style="s2">out to put it a slightly different way</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.590" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">and to foreground the theory and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.990" end="00:02:46.610" style="s2">I believe will become more clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:48.980" style="s2">over the coming years and decades this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.610" end="00:02:51.080" style="s2">art form here aspired to will come to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:53.090" style="s2">seen as a practice somewhat akin to an</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.080" end="00:02:57.290" style="s2">emergent archetype of collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.090" end="00:02:58.730" style="s2">realization so now back to Greg I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.290" end="00:03:00.440" style="s2">going to give a short introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.730" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">Greg&#39;s thinking not to articulate his</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.440" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">theory and not to speak for him but to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:06.350" style="s2">set the scene for some background</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:09.230" style="s2">context to help you make sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.350" end="00:03:11.540" style="s2">conversation that follows as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.230" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">can tell Greg Enrique seems to be here</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.540" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">to wake the world of psychology up again</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">to the importance of the very what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">the science of psychology seeks to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">understand a man it&#39;s funny how the what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:26.930" style="s2">in things gets lost the what to care</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:28.760" style="s2">about hey as I think about it it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.930" end="00:03:30.800" style="s2">machine like this way we confuse</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.760" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">ourselves a machine consists of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.800" end="00:03:34.970" style="s2">scripted processes it runs its method</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:37.010" style="s2">without understanding of a more</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.970" end="00:03:40.310" style="s2">essential nature of reality within which</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.010" end="00:03:41.750" style="s2">or upon which it&#39;s processes operate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.310" end="00:03:43.520" style="s2">machine might have functions or</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.750" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">imperatives whether it&#39;s a carry out</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.520" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">intended tasks with precision or</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">effectively generate paperclips but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:53.540" style="s2">missing something vital someone might</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:56.300" style="s2">make the same case for human beings of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.540" end="00:03:59.750" style="s2">course doomed to ultimate ignorant as to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.300" end="00:04:01.459" style="s2">what we participate in I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.750" end="00:04:03.500" style="s2">all conceive our limitations in just</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.459" end="00:04:06.050" style="s2">that way it&#39;s rather that we&#39;ve placed</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.500" end="00:04:08.570" style="s2">dead limitations on what the what could</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.050" end="00:04:10.550" style="s2">be and more importantly stifled our</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.570" end="00:04:14.030" style="s2">capacity to be in relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.550" end="00:04:15.890" style="s2">ongoing realization of that what I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.030" end="00:04:18.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve rather forgotten what maybe was</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.890" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">once known like the wisp of a dream the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.440" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">deep quest of knowing ourselves each</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:22.520" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.680" style="s2">and the world in favor of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.520" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">about how to optimize for games we play</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.680" end="00:04:30.350" style="s2">within it this bloody issue of survival</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">and fear and attachment we can weep for</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.350" end="00:04:34.550" style="s2">that but not all the time it&#39;s a thesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:36.530" style="s2">of this project that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.550" end="00:04:39.710" style="s2">reimagine the games themselves the maps</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.530" end="00:04:41.270" style="s2">themselves not for the maps or the games</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.710" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:45.949" style="s2">but for the vitality and wonder to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:49.449" style="s2">realized in the process of the game</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.949" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">making the map making the lovemaking but</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.449" end="00:04:55.910" style="s2">we&#39;ll leave this as gesture now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">problem of psychology that Greg takes</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.910" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">his work to attempt to resolve is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:02.210" style="s2">if you take a 101 site course you will</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">likely learn that psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.210" end="00:05:07.819" style="s2">science of behavior and mental processes</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:09.590" style="s2">but the problem is that psychology has</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.819" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">sought to adhere to the methods of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.590" end="00:05:15.319" style="s2">science without an adequate unified</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:17.810" style="s2">sense of what the reference behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.319" end="00:05:20.930" style="s2">mental processes really mean and really</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.810" end="00:05:22.729" style="s2">are there are many approaches within</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.930" end="00:05:24.979" style="s2">psychology not defined the terms in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.729" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">different ways but they are often in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.979" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">conflict so it goes which amounts to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">increasing fragmentation theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:35.060" style="s2">and clinically so Greg&#39;s work is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:37.400" style="s2">response to this problem by way of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.060" end="00:05:39.139" style="s2">he terms the unified theory part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.400" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">which is the tree of knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.139" end="00:05:44.120" style="s2">which offers a map of cosmic evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">as an unfolding wave of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.120" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:49.789" style="s2">he wants to coherently define behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">and mental processes in a system of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.789" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">descriptive metaphysics a map that not</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:57.409" style="s2">only makes sense of the history of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2">reality but one that also nods to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.409" end="00:06:01.610" style="s2">conditions and dynamics which may</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:04.099" style="s2">precede a radical phase transition or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.610" end="00:06:06.289" style="s2">emergence of a novel dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.099" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">complexity that may be just around the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.289" end="00:06:10.969" style="s2">corner I really enjoyed this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">thank you for being here</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:27.710" style="s2">put out conversations these days without</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:30.919" style="s2">offering those invitations I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.710" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">an error and not what it could be and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.919" end="00:06:34.969" style="s2">not part all timidly of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.139" end="00:06:52.520" style="s2">so Greg I have just encountered your</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">work and I am aware it&#39;s very broad in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.520" end="00:06:58.520" style="s2">scope and that makes framing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:00.289" style="s2">conversation that might introduce some</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:01.099" style="s2">of your work and some of your ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.289" end="00:07:04.699" style="s2">who you are</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.099" end="00:07:08.750" style="s2">a bit challenging and it gives me an</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.699" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">opportunity to open things in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.750" end="00:07:17.930" style="s2">I personally am most interested to open</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.750" end="00:07:21.050" style="s2">and and perhaps that is with the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.930" end="00:07:24.199" style="s2">abroad of questions so when you close</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.050" end="00:07:26.060" style="s2">your eyes and perhaps not not you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.199" end="00:07:27.710" style="s2">now we&#39;re in the last few seconds but</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.060" end="00:07:33.320" style="s2">when you find yourself closing your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.710" end="00:07:36.289" style="s2">and you are attending to just what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:39.110" style="s2">hell is going on and perhaps not in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.289" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">way that&#39;s too confrontational like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.110" end="00:07:44.389" style="s2">the hell is going on here you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:47.030" style="s2">necessarily chaotic but just you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.389" end="00:07:51.229" style="s2">encounter ring that presence like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.030" end="00:07:55.610" style="s2">familiarity and you exist and we exist</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.229" end="00:07:59.469" style="s2">and here we are yes how have you begun</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.610" end="00:08:05.469" style="s2">to make sense of the phenomenon of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.469" end="00:08:08.270" style="s2">great that&#39;s a wonderful entry question</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.469" end="00:08:13.219" style="s2">because what the hell is going on is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.270" end="00:08:19.009" style="s2">great way of describing my logos in to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.219" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">phenomenology as you well you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.009" end="00:08:23.870" style="s2">what the hell is going on right now is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:27.969" style="s2">particularly poignant of course with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.870" end="00:08:33.289" style="s2">context of the virus and the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.969" end="00:08:39.589" style="s2">experience of change and despair and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.289" end="00:08:44.290" style="s2">hope so I&#39;ve been ever since you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.589" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">the shutdown and through March I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.290" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">experiencing a lot of what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:51.520" style="s2">going on in terms of the global Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.520" style="s2">of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">and that speaks to me in the deep ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.060" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">of both crisis and opportunity as in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:07.700" style="s2">terms of I see what is going on as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">crisis of our modern global experience I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.700" end="00:09:15.620" style="s2">also see in us at opportunity and I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:19.779" style="s2">feel very much woven into the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.620" end="00:09:22.820" style="s2">it quite frankly I feel very connected</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.779" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">to it and simultaneously hopeful and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.820" end="00:09:32.589" style="s2">despairing in relation it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.589" style="s2">interesting tension to Zakarian</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.750" end="00:09:37.589" style="s2">yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.499" end="00:09:39.059" style="s2">relationship between hope and despair so</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.589" end="00:09:45.239" style="s2">perhaps you find yourself at least in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.059" end="00:09:47.669" style="s2">part sort of in within this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.239" end="00:09:50.369" style="s2">perhaps because of your work and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.669" end="00:09:53.069" style="s2">practice as a psychologist and clinical</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.369" end="00:09:57.059" style="s2">psychologist but I also know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.069" end="00:10:01.229" style="s2">deep interest in metaphysics and so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.059" end="00:10:04.619" style="s2">what ways do those features of how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.229" end="00:10:06.809" style="s2">show up in the world sort of help</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.619" end="00:10:11.249" style="s2">articulate for our listeners how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.809" end="00:10:16.409" style="s2">framed yourself now sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.249" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">so one is if I just put it in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.409" end="00:10:23.219" style="s2">direct terms from for me one is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:27.719" style="s2">relational phenomenological world as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.219" end="00:10:33.319" style="s2">clinician I sort of have an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.719" end="00:10:35.609" style="s2">and have cultivated the an empathetic</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.369" end="00:10:50.189" style="s2">experiencing this globally then you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.359" end="00:10:53.099" style="s2">in terms of the amount of suffering that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.189" end="00:10:55.199" style="s2">the wave of the medical crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.099" end="00:10:56.970" style="s2">followed by the economic crisis followed</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.950" style="s2">the central point and I think that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.450" end="00:19:38.020" style="s2">interested in getting your response to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.840" end="00:19:42.100" style="s2">way of speaking about the dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.020" end="00:19:44.590" style="s2">process that I seem to resonate with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.100" end="00:19:46.600" style="s2">lot at the moment is how I at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.590" end="00:19:50.730" style="s2">introduce some conversations I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.600" end="00:19:55.180" style="s2">relate to them myself and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.730" end="00:19:56.680" style="s2">certain kind of dialogical conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.180" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">which enables a movement of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.680" end="00:20:07.510" style="s2">understanding I&#39;d be interested in well</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:10.830" style="s2">so a movement there is some kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.510" end="00:20:15.660" style="s2">just briefly a nod to the process yule</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.830" end="00:20:19.210" style="s2">nature of our interdependence and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.660" end="00:20:21.730" style="s2">seeming cycles of different states of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.210" end="00:20:25.750" style="s2">awareness different kinds of knowing but</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.730" end="00:20:29.500" style="s2">also almost in almost in variability of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.750" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">our forgetting there&#39;s somewhat of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.500" end="00:20:33.930" style="s2">open question there as to what may be</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:38.100" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.930" end="00:20:40.680" style="s2">at the very edges of awareness in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.100" end="00:20:43.050" style="s2">of the continuity that&#39;s enabled I do</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.680" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">think there&#39;s something to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.050" end="00:20:57.210" style="s2">striving for a continuity of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">that that that&#39;s important but we seem</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.210" end="00:21:02.820" style="s2">to forget a and perhaps the forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:04.350" style="s2">is is necessary for the remembering and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.820" end="00:21:08.220" style="s2">then there&#39;s this question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.350" end="00:21:11.930" style="s2">understanding which itself from some</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:14.340" style="s2">angles seems to shift but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.930" end="00:21:17.390" style="s2">we can participate in it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.340" end="00:21:21.030" style="s2">nevertheless with each other we can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.390" end="00:21:23.730" style="s2">grounded in something valuable even as</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.030" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">that ground itself might move from</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.730" end="00:21:28.980" style="s2">certain perspectives so I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">interested in just your take on how a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.980" end="00:21:34.260" style="s2">movement of understanding what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">triggers in your in your in your mind in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.260" end="00:21:45.030" style="s2">your body brilliant yeah and so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:49.950" style="s2">of things captured there that I can riff</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.030" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">off for a bit so one of the things the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.950" end="00:21:56.490" style="s2">continuity of experience and also the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">fading of experience captured me as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.490" end="00:21:59.910" style="s2">ride the wave of our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:02.040" style="s2">experience and then file away or</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.910" end="00:22:06.030" style="s2">episodic memories but lose so much of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.040" end="00:22:07.920" style="s2">right in relation and what is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.030" end="00:22:10.110" style="s2">continuity and when do we feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.920" end="00:22:12.290" style="s2">continuity is coalescing and building</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.110" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">and accumulative sense of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.290" end="00:22:18.060" style="s2">and what I&#39;m captured by there is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.750" end="00:22:19.650" style="s2">idea that we&#39;re sort of on this when</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.060" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to understand to use the</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:26.940" style="s2">the edge of the unknown we we explore</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.560" end="00:22:34.710" style="s2">want to find the edge of that and we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">looking to see what&#39;s relevant in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.710" end="00:22:41.790" style="s2">new at the same time we&#39;re dancing and</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.470" end="00:23:36.929" style="s2">but man I kind of resonate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.380" end="00:23:38.550" style="s2">experience that so so a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.929" end="00:23:40.770" style="s2">come up for me when we start to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.550" end="00:23:45.450" style="s2">about understanding and knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.770" end="00:23:47.670" style="s2">continuity and and I am seeking</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.450" end="00:23:50.179" style="s2">understanding in many ways I&#39;ll often</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.670" end="00:23:53.720" style="s2">say that wisdom and understanding or two</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.179" end="00:23:58.530" style="s2">unbelievably foundational words for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.720" end="00:24:00.630" style="s2">so it is the fundamental that more than</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.530" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s the fundamental experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.630" end="00:24:04.650" style="s2">of understanding which is broader its</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">knowings more propositional</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.650" end="00:24:13.880" style="s2">understanding or participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:18.420" style="s2">perspective all and grounded in body</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.880" end="00:24:21.929" style="s2">yeah particularly important when we come</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.420" end="00:24:25.050" style="s2">into touch with other people who well</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.929" end="00:24:28.170" style="s2">might recoil from our touch necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.050" end="00:24:29.820" style="s2">physically but let&#39;s say whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.170" end="00:24:33.960" style="s2">energetically or proposition me</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.820" end="00:24:38.280" style="s2">psychologically it does seem to be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.960" end="00:24:42.059" style="s2">case that the continued fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.280" end="00:24:44.190" style="s2">society is a possible future at least in</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.340" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">then into some degree you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.760" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate to fractionate if if</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">there&#39;s something dead about the there</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.760" end="00:25:04.740" style="s2">the large you know collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.920" end="00:25:07.420" style="s2">active block but navigating difference</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.080" end="00:25:18.790" style="s2">at least some kind of reciprocity um</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.710" end="00:25:20.440" style="s2">that is a level more reciprocal than</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.790" end="00:25:24.870" style="s2">than violence you know what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:29.050" style="s2">to say absolutely what do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.870" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">what do we have to be aware of what can</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.050" end="00:25:36.700" style="s2">we be aware of to help enter into these</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:38.440" style="s2">movements then how do we invite I like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.700" end="00:25:40.060" style="s2">to think how do we invite this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.440" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">something I&#39;m so interested in how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.060" end="00:25:48.820" style="s2">invite participation in movements of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:50.530" style="s2">understanding right yeah and your</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:53.530" style="s2">reflection on that&#39;s really key because</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.530" end="00:25:56.580" style="s2">the framing of that to invite people in</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.530" end="00:26:00.970" style="s2">is absolutely central if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.580" end="00:26:02.740" style="s2">sort of the preordained frame upon which</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:08.980" style="s2">unfortunately many of our pre existing</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.540" end="00:26:11.590" style="s2">institutional frames are essentially</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.850" end="00:26:47.140" style="s2">other side and then you have to decide</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.990" end="00:26:49.030" style="s2">whether to defend yourself okay and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.140" end="00:26:53.100" style="s2">position is not about understanding but</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.999" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">frequently it is that you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.950" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">mm-hmm so what does that mean it means</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.590" end="00:27:41.940" style="s2">we need to create a metacognitive space</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:44.610" style="s2">of awareness of the rules of this</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.999" end="00:27:56.789" style="s2">to use starters frame of reference it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.690" end="00:28:00.450" style="s2">like okay I&#39;m gonna commit to certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.789" end="00:28:04.289" style="s2">higher values and I&#39;m gonna commit to</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.309" end="00:28:14.489" style="s2">necessarily need to use those terms you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.869" end="00:28:16.739" style="s2">can just say hey I want to try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.489" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">understand you I want to understand what</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.489" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can understand each</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.659" end="00:28:27.570" style="s2">other if we have problems let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:29.399" style="s2">we can find solutions and I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.570" end="00:28:33.239" style="s2">to use violence or hostility or</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.399" end="00:28:36.659" style="s2">character degradation in that process no</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.659" end="00:28:41.249" style="s2">saying well always agree or won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.460" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">disagree sharply but it&#39;s to say that</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.879" end="00:29:01.529" style="s2">at least offer a guardrail free yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.480" end="00:29:08.730" style="s2">this this um the question of framing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.529" end="00:29:10.769" style="s2">frame that is the thing to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.730" end="00:29:13.139" style="s2">space in when we invite it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.139" end="00:29:18.090" style="s2">of it&#39;s what&#39;s brought along through the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.179" end="00:29:24.659" style="s2">invitation this is this really gets to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.090" end="00:29:26.020" style="s2">the core of a deep area of interest for</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.659" end="00:29:29.770" style="s2">me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.020" end="00:29:31.270" style="s2">I think maybe I thought maybe I think it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.770" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">is on on the frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.270" end="00:29:37.710" style="s2">how to make generative steps forward in</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:40.450" style="s2">this space because when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.710" end="00:29:43.150" style="s2">frame making and inviting people into</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.450" end="00:29:45.250" style="s2">frames we we have to have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.150" end="00:29:47.470" style="s2">amount of self knowledge of just what</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.250" end="00:29:49.090" style="s2">what actual frames we are bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.470" end="00:29:52.360" style="s2">bear and we know of course we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.090" end="00:29:53.950" style="s2">complex organisms and there&#39;s part of me</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.360" end="00:29:55.480" style="s2">that have to frame that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.950" end="00:29:57.490" style="s2">speak to each other for a couple hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.480" end="00:29:59.110" style="s2">here there&#39;s it&#39;s part of me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.490" end="00:30:01.150" style="s2">gonna be hungry in four hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.110" end="00:30:02.440" style="s2">certainly in 10 hours if we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.150" end="00:30:13.960" style="s2">talking by then I&#39;d be like great mate</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.440" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">this is not what I sow and of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.960" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">it&#39;s and of course it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.730" end="00:30:24.130" style="s2">threatening than all of that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.580" end="00:30:27.430" style="s2">have this machinery in us we have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.130" end="00:30:30.100" style="s2">capacity in us to be very moved by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.430" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">frames of others and of course the lens</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.100" end="00:30:35.500" style="s2">of ideology the lens of various ways of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:37.480" style="s2">making sense are inform our</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:43.300" style="s2">understanding of ourselves and the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.480" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">and so when we talk about rules we might</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.300" end="00:30:50.500" style="s2">talk about the kind of education that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">might be required in the ecology to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.500" end="00:30:53.920" style="s2">people gain some sort of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:56.710" style="s2">of these rules and then I think well</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.920" end="00:30:59.050" style="s2">before that before that how can I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.710" end="00:31:02.140" style="s2">something I am interested in is how do I</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.050" end="00:31:04.990" style="s2">and to communicate this to others how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.140" end="00:31:08.560" style="s2">hold oneself how to come into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.990" end="00:31:11.860" style="s2">awareness of oneself and be in relation</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.560" end="00:31:15.160" style="s2">to something greater than oneself a kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.860" end="00:31:18.250" style="s2">of an ongoing process of frame making</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.160" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">that holds the dignity of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.250" end="00:31:24.520" style="s2">in in critical esteem that they that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:27.100" style="s2">they are part of that process that there</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.520" end="00:31:28.930" style="s2">is no frame for me if in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.100" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">the invitation is not at least in</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.930" end="00:31:34.300" style="s2">principle extended to all now that is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.590" end="00:31:36.040" style="s2">crazy thing to say and I don&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.300" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">say it flippantly because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.040" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">much it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:43.630" style="s2">I think that well actually because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:45.130" style="s2">felt like there&#39;s a lot of residents</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.630" end="00:31:47.650" style="s2">with us I actually speak that language</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.130" end="00:31:49.800" style="s2">quite deeply so I was just nodding along</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.650" end="00:31:52.750" style="s2">with everything you were saying mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.800" end="00:31:59.590" style="s2">so so to crystallize a question then</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.750" end="00:32:01.450" style="s2">might be something like how how do we so</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.590" end="00:32:03.670" style="s2">I almost don&#39;t want to even frame it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.450" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">very act of doing this is is something</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.670" end="00:32:08.200" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m wary of part of me was</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:10.120" style="s2">driven to to ask how can we come to an</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.200" end="00:32:12.430" style="s2">understanding within or the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.120" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">psychic technologies that might lend us</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.430" end="00:32:16.030" style="s2">an understanding afford us the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:17.920" style="s2">transformation of our own understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.030" end="00:32:21.130" style="s2">of ourselves such that we can extend</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.920" end="00:32:25.980" style="s2">invitations in more integrity but by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.130" end="00:32:29.500" style="s2">same token there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.980" end="00:32:32.020" style="s2">realizing that frame in dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.500" end="00:32:33.790" style="s2">relationship with others that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.020" end="00:32:35.230" style="s2">kin kick in very quickly because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.790" end="00:32:36.850" style="s2">not me just going off and being isolated</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.230" end="00:32:38.290" style="s2">right and a whole bunch of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.850" end="00:32:44.020" style="s2">coming out and saying here play my game</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.290" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">it&#39;s so how do we so so well-kept yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.020" end="00:32:48.790" style="s2">so anyway this is definitely a lot this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:51.220" style="s2">is front and center to some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.790" end="00:32:54.550" style="s2">that I&#39;m working on and I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.220" end="00:32:57.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve been working on it also and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.550" end="00:32:59.920" style="s2">know so here here&#39;s here&#39;s what I offer</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.250" end="00:33:02.410" style="s2">and then and I offer it in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.920" end="00:33:05.170" style="s2">what I call integrative plurals okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.410" end="00:33:08.800" style="s2">integrated means that we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.170" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">find a way to share a frame or else you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.800" end="00:33:13.210" style="s2">know then we won&#39;t exchange so at some</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:14.650" style="s2">level we have some notion that we will</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.210" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">come together and have some reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.650" end="00:33:19.720" style="s2">or else we wouldn&#39;t be connected at some</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:23.050" style="s2">level and at the same time your frame</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.720" end="00:33:27.400" style="s2">and perspective and experience is going</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.050" end="00:33:28.750" style="s2">to create a variation on your experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.400" end="00:33:30.580" style="s2">and position that&#39;s different than mine</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:32.740" style="s2">so there&#39;s going to be plurality in</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.580" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">relation in plurality of preference and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.740" end="00:33:38.440" style="s2">emphasis and in value hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:40.390" style="s2">things along those lines okay so so an</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.440" end="00:33:44.800" style="s2">integrative pluralism is a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.390" end="00:33:48.040" style="s2">between pulling together and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.800" end="00:33:51.370" style="s2">for differentiation so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.040" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">basic principle it&#39;s actually by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.370" end="00:33:55.960" style="s2">I would consume</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:57.700" style="s2">a meta modern principle in many ways in</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.960" end="00:33:59.410" style="s2">the sense that sort of modernism it at</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.700" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">least said it&#39;s sort of a narrow version</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.410" end="00:34:04.030" style="s2">of modernism and it&#39;s rationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.920" style="s2">conception of one truth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.030" end="00:34:09.820" style="s2">post-modernism with its fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.920" end="00:34:12.040" style="s2">pluralism an identity of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.820" end="00:34:14.919" style="s2">value would be an integrated plural so</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.040" end="00:34:17.050" style="s2">that sort of offers a synthesis between</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.919" end="00:34:19.210" style="s2">the modern thesis and the postmodern in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.050" end="00:34:22.030" style="s2">businesses so there&#39;s a there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.210" end="00:34:24.190" style="s2">a cultural sensibility that connect</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.030" end="00:34:25.629" style="s2">there but really it&#39;s like hey I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.190" end="00:34:27.070" style="s2">version you have a vision I bet they</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.629" end="00:34:27.460" style="s2">overlap so but I also bet they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.070" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.460" end="00:34:32.530" style="s2">and let&#39;s preciate that so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:36.070" style="s2">first thing when I&#39;m offering my vision</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.530" end="00:34:38.110" style="s2">I offer the following I say that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.070" end="00:34:41.050" style="s2">know in terms of the I have some meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.110" end="00:34:43.720" style="s2">cultural values that I commit you okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.050" end="00:34:47.889" style="s2">and by medical sure I mean they sixth</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.720" end="00:34:50.169" style="s2">end beyond my nationality and they sixth</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.889" end="00:34:53.020" style="s2">end beyond my sense of a westerner or</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.169" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re basically positioned me</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.020" end="00:34:58.930" style="s2">as a human in the cosmos and say all</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">right this is Easter and those big three</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.930" end="00:35:05.740" style="s2">values are dignity</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.290" end="00:35:08.530" style="s2">well-being and integrity okay so those</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.740" end="00:35:10.810" style="s2">are my big three values and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.530" end="00:35:13.840" style="s2">represent dignity the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.810" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">fundamental human dignity is the grounds</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.840" end="00:35:18.330" style="s2">the National Decker if you know United</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:20.710" style="s2">Nations Declaration of Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.330" end="00:35:22.570" style="s2">I&#39;d also mean it more in an incremental</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.710" end="00:35:25.000" style="s2">way that we can have more or less</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.570" end="00:35:27.220" style="s2">dignity respect for ourselves or others</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.000" end="00:35:29.950" style="s2">and you know what we do because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.220" end="00:35:31.690" style="s2">fundamental dignity well-being is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.950" end="00:35:33.970" style="s2">mission of the organization but</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.690" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">basically I spend a lot of time defining</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.970" end="00:35:37.320" style="s2">what that is technically but you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:40.590" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially health and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.320" end="00:35:43.090" style="s2">bio psychosocial health and happiness oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.590" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">and we want to cultivate that as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.090" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">to suffering colloquially defined and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:53.140" style="s2">integrity really refers to truth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:55.000" style="s2">honesty to being truth and honest so so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.140" end="00:35:57.430" style="s2">really respect health and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.000" end="00:35:59.560" style="s2">truth and honesty those are those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.430" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">the meta cultural values that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.560" end="00:36:04.060" style="s2">play by and I invite that then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:06.250" style="s2">you know and if you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.060" end="00:36:10.030" style="s2">I hope folks will play that if folks</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.250" end="00:36:11.500" style="s2">don&#39;t want to play that it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.030" end="00:36:15.820" style="s2">now hard to play you know I was like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.500" end="00:36:18.120" style="s2">yeah you don&#39;t you know do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.820" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">defend myself physically I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.120" end="00:36:26.230" style="s2">okay tend to be pretty broad most people</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:28.120" style="s2">find those to be yeah no I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.230" end="00:36:30.910" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absolutely beautiful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.120" end="00:36:33.490" style="s2">I resonate so strongly I mean in in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.910" end="00:36:37.240" style="s2">way it&#39;s kind of like we could we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.490" end="00:36:40.270" style="s2">frame as a dignity as in there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.240" end="00:36:43.240" style="s2">multiple players well-being that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.270" end="00:36:46.420" style="s2">directionality and integrity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.240" end="00:36:48.490" style="s2">conduct to how we play the game so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.420" end="00:36:50.170" style="s2">even and of course there&#39;s much more to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.490" end="00:36:52.660" style="s2">be said qualitatively for these notions</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.170" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">but just structurally we&#39;ve got here</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.660" end="00:36:58.450" style="s2">what isn&#39;t it necessary to actually play</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">I love the way you&#39;re riffing off those</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.450" end="00:37:01.480" style="s2">things that&#39;s why actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.640" style="s2">exactly the design of those things is</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.480" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">that people as an integrated pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.640" end="00:37:08.260" style="s2">kind of you you take those each of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.970" style="s2">poles and you suck up and you move them</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.260" end="00:37:14.470" style="s2">around and you can then project onto</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.970" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">them wide a different so for example you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.470" end="00:37:18.610" style="s2">can go good true beautiful so beauty</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.690" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">connects to dignity and the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.610" end="00:37:24.580" style="s2">value well-being to goodness and true to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:27.130" style="s2">integrity that&#39;s just one example okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.580" end="00:37:29.350" style="s2">you hit on the other was a great example</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.130" end="00:37:31.300" style="s2">which I hadn&#39;t heard before but I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.350" end="00:37:33.790" style="s2">seen lots of people pick up these big</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.300" end="00:37:37.210" style="s2">three and then juxtapose them in very</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.790" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">creative ways that resonate with me but</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.210" end="00:37:41.110" style="s2">novelty so that&#39;s one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:44.950" style="s2">like them is that they do that you did</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.110" end="00:37:46.360" style="s2">it wonderful I was in the next and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.950" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">shows this sort of intuitively that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.360" end="00:37:50.890" style="s2">like yeah okay actually if we have this</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:53.410" style="s2">this is a it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.890" end="00:37:57.300" style="s2">rule-based framing but it&#39;s a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.410" end="00:38:01.560" style="s2">principled process meta value frame yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.300" end="00:38:04.990" style="s2">so maybe here is a good opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.560" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">to talk about what are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.990" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">practices or because it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:11.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve just taken a little bit of it of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:14.050" style="s2">an intellectual approach just for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.980" end="00:38:17.590" style="s2">moment in terms of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.050" end="00:38:19.930" style="s2">importance of these we say we say is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.590" end="00:38:22.900" style="s2">Metsu virtues what did what what is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.930" end="00:38:25.750" style="s2">Oh meta values but yeah buddies meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.900" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">cultural values yes the sort of long</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.750" end="00:38:35.430" style="s2">name for him yeah so yeah interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:40.210" style="s2">wonder so we say meta cultural values</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.430" end="00:38:41.860" style="s2">how did those values show up you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.210" end="00:38:44.080" style="s2">could probably say some things about</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.860" end="00:38:47.980" style="s2">this but I&#39;m interested in how how do</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.080" end="00:38:51.010" style="s2">those values show up in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.980" end="00:38:53.080" style="s2">can I relate to myself in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.010" end="00:38:55.720" style="s2">as helpful as I can relate</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.080" end="00:39:00.610" style="s2">so from this meta cultural level using</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.720" end="00:39:02.680" style="s2">these three tools well I certainly I</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.610" end="00:39:04.150" style="s2">certainly use them to relate to myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.680" end="00:39:07.480" style="s2">so I can share with that and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.150" end="00:39:10.600" style="s2">can see how that resonance with you so</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.480" end="00:39:12.820" style="s2">in fact you&#39;ll see on my signature line</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.600" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">I have what is called my ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.820" end="00:39:19.120" style="s2">justification okay so by justification I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:21.310" style="s2">mean my propositional guide which is to</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.280" end="00:45:55.450" style="s2">hardness right and but not in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.100" end="00:45:59.740" style="s2">further traumatizes oneself but that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.450" end="00:46:00.820" style="s2">does hold you to account and it strikes</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">me that there&#39;s a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.820" end="00:46:09.180" style="s2">this dynamic and the feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:12.130" style="s2">features of reality that we encounter in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.180" end="00:46:15.670" style="s2">terms of how we meet that the unknown in</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.130" end="00:46:19.450" style="s2">terms of how we come to know ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.670" end="00:46:24.550" style="s2">in part due to being presented by things</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.450" end="00:46:27.400" style="s2">about ourselves we didn&#39;t know and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.550" end="00:46:29.380" style="s2">is a bit of a link to the problem some</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.400" end="00:46:32.350" style="s2">problems with psychology but of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.380" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">psychology is we can you know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.350" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">is an interesting thing but if we say</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">some sort of discipline or interest area</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:41.470" style="s2">and coming to understand the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:43.330" style="s2">what the human being you can&#39;t even say</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.470" end="00:46:44.410" style="s2">as behavior because it&#39;s like we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.330" end="00:46:46.060" style="s2">talk about behavior but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.410" end="00:46:48.210" style="s2">also the inner psychic life and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.060" end="00:46:51.270" style="s2">this is deeper sense of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.210" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">what is it all about and so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.270" end="00:46:58.140" style="s2">difficult thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.970" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a it&#39;s probably an</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.140" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">interesting personal story there for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.970" end="00:47:07.740" style="s2">as to how you came to break from</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">traditional understandings in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:11.099" style="s2">at least I mean it seems to me that in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:13.980" style="s2">the middle of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.099" end="00:47:16.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a pretty like this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.980" end="00:47:19.530" style="s2">the functionalism positivism behaviorism</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.770" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">that had been kind of dominant in both</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.530" end="00:47:24.030" style="s2">philosophy of mind philosophy and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:26.550" style="s2">psychology man that stuff to me is just</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.030" end="00:47:28.170" style="s2">like whoa guys what like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.550" end="00:47:33.270" style="s2">missing something that happens right at</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.170" end="00:47:35.130" style="s2">there you know go to university and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.270" end="00:47:37.320" style="s2">study after a lot of that happen so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.130" end="00:47:38.970" style="s2">can maybe it&#39;s a bit easier to say when</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.320" end="00:47:40.830" style="s2">there are people that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.970" end="00:47:43.370" style="s2">turning around going yeah yeah we kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.830" end="00:47:45.859" style="s2">of bit of a joke about that one sorry</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.370" end="00:47:49.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.859" end="00:47:54.270" style="s2">but how do you how do you relate then to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.160" end="00:47:56.040" style="s2">- can we can we say here it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.270" end="00:47:59.070" style="s2">almost like how do we relate to our own</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.040" end="00:48:02.700" style="s2">dissonance you know how do we trust</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.070" end="00:48:05.849" style="s2">ourselves through our failures yes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.700" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">maintain integrity I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.849" end="00:48:09.480" style="s2">yes well first off let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:13.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.480" end="00:48:16.080" style="s2">of psychology it&#39;s freaking complicated</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.790" end="00:48:19.140" style="s2">it&#39;s the intersection of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.080" end="00:48:21.990" style="s2">different you know lines of analytic law</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.140" end="00:48:25.080" style="s2">it&#39;s an intersection of you have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.990" end="00:48:26.760" style="s2">deep subjective experience problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.080" end="00:48:29.550" style="s2">relative just say if you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.760" end="00:48:31.619" style="s2">science from a third-person objective</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.550" end="00:48:34.710" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s that nightmare yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.619" end="00:48:38.359" style="s2">deep issues of value problems and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.710" end="00:48:40.530" style="s2">relationship to you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.359" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">predetermine what is good we have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.530" end="00:48:43.619" style="s2">intuitive sense of what it&#39;s good we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.960" style="s2">don&#39;t determine that scientifically we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.619" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">determine that morally and ethically you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:51.240" style="s2">don&#39;t scientifically determine somebody</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.619" style="s2">is a priori healthy or good we have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.240" end="00:48:54.119" style="s2">sense of what healthy good is and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.619" end="00:48:56.970" style="s2">we have variables that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.119" end="00:48:59.070" style="s2">with that but that&#39;s a different so so</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.970" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">how you know and so then we&#39;re how do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.070" end="00:49:04.730" style="s2">apply the values and the understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:06.530" style="s2">to ourselves and then wrestle with all</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.730" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">the things they don&#39;t like determinism</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.530" end="00:49:09.500" style="s2">in freewill and what can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:12.560" style="s2">account for and are we just doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.500" end="00:49:16.250" style="s2">pragmatic stuff or we really I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.560" end="00:49:18.590" style="s2">a nightmare you know I feel like I cut</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.250" end="00:49:21.520" style="s2">through a lot of that confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.590" end="00:49:27.530" style="s2">created coherence in silicon so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.520" end="00:49:31.700" style="s2">that was exciting and it turns out not</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.530" end="00:49:33.380" style="s2">at the I will simply say just to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.700" end="00:49:37.310" style="s2">to some of your concern there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:39.080" style="s2">dialectic you know between when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.310" end="00:49:41.690" style="s2">dealing with ourselves and I say this as</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.080" end="00:49:45.580" style="s2">a therapist okay there&#39;s a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.690" end="00:49:47.990" style="s2">between challenge and support okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:51.140" style="s2">dialectics so you want to be loved and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.990" end="00:49:53.450" style="s2">you want to be challenged by your</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.140" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">coaches and your parents and the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">who love you right and what you want and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:00.950" style="s2">you want to do that to yourself in other</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:03.020" style="s2">words they&#39;re the part of you they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.950" end="00:50:04.610" style="s2">the the individuals who who will move</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.020" end="00:50:06.380" style="s2">you and move yourself are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.610" end="00:50:08.780" style="s2">accept you and love you both for who you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.380" end="00:50:14.630" style="s2">are and challenge you to be what you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.780" end="00:50:17.870" style="s2">be that&#39;s why I try to do myself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.630" end="00:50:19.430" style="s2">why I try with my kids and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.870" end="00:50:22.460" style="s2">I&#39;m being related to in some of the best</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.430" end="00:50:26.060" style="s2">ways when other people are doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.460" end="00:50:28.310" style="s2">beautiful beautiful yeah so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.060" end="00:50:30.970" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s in terms of the pragmatics</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.310" end="00:50:33.320" style="s2">the practical reason that&#39;s a distilled</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.970" end="00:50:38.450" style="s2">practical recent dialectic that I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.320" end="00:50:41.030" style="s2">offer there&#39;s also then the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.450" end="00:50:43.430" style="s2">reason I mean that goes into the problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.030" end="00:50:45.530" style="s2">of psychology and indeed what happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.430" end="00:50:49.580" style="s2">to me in graduate school as a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.530" end="00:50:51.350" style="s2">I was learning to do therapy in this you</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.580" end="00:50:53.360" style="s2">know we can decide how long to go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.350" end="00:50:54.620" style="s2">this but basically the short story was</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.360" end="00:50:56.740" style="s2">is that I was learning that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.620" end="00:51:00.140" style="s2">lot of value in the various perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.740" end="00:51:01.880" style="s2">okay so the updated Neo Freudian</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.140" end="00:51:04.250" style="s2">perspective psychodynamic you that hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.880" end="00:51:07.610" style="s2">that has a lot of interesting value the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.250" end="00:51:09.470" style="s2">shadow people justify and ya for it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.610" end="00:51:11.870" style="s2">extreme in some ways but man you know he</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.470" end="00:51:14.090" style="s2">and then people like Karen Horn I and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.870" end="00:51:15.690" style="s2">modern Freudian theorist you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.090" end="00:51:18.869" style="s2">of interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.690" end="00:51:22.109" style="s2">I was drawn to cognitive therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.869" end="00:51:25.289" style="s2">ideas from Beck and Ellis and stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.109" end="00:51:27.569" style="s2">and how to justify your your position</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.289" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">and interpretation in a way that is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.569" end="00:51:32.549" style="s2">emotionally and behaviorally healthy the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:33.990" style="s2">humanistic tradition you know I mean all</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.549" end="00:51:36.900" style="s2">good therapy for me starts with Carl</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.990" end="00:51:40.230" style="s2">Rogers the Carl Rogers capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.900" end="00:51:42.359" style="s2">empathy and authenticity and holding</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.230" end="00:51:43.829" style="s2">that relational value that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.359" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">Carlos didn&#39;t call it that but he called</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.829" end="00:51:48.210" style="s2">it the organism evaluate process that he</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:50.460" style="s2">would not judge but create a context of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.210" end="00:51:51.569" style="s2">relational mirroring projects to grow so</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.460" end="00:51:56.940" style="s2">I can that&#39;s just beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.569" end="00:51:59.369" style="s2">hmm and so you have you know and scare I</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.940" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">mean scare was unbelievably insightful</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.369" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">for a long time I was armwrestling most</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.609" style="s2">was skinner I finally understood what</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:07.710" style="s2">the hell he was talking about because</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.609" end="00:52:09.390" style="s2">this anti mentalism pissed the shit out</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.710" end="00:52:11.220" style="s2">of me and I was like you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.390" end="00:52:13.140" style="s2">missing half the goddamn boat and then I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.220" end="00:52:15.150" style="s2">realized his brilliance of what he</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.140" end="00:52:17.490" style="s2">actually was seeing from a position I</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.150" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">hadn&#39;t seen originally in the night so</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.490" end="00:52:21.029" style="s2">anyway the point is is that you know how</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">would you articulate that that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.029" end="00:52:24.779" style="s2">interesting to me how would you how</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:27.150" style="s2">would you if you don&#39;t mind how would</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.779" end="00:52:28.710" style="s2">you what is could Skinner someone as</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.150" end="00:52:30.329" style="s2">well that I was just like obviously</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.710" end="00:52:32.390" style="s2">loads of great research super</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.329" end="00:52:35.970" style="s2">interesting stuff but come on my way</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.390" end="00:52:38.190" style="s2">right okay so so basically skaters</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.970" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">okay so Skinner is taking a hard and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.190" end="00:52:43.289" style="s2">pure asses of view of science and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:44.279" style="s2">the philosophy of behavior which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.289" end="00:52:47.099" style="s2">basically they&#39;re going to take a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.279" end="00:52:49.700" style="s2">third-person exterior view and my job as</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.099" end="00:52:52.380" style="s2">a psychologist is to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.700" end="00:52:55.730" style="s2">contingencies in response to your</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.380" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">responses that change your response rate</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.730" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what he was trying to do and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:03.089" style="s2">what he does is he gets rid of Watson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:04.680" style="s2">so Watson the first behaviors has this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.089" end="00:53:06.809" style="s2">idea that inside of you are all these</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.680" end="00:53:08.579" style="s2">neuro mechanical reflexes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.809" end="00:53:12.390" style="s2">somehow going off through Association</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.579" end="00:53:15.059" style="s2">that&#39;s Watson that&#39;s just dumb okay I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.390" end="00:53:18.660" style="s2">hope your podcast oh man never so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.059" end="00:53:20.220" style="s2">please go ahead so that&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.660" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">that&#39;s just trying to create raw</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.220" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">physical reductionism into the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:25.799" style="s2">system that&#39;s just you all Skinner who</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:28.440" style="s2">gets rid of that he jettisons all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.799" end="00:53:30.839" style="s2">that his philosophy and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">behavior by which he defines it as the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.839" end="00:53:35.369" style="s2">function of the operant okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.930" end="00:53:37.770" style="s2">very complicated concept once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.369" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">been what you really diet the operant is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.770" end="00:53:42.210" style="s2">the thing that the organism is operating</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:45.060" style="s2">on and the contingencies that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.210" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">operation produces I&#39;ll say that again</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.060" end="00:53:48.420" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that the organism is</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:52.470" style="s2">operating on and the contingencies of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.420" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">that operation that it produces okay so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.470" end="00:53:55.589" style="s2">here&#39;s the example I give people people</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:57.630" style="s2">think about skinner in terms of oh you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.589" end="00:53:58.339" style="s2">know you get stickers or you do all this</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.630" end="00:54:00.329" style="s2">other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.339" end="00:54:02.190" style="s2">imagine you&#39;re writing along here I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.329" end="00:54:04.530" style="s2">a pen right here but right now long down</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.190" end="00:54:08.040" style="s2">here and this and what is going on when</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.530" end="00:54:09.720" style="s2">I&#39;m h marking stuff on the page okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.040" end="00:54:13.349" style="s2">writing and I&#39;m seeing the ink on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.720" end="00:54:15.150" style="s2">page so the ink is a function my</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.349" end="00:54:17.160" style="s2">behavior is a function of that operon</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.150" end="00:54:19.099" style="s2">and as soon as that pen runs out of ink</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.160" end="00:54:23.910" style="s2">and it stops writing guess what happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.099" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">my writing behavior stops okay you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.910" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">see that actually the ink is a salient</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:32.910" style="s2">control external variable okay that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:35.400" style="s2">eating back on my behavior alright and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.910" end="00:54:39.260" style="s2">creating that&#39;s creating a reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.400" end="00:54:42.329" style="s2">control on what it is that I&#39;m investing</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.260" end="00:54:44.369" style="s2">yes i extent so it says linker a link of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.329" end="00:54:46.890" style="s2">interdependency it&#39;s a link of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.369" end="00:54:48.630" style="s2">interdependence ii and and i i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.890" end="00:54:50.280" style="s2">gonna focus on what you&#39;re feeling are</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.630" end="00:54:52.859" style="s2">but all I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m gonna watch</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.280" end="00:54:55.740" style="s2">you on a video and I&#39;m gonna see the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.859" end="00:54:57.960" style="s2">Saleen control variables that you try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.740" end="00:54:59.700" style="s2">produce and then the impact that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.960" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">has on the frequencies of behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.700" end="00:55:05.819" style="s2">you emit mm-hmm-hmm which then he does</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:07.710" style="s2">Skinner should have used this term but</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.819" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">he was so anti mentalistic so this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.710" end="00:55:12.450" style="s2">what I discovered us called the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:14.250" style="s2">behavioral investment theory okay which</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.450" end="00:55:18.780" style="s2">basically says that your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.250" end="00:55:21.510" style="s2">is an investment value system okay an</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.780" end="00:55:22.980" style="s2">investment value system alright which</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.510" end="00:55:24.780" style="s2">actually connects you were talking with</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.980" end="00:55:28.410" style="s2">John for a key about Heidegger&#39;s concept</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.780" end="00:55:31.079" style="s2">of care the investment value system is</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.410" end="00:55:33.060" style="s2">actually this system cares about where</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.079" end="00:55:35.790" style="s2">you&#39;re going to direct your work effort</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.060" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">I&#39;ll say that again it cares about where</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.790" end="00:55:39.869" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna direct your work effort</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:43.019" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.869" end="00:55:46.079" style="s2">and or your entire behavioral system is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.019" end="00:55:48.289" style="s2">basically an energy economic system all</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:52.039" style="s2">right that is trying to expend energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.289" end="00:55:55.380" style="s2">based on things like time okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.039" end="00:55:59.190" style="s2">opportunity costs risks and what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.380" end="00:56:03.779" style="s2">decide is relevant for the outcomes that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.190" end="00:56:05.999" style="s2">you&#39;re working to produce okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.779" end="00:56:08.579" style="s2">have from a cognitive perspective you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.999" end="00:56:12.900" style="s2">have a hierarchical system of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.579" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">realizers Godlove Jon right that allows</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.900" end="00:56:17.789" style="s2">you to detect what are the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:19.829" style="s2">and salient indicators of information</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.789" end="00:56:22.740" style="s2">that allow you to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.829" end="00:56:25.019" style="s2">efficiently and spend work energy to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.740" end="00:56:26.849" style="s2">the control that you want that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.019" end="00:56:30.150" style="s2">cup of view okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.849" end="00:56:32.759" style="s2">neurocognitive functionalism so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.150" end="00:56:34.950" style="s2">what Neurosci burnett ik people at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.759" end="00:56:36.930" style="s2">now the 4e cognitive people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.950" end="00:56:39.089" style="s2">realizing that the nervous system is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.930" end="00:56:42.150" style="s2">neuroscientific system okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.089" end="00:56:43.829" style="s2">embodied and enacting and fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.150" end="00:56:45.989" style="s2">behavioral it&#39;s this neural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.829" end="00:56:47.970" style="s2">functional system okay so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.989" end="00:56:49.769" style="s2">actually becoming behavioral in many</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.970" end="00:56:52.829" style="s2">ways they were up here at the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.769" end="00:56:55.380" style="s2">function level as like AI and 4e brings</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.829" end="00:56:57.839" style="s2">you into the perspective of procedural</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.380" end="00:56:59.249" style="s2">embody listen to the way John talks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.839" end="00:57:02.069" style="s2">not all a proposition is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.249" end="00:57:04.349" style="s2">participatory well actually when you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.069" end="00:57:06.630" style="s2">into a John Salkin you&#39;re actually now</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.349" end="00:57:08.730" style="s2">as I told him you&#39;re now jumping into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.630" end="00:57:12.119" style="s2">skin Aryan view from a third-person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.730" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s mentalistic lee cold but it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.119" end="00:57:16.769" style="s2">third-person observation Lee Keeney and</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:18.869" style="s2">it attends to the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.769" end="00:57:20.700" style="s2">contingencies that are the salient</p>

<p begin="00:57:20.700" end="00:57:25.619" style="s2">perspective so it&#39;s watching what are</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.670" end="00:57:27.569" style="s2">the key variables that are enacting and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.619" end="00:57:31.619" style="s2">soliciting in him you&#39;re emitting</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.619" end="00:57:35.099" style="s2">make it does make sense I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.299" end="00:57:36.779" style="s2">really awesome articulation thank you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.099" end="00:57:39.299" style="s2">for connecting those dots to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.779" end="00:57:41.549" style="s2">particularly that all of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.299" end="00:57:44.999" style="s2">architecture connects through Skinner in</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.549" end="00:57:48.089" style="s2">that way it does strike me that there</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.999" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">and and here might take us on in your</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.089" end="00:57:52.109" style="s2">intellectual story a little bit perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:53.650" style="s2">although I&#39;m not sure and that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.109" end="00:57:55.809" style="s2">because I I know there</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.650" end="00:58:02.529" style="s2">there&#39;s more to come I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.809" end="00:58:04.569" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a long story friend well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.529" end="00:58:07.779" style="s2">we can do we can have another and and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.569" end="00:58:10.259" style="s2">and so the thing is is that okay maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.779" end="00:58:16.299" style="s2">maybe just to throw just to lob a few</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.259" end="00:58:18.900" style="s2">balls at you then novelty as experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.299" end="00:58:21.720" style="s2">subjectively and perhaps as a domain or</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.900" end="00:58:28.150" style="s2">potentiality as a domain metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.720" end="00:58:30.249" style="s2">and also the it&#39;s a lot of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.150" end="00:58:31.660" style="s2">been writing about recently not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.249" end="00:58:36.369" style="s2">publishing anywhere just really trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.660" end="00:58:39.269" style="s2">to make makino articulations after years</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.369" end="00:58:42.849" style="s2">of trying to understand this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.269" end="00:58:44.769" style="s2">regarding then regarding or I referred</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.849" end="00:58:49.680" style="s2">to as from one level modes of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.769" end="00:58:55.259" style="s2">orientation so how we like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.680" end="00:58:57.660" style="s2">the essential elements of orientation in</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.259" end="00:59:02.739" style="s2">experience itself like um as as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.660" end="00:59:04.269" style="s2">conscious entity and it struck it has a</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.739" end="00:59:06.220" style="s2">little bit to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.269" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">not quite ly the mapping is not quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.220" end="00:59:11.619" style="s2">one-to-one but this challenge support</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:18.089" style="s2">dynamic is helpful to explain a part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.619" end="00:59:21.400" style="s2">a particular mode but we we encounter</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.089" end="00:59:24.220" style="s2">things we don&#39;t understand we encounter</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.400" end="00:59:28.299" style="s2">others in relation and yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.220" end="00:59:30.220" style="s2">consistently undergoing this up and down</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.299" end="00:59:33.549" style="s2">the stack relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="01:00:00.700" style="s2">stack and we&#39;re responding to each other</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.859" end="01:00:05.010" style="s2">like this and then there&#39;s well what</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.700" end="01:00:09.930" style="s2">does what does attending to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.010" end="01:00:12.360" style="s2">with what building skillfulness in</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.930" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">discernment in this process what does</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.360" end="01:00:17.340" style="s2">that look like to what degree is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:21.410" style="s2">being of us alright the subjectivity of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.340" end="01:00:24.660" style="s2">of us involved what degree can we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.410" end="01:00:28.650" style="s2">agency what is choice like how can we</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.660" end="01:00:30.690" style="s2">invoke participate in our choosing use</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.650" end="01:00:33.330" style="s2">like the the fund get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.690" end="01:00:37.050" style="s2">the fundament of choice is to help</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.330" end="01:00:39.180" style="s2">discern how to inform perhaps even a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.050" end="01:00:41.010" style="s2">small way but it&#39;s happening the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.180" end="01:00:42.540" style="s2">metacognitive observer perhaps is part</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.010" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">of what you will come out with this with</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.540" end="01:00:47.670" style="s2">but that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:51.330" style="s2">in sort of going you know maybe not see</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.670" end="01:00:56.940" style="s2">this okay so lots of things there lots</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.330" end="01:01:01.530" style="s2">of balls first thing I want to do is I</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.940" end="01:01:05.070" style="s2">want to layer the behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.530" end="01:01:07.110" style="s2">system okay on a layer it and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.070" end="01:01:10.050" style="s2">layer it because if we don&#39;t layer it</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.110" end="01:01:11.640" style="s2">will get confused about because they</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.050" end="01:01:13.350" style="s2">different different layers operate in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.640" end="01:01:16.770" style="s2">different ways okay so let me Olivia</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.350" end="01:01:19.860" style="s2">give me at least three layers okay so</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.770" end="01:01:23.000" style="s2">one layer is your you in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.860" end="01:01:26.220" style="s2">the material environment as a perceiver</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.000" end="01:01:27.690" style="s2">okay so now here you are we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.220" end="01:01:29.220" style="s2">talking about a relational layer we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.690" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">talking about you in the material</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.220" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">environment as an animal entity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:38.430" style="s2">moving around okay and has given given</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:41.100" style="s2">rise you&#39;ve given rise to at this stage</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.430" end="01:01:42.510" style="s2">in the game let&#39;s say you&#39;re we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.100" end="01:01:44.310" style="s2">talking about social relations you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.510" end="01:01:47.250" style="s2">mammal and you&#39;re just navigating the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.310" end="01:01:49.580" style="s2">environment okay you have a you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.250" end="01:01:51.660" style="s2">respectable view which means that</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.580" end="01:01:55.470" style="s2">consciousness what I actually call mine</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.660" end="01:01:58.170" style="s2">to I have in three different minds I use</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.470" end="01:02:00.420" style="s2">in terms of defining domains of mental</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.170" end="01:02:02.850" style="s2">process my one refers to the basic</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.420" end="01:02:06.090" style="s2">neurocognitive functionalist view that</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.850" end="01:02:07.980" style="s2">regulates procedural behavior okay and</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.090" end="01:02:10.230" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s what so this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.980" end="01:02:13.860" style="s2">before you have anything that would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.230" end="01:02:16.550" style="s2">an internal experience being you know at</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.860" end="01:02:18.140" style="s2">the most basic level you have snails and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.550" end="01:02:20.809" style="s2">jellyfish engaged</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.140" end="01:02:24.019" style="s2">you know reflexes withdrawal mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.809" end="01:02:25.849" style="s2">these are basically the neural cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.019" end="01:02:27.650" style="s2">reflexive loops that are at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.849" end="01:02:29.750" style="s2">foundation of neural network building</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.650" end="01:02:33.140" style="s2">and they&#39;re I would consider them the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.750" end="01:02:34.760" style="s2">pre phenomenological no grain here no</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.140" end="01:02:36.980" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely nothing that would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.760" end="01:02:39.160" style="s2">an internal experience of being that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.980" end="01:02:41.480" style="s2">would relate to as our internal</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.160" end="01:02:43.730" style="s2">phenomenology okay so no human</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.480" end="01:02:45.380" style="s2">phenomenology here and and not even</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.730" end="01:02:47.329" style="s2">animal phenomenology you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.380" end="01:02:49.400" style="s2">you know you get an early brain when</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.329" end="01:02:51.890" style="s2">phenomenology emerges but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.400" end="01:02:55.250" style="s2">say that phenomenology is present so</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.890" end="01:02:56.599" style="s2">that we can answer your question okay um</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.250" end="01:02:58.069" style="s2">so we could relate to it so what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.599" end="01:03:01.130" style="s2">what do you have here is you have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.069" end="01:03:04.309" style="s2">perception mechanism okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.130" end="01:03:06.410" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to map and predict what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.309" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s going to be that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.410" end="01:03:09.559" style="s2">essentially what you&#39;re you have an</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:12.769" style="s2">investment value system has to determine</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.559" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">what is relevant okay and what it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.769" end="01:03:16.670" style="s2">doing is its determining what it knows</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:18.440" style="s2">what it relative to what it doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.670" end="01:03:20.510" style="s2">and by the way your comment about</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.440" end="01:03:21.859" style="s2">novelty is really key here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.510" end="01:03:25.720" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what&#39;s going to give</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.859" end="01:03:28.339" style="s2">rise to almost certainly consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.720" end="01:03:30.500" style="s2">experiential consciousness is a layering</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.339" end="01:03:32.690" style="s2">of novelty about checking wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.500" end="01:03:35.150" style="s2">if it&#39;s an automatic perceptional key</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.690" end="01:03:36.680" style="s2">that fits you just file it away in your</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.150" end="01:03:38.269" style="s2">procedural memory you don&#39;t pay any</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.680" end="01:03:41.150" style="s2">attention to it it&#39;s when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.269" end="01:03:43.160" style="s2">sure you need to pull particular working</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.150" end="01:03:44.630" style="s2">memory systems together to determine</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.160" end="01:03:47.779" style="s2">what it is that actually you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.630" end="01:03:49.519" style="s2">it&#39;s that onboard memory perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.779" end="01:03:51.140" style="s2">system that&#39;s connecting to your</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.519" end="01:03:52.220" style="s2">episodic memory that allows you to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.140" end="01:03:54.799" style="s2">actually have the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.220" end="01:03:56.420" style="s2">experience of being okay almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.799" end="01:03:58.549" style="s2">certainly that&#39;s it&#39;s a global there or</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.420" end="01:04:01.339" style="s2">the workspace is the technical term for</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.549" end="01:04:03.230" style="s2">that but anyway you basically have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.339" end="01:04:05.420" style="s2">perceptual system that&#39;s tracking and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.230" end="01:04:07.579" style="s2">that&#39;s referencing against what your</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.420" end="01:04:09.470" style="s2">goal state is okay you have an intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.579" end="01:04:11.029" style="s2">Drive goal state you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.470" end="01:04:13.250" style="s2">approach certain relations with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.029" end="01:04:16.220" style="s2">environment and avoid other relations</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.250" end="01:04:18.619" style="s2">okay so if you&#39;re horny you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.220" end="01:04:21.230" style="s2">approaching sex right if you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.619" end="01:04:23.150" style="s2">you&#39;re approaching getting hurt at some</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.230" end="01:04:25.970" style="s2">particular level all right so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.150" end="01:04:27.470" style="s2">in a prey-predator relationship if</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.970" end="01:04:28.730" style="s2">you&#39;re the prey you&#39;re in an avoidance</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.470" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">mode if you&#39;re the predator you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.730" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">approach okay so this</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:36.650" style="s2">prep you to Mook see and then in</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.700" style="s2">relationship to your goal template and</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.650" end="01:04:39.340" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do with approach</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.700" end="01:04:42.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to reduce that discrepancy</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.340" end="01:04:45.500" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s ultimately emotion is</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.800" end="01:04:48.680" style="s2">the desire you get when you energize</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.500" end="01:04:50.420" style="s2">toward your goal state okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.680" end="01:04:52.970" style="s2">so when the cat sees the mouse he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.420" end="01:04:55.280" style="s2">gaining on it he&#39;s gaining that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.970" end="01:04:59.330" style="s2">experience of approach and desire and</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.280" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">pounces the mouse on the other hand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.330" end="01:05:08.180" style="s2">like trying to create a distance freeze</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:10.820" style="s2">jerk you know anything that expands the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.180" end="01:05:12.710" style="s2">distance okay and if as them as the cat</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.820" end="01:05:15.380" style="s2">closes from the mouse perspective the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.710" end="01:05:17.630" style="s2">mouse gets all free and then energizes</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.380" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">with avoidance emotion which is fear</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.630" end="01:05:23.540" style="s2">fundamentally an escape okay versus</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:25.180" style="s2">approach and desire so so you what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.540" end="01:05:29.270" style="s2">have there that&#39;s the perception</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.180" end="01:05:33.910" style="s2">motivation emotion formula that&#39;s basic</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.270" end="01:05:36.410" style="s2">to navigating the world as an animal and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.910" end="01:05:38.330" style="s2">and then not what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.410" end="01:05:40.310" style="s2">the perceptual system is tracking the</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.310" end="01:05:48.830" style="s2">novelty it creates an attentional shift</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.950" end="01:05:50.990" style="s2">that then brings a layering of</p>

<p begin="01:05:50.990" end="01:05:55.369" style="s2">to try to frame that and the reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.570" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">attentional is because this motivational</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:00.619" style="s2">is like okay we have these drives to</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.570" end="01:06:13.730" style="s2">jump up a layer okay now you jump up a</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.320" end="01:06:15.230" style="s2">layer now you&#39;re start talking about</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.859" end="01:06:22.420" style="s2">material world now we&#39;re gonna actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.119" end="01:06:24.859" style="s2">talk about your conspecific relations</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.420" end="01:06:26.600" style="s2">meaning these are the these are the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.859" end="01:06:28.940" style="s2">social relations now we&#39;re in a group</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.600" end="01:06:31.430" style="s2">like that boons okay that have</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.940" end="01:06:33.980" style="s2">long-standing social relations that have</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.430" end="01:06:38.359" style="s2">to navigate their cooperation and their</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.980" end="01:06:40.700" style="s2">competition each other and and how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.359" end="01:06:42.470" style="s2">care for each other and how to deceive</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.700" end="01:06:44.450" style="s2">each other and how to navigate all of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.470" end="01:06:45.859" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.450" end="01:06:47.720" style="s2">and that is where you want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.859" end="01:06:49.609" style="s2">kind of position yourself socially so</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.720" end="01:06:51.650" style="s2">virtually all of what we experience a</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.609" end="01:06:53.750" style="s2">relationship to our intuitive sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.650" end="01:06:56.690" style="s2">self-esteem our self-worth</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.750" end="01:06:58.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a socio-emotional process I built a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.690" end="01:07:00.710" style="s2">thing called the influence matrix which</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.490" end="01:07:02.660" style="s2">actually Maps the internal working</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.710" end="01:07:05.410" style="s2">models of self and relationship to other</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.660" end="01:07:08.450" style="s2">on things like dominance and Submission</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.410" end="01:07:11.180" style="s2">affiliation and hostility autonomy and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.450" end="01:07:13.490" style="s2">dependency and actually all of those are</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.180" end="01:07:16.310" style="s2">in the service of us tracking our degree</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.490" end="01:07:17.660" style="s2">of social influence and relational value</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.310" end="01:07:20.150" style="s2">it&#39;s called the black line on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.660" end="01:07:21.650" style="s2">influence matrix and basically what it</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.150" end="01:07:24.859" style="s2">says is what you&#39;re trying to look for</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.650" end="01:07:26.720" style="s2">is relational value and social influence</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.859" end="01:07:28.250" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what your that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.720" end="01:07:30.770" style="s2">approach and what you&#39;re trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.250" end="01:07:32.210" style="s2">is diminishment of relational value or</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.770" end="01:07:36.740" style="s2">loss of social influence</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.210" end="01:07:37.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the avoid piece okay but you</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.740" end="01:07:40.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t start to think about well how do</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.880" end="01:07:42.380" style="s2">i how do I hold myself accountable and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.460" end="01:07:44.990" style="s2">Who am I what do I want to be these are</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.380" end="01:07:48.740" style="s2">all internal working models intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.990" end="01:07:50.990" style="s2">that are going to guide you and then the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.740" end="01:07:54.500" style="s2">final layer is now we get into a human</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.990" end="01:07:56.569" style="s2">layer okay what I call ultimately mine 3</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.500" end="01:08:00.109" style="s2">which is self conscious narration and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.569" end="01:08:03.020" style="s2">justification ok mine 3 is when the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.109" end="01:08:05.960" style="s2">system can actually become you know the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.020" end="01:08:08.450" style="s2">I now it&#39;s not just me it&#39;s I in</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.960" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">relationship to me and I have I have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.450" end="01:08:14.359" style="s2">self reflective capacity to look back on</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:15.859" style="s2">myself and start making judgments and</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.359" end="01:08:18.200" style="s2">very importantly I have the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.859" end="01:08:20.839" style="s2">process by which I justify myself to</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.200" end="01:08:22.489" style="s2">other people okay so now other people</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.839" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">who are me accountable in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.489" end="01:08:26.600" style="s2">what you learn first as a young kid your</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:28.580" style="s2">parents and your friends and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.600" end="01:08:29.779" style="s2">holds you accountable and says well why</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.580" end="01:08:31.190" style="s2">did you this and why didn&#39;t you do this</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.779" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">so you&#39;ll be punished if you do this so</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.190" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">you say well I did this because I did</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:38.239" style="s2">this because and I&#39;m a justifier okay as</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:39.710" style="s2">a social actor on a stage that says oh</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.239" end="01:08:42.230" style="s2">you know I&#39;m trying to do my best</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.710" end="01:08:44.029" style="s2">alright and and you learn to justify</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.230" end="01:08:46.160" style="s2">yourself and then you learn and really</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.029" end="01:08:47.270" style="s2">adolescence is the developmental period</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.160" end="01:08:49.790" style="s2">in humans where you really actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.270" end="01:08:51.980" style="s2">formalize this capacity to become a</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.790" end="01:08:53.450" style="s2">consistent self reflective observer</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.980" end="01:08:56.299" style="s2">because there&#39;s what you called the</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.450" end="01:08:57.770" style="s2">adolescent identities like oh shit I in</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.299" end="01:08:59.299" style="s2">this way but I could be some</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.770" end="01:09:01.430" style="s2">being different and you wander around</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.299" end="01:09:02.990" style="s2">with that ability of that self-concept</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.430" end="01:09:05.330" style="s2">that just walks with you and many</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.990" end="01:09:07.250" style="s2">adolescents go neurotic as hell because</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.330" end="01:09:09.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like their self-concept is like oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.250" end="01:09:11.150" style="s2">I wish you were so different and why</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.170" end="01:09:13.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t you&#39;re like Becky she&#39;s all hot</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.150" end="01:09:15.290" style="s2">and popular and you&#39;re ugly and neurotic</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.460" end="01:09:17.900" style="s2">I hate you and your model blonde you</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.290" end="01:09:19.819" style="s2">know they get nasty internalized critic</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.900" end="01:09:21.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s a really really brutal one many</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.819" end="01:09:24.230" style="s2">people but anyway the point of it is is</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.799" end="01:09:25.790" style="s2">then you get that second very reflective</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.230" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">view in mind three where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.790" end="01:09:31.640" style="s2">justifying entity so if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:33.500" style="s2">stack relevance realization mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.640" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">we have to be very clear about where we</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.500" end="01:09:38.240" style="s2">are in the mental domains and processes</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:39.799" style="s2">because they behave differently across</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.240" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">different layers and then they</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.799" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">interrelate</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:48.520" style="s2">hmm well thank you for that articulation</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:48.520" style="s2">that some that&#39;s very very helpful so</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:55.420" style="s2">how to so what comes up for me and just</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.270" end="01:09:58.700" style="s2">to put like some cards on the table so</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.420" end="01:10:01.310" style="s2">to the extent I have a background that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.700" end="01:10:03.110" style="s2">well identifiable from an institutional</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.310" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">perspective I was quite interested in</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.110" end="01:10:15.020" style="s2">philosophy of mind and at least what six</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:18.050" style="s2">six years ago now when I was doing you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.020" end="01:10:19.990" style="s2">know I&#39;m more of a scholarly study of</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.050" end="01:10:23.690" style="s2">different theories and what-have-you I</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.990" end="01:10:28.010" style="s2">at the time was was gravitating strongly</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.690" end="01:10:31.040" style="s2">towards a variant of sort of Pan</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.010" end="01:10:33.440" style="s2">psychism both so but but but really more</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.040" end="01:10:36.380" style="s2">process philosophy so rather than</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.440" end="01:10:40.760" style="s2">looking to try and make sense of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.380" end="01:10:42.710" style="s2">difficult dichotomy or between realism</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.760" end="01:10:44.930" style="s2">idealism and then of course dualism</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.710" end="01:10:47.480" style="s2">making making a third in that case with</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.930" end="01:10:49.370" style="s2">existing kind of metaphysical structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.480" end="01:10:50.930" style="s2">sort of looking at going at it a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.370" end="01:10:52.760" style="s2">different way and not looking at it from</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.930" end="01:10:57.830" style="s2">a substance perspective rather a process</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.760" end="01:11:00.140" style="s2">perspective and and so I am there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.830" end="01:11:02.330" style="s2">parts of being that are built up that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.140" end="01:11:09.050" style="s2">bring to this kind of conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.330" end="01:11:12.559" style="s2">are that that do trigger and wish to you</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.050" end="01:11:20.639" style="s2">know understand a little more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.559" end="01:11:23.929" style="s2">the the territory the that that would</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.639" end="01:11:26.820" style="s2">have us be able to make sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.929" end="01:11:31.170" style="s2">assumptions or statements regarding</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.820" end="01:11:33.710" style="s2">where consciousness pops up but I just</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.170" end="01:11:37.079" style="s2">want to do that as a sort of a sidetrack</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.710" end="01:11:39.989" style="s2">because in some sense consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.079" end="01:11:41.699" style="s2">if it is an objective phenomenon as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.989" end="01:11:43.110" style="s2">as it&#39;s a subjective phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.699" end="01:11:47.190" style="s2">course it&#39;s a very tricky for now</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.110" end="01:11:51.480" style="s2">absolutely yes so it opens wherever you</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.190" end="01:11:55.110" style="s2">are and let&#39;s just dialogue yeah but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.480" end="01:11:57.539" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a really you know a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.110" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">really fruitful way we could go in here</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.539" end="01:12:04.349" style="s2">and that&#39;s to sort of ask you for an</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:06.809" style="s2">understanding of how let&#39;s take mine</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.349" end="01:12:08.940" style="s2">three which just less for people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.809" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">might not be as familiar stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.940" end="01:12:14.730" style="s2">happening in in consciousness the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:16.679" style="s2">we have it right off human language</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.730" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">based self consciousness okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.679" end="01:12:20.519" style="s2">actually it&#39;s Rene de cartes</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:22.889" style="s2">like I think therefore I am but its</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.519" end="01:12:25.199" style="s2">language based and very importantly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.889" end="01:12:27.210" style="s2">everything I could report to you that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.199" end="01:12:30.480" style="s2">you have direct access to in other words</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.210" end="01:12:32.309" style="s2">it is my narrator okay so so it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.480" end="01:12:33.059" style="s2">sounds the same in my head when I say it</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.309" end="01:12:34.230" style="s2">out loud</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.059" end="01:12:36.659" style="s2">which is very different than my</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.230" end="01:12:40.949" style="s2">perspectival consciousness so I just</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.659" end="01:12:42.480" style="s2">write the medium makes a big difference</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.949" end="01:12:44.670" style="s2">so the fact that it&#39;s linguistically</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.480" end="01:12:46.650" style="s2">mediated as opposed to prospectively</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.670" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">mediated that&#39;s actually that carries</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.650" end="01:12:50.130" style="s2">lots of difference not that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:53.039" style="s2">inside my head they&#39;re interrelated of</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.130" end="01:12:54.780" style="s2">course but language only comes out my</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.039" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">perspective never comes out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.780" end="01:12:59.639" style="s2">encapsulated in my I mean directly it</p>

<p begin="01:13:19.409" end="01:13:25.500" style="s2">I share them sure yes thank you sorry</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.219" end="01:13:27.450" style="s2">for the no</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.500" end="01:13:30.000" style="s2">is a new language system but a so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.450" end="01:13:31.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve no apologies I just want to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.000" end="01:13:34.200" style="s2">clear about what it is that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.290" end="01:13:36.810" style="s2">certainly yes absolutely absolutely yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.200" end="01:13:40.200" style="s2">that did lock in with my sense of it I</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.810" end="01:13:42.980" style="s2">was just loose but um yeah so so that</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.200" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">actually gets right to it then so how</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.980" end="01:13:48.300" style="s2">because there is this phenomenon of we</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:49.950" style="s2">and there is also an aspect to this</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.300" end="01:13:51.660" style="s2">discussion that as well we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.950" end="01:13:54.110" style="s2">presents that would be worth kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.660" end="01:13:56.700" style="s2">just present seeing now not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.110" end="01:13:58.230" style="s2">just just to just to get throw this into</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.700" end="01:14:02.490" style="s2">the mix as well and that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.230" end="01:14:04.770" style="s2">spirituality and that&#39;s yes some of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.490" end="01:14:06.990" style="s2">more mystical experiences available to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.770" end="01:14:09.870" style="s2">us and these deeper sense of connect</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.990" end="01:14:13.230" style="s2">connectivity and and meaning associated</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.870" end="01:14:16.260" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something is this</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.230" end="01:14:17.970" style="s2">participation in a shared we right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.260" end="01:14:20.760" style="s2">though I can&#39;t access you directly</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.970" end="01:14:22.770" style="s2">through a kind of relational indirect</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.760" end="01:14:25.560" style="s2">process we can participate in something</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.770" end="01:14:27.450" style="s2">together love that a love jars</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.560" end="01:14:29.340" style="s2">participatory that&#39;s exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.450" end="01:14:31.290" style="s2">and in many ways I would argue my</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.340" end="01:14:34.230" style="s2">behaviors essentially the opposite side</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.290" end="01:14:36.720" style="s2">of my of my coin so we&#39;re and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.230" end="01:14:39.300" style="s2">very yoked in many ways together so yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.720" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">absolutely you I often say to people my</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.300" end="01:14:41.610" style="s2">wife in many ways knows me better than</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.350" end="01:14:50.490" style="s2">observation of me so we can really know</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.210" end="01:14:52.620" style="s2">each other very well I want to be clear</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.490" end="01:14:54.810" style="s2">about that and we can we can know each</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.450" end="01:15:15.870" style="s2">yes so so it would seem to me then I</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.870" end="01:15:19.530" style="s2">right but because I know you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.330" end="01:15:23.310" style="s2">interested in talking about psycho</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.530" end="01:15:25.500" style="s2">technologies and what psycho tech</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.310" end="01:15:27.070" style="s2">technologies might be helpful for today</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.500" end="01:15:32.350" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.070" end="01:15:36.010" style="s2">so it&#39;s like what kind of practice what</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.350" end="01:15:38.920" style="s2">kind of thing can we do or what is there</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.010" end="01:15:44.290" style="s2">to be discovered and how can we and</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.920" end="01:15:50.440" style="s2">build skillfulness in that helps that</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.290" end="01:15:52.870" style="s2">helps us move from its it&#39;s like how do</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.440" end="01:15:55.210" style="s2">we its continuity between these three</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.870" end="01:16:01.270" style="s2">minds in your language hey is it because</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.210" end="01:16:04.210" style="s2">it can it for me it seems well it it</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.270" end="01:16:07.000" style="s2">triggers against some of the axioms that</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.210" end="01:16:09.010" style="s2">I kind of bring to bear if we consider</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.000" end="01:16:11.590" style="s2">things to separately and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.010" end="01:16:15.040" style="s2">you are considering them separately so</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.590" end="01:16:17.260" style="s2">I&#39;m interested I&#39;m a unity non dual yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.040" end="01:16:19.360" style="s2">so I&#39;m interested in I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.260" end="01:16:21.250" style="s2">figure out the words that really to ask</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.360" end="01:16:23.980" style="s2">you how to articulate that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.250" end="01:16:26.700" style="s2">interconnections the continuity and how</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.980" end="01:16:31.660" style="s2">we can transform up and down the stack</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.700" end="01:16:34.270" style="s2">brilliant yeah okay so yes I&#39;m I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.660" end="01:16:37.450" style="s2">substance modest if you want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.270" end="01:16:40.300" style="s2">that our nan duelist in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.450" end="01:16:41.680" style="s2">although the world is it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.300" end="01:16:46.060" style="s2">because there&#39;s epistemological and</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.680" end="01:16:48.490" style="s2">ontological meanings to sort out one of</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:57.820" style="s2">is called informational interface okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.950" end="01:17:00.190" style="s2">informational interface is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.820" end="01:17:03.010" style="s2">translation between information</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.190" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">processing systems and the interface</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.010" end="01:17:10.330" style="s2">between them okay if you appreciate like</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:13.060" style="s2">my system emphasizes Marshall McLuhan</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.330" end="01:17:16.720" style="s2">would appreciate this that the medium of</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.060" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">information transfer is key for its</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.720" end="01:17:23.740" style="s2">language is different than phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:26.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s okay and once you then sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.740" end="01:17:28.510" style="s2">out the information processing language</p>

<p begin="01:20:06.520" end="01:20:10.870" style="s2">like locked up with yours my mind three</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.920" end="01:20:13.180" style="s2">has created a highway of information and</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.870" end="01:20:15.239" style="s2">and we have downloaded each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.180" end="01:20:17.070" style="s2">informational systems in our and our</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.239" end="01:20:19.570" style="s2">phenomenologically move and</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.070" end="01:20:25.239" style="s2">physiologically moved as a function of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.570" end="01:20:29.080" style="s2">that is blatantly obvious why the hell</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.239" end="01:20:31.989" style="s2">we on the conversation yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.080" end="01:20:34.690" style="s2">that&#39;s all that&#39;s all that all makes a</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.989" end="01:20:38.050" style="s2">lot of sense to me so so if we take if</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.690" end="01:20:41.860" style="s2">we take mind one then this um this</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.050" end="01:20:44.440" style="s2">perceiver of world this this responsible</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.860" end="01:20:46.810" style="s2">for this based participatory relevance</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.440" end="01:20:49.600" style="s2">realization in introns language is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.810" end="01:20:51.340" style="s2">an appropriate mapping just to use yes</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.600" end="01:20:54.670" style="s2">although I want to be clear so really</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.340" end="01:20:58.570" style="s2">mind one the best way to understand mine</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.670" end="01:21:00.489" style="s2">one is what cognitive neuro pathologists</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.570" end="01:21:03.700" style="s2">do an ethologist is a science of animal</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.489" end="01:21:05.410" style="s2">behavior okay that&#39;s ethology or used to</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.700" end="01:21:07.510" style="s2">be called comparative psychology and in</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.410" end="01:21:09.850" style="s2">psychology gave animal behavior over to</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.510" end="01:21:11.290" style="s2">biology which in my system was a trauma</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.850" end="01:21:14.860" style="s2">a tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.290" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">okay so animal behavior should be basic</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.860" end="01:21:21.190" style="s2">psychology but now it&#39;s biology</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:24.310" style="s2">but anyway so so the question is how do</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.190" end="01:21:26.469" style="s2">you understand what animals do from a</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.310" end="01:21:30.610" style="s2">scientific perspective okay that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.469" end="01:21:32.680" style="s2">first question and my one really is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.610" end="01:21:34.469" style="s2">answer to that question so so at a</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.680" end="01:21:37.840" style="s2">simple level they have a nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.469" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">okay so all complex animal behavior is</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.840" end="01:21:42.219" style="s2">mediated through the nervous system in</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:45.400" style="s2">general and brain in particular we know</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.219" end="01:21:47.050" style="s2">that typically okay as for what is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.400" end="01:21:49.060" style="s2">nervous system well it&#39;s this messaging</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.050" end="01:21:51.310" style="s2">information processing system that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.060" end="01:21:53.739" style="s2">functions neuroscience people call it</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.310" end="01:21:55.390" style="s2">the organ of behavior which basically</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.739" end="01:21:57.250" style="s2">basically means this takes the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.390" end="01:21:58.870" style="s2">of animals a hole and moves it around</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.250" end="01:22:00.790" style="s2">so that&#39;s your neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.870" end="01:22:03.460" style="s2">contributions then you have your</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.790" end="01:22:07.680" style="s2">computational cybernetic cognitive folks</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.460" end="01:22:09.660" style="s2">okay who study the nervous system as</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.680" end="01:22:11.490" style="s2">surely an information processing</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.660" end="01:22:14.790" style="s2">computational and cybernetic</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.490" end="01:22:17.450" style="s2">hierarchically control system okay so</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.790" end="01:22:19.260" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.450" end="01:22:21.420" style="s2">neuroscience or computational</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.260" end="01:22:23.160" style="s2">neuroscience people do then what you</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.420" end="01:22:25.700" style="s2">have is you have the behaviorist who</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.160" end="01:22:28.590" style="s2">take animals and put them in the lab and</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.700" end="01:22:32.400" style="s2">create artificial contingencies either</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.590" end="01:22:34.860" style="s2">through association or social networking</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.400" end="01:22:36.930" style="s2">or or reinforcement and then they see</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.860" end="01:22:38.550" style="s2">how their behavior changes and they have</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.930" end="01:22:40.500" style="s2">their language of behavioral science</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.550" end="01:22:43.080" style="s2">which tells you how the language changes</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.500" end="01:22:46.260" style="s2">based on Association contingency usually</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.080" end="01:22:47.730" style="s2">and of course it more advanced now but</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.260" end="01:22:50.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the early language and it still</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.730" end="01:22:53.820" style="s2">builds off of all bullshit okay and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.610" end="01:22:56.430" style="s2">you have ethology most famously like if</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.820" end="01:22:57.930" style="s2">you know somebody like eel Wilson who</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.430" end="01:23:00.000" style="s2">was the socio biologist but he was</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.930" end="01:23:02.390" style="s2">really an apologist in the sense he</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.000" end="01:23:04.650" style="s2">studied ants and social behavior inhales</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.390" end="01:23:06.450" style="s2">the early folks were comparative</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.650" end="01:23:08.340" style="s2">psychologists but anyway why do animals</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.450" end="01:23:10.890" style="s2">do what they do in the world how do you</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.340" end="01:23:13.800" style="s2">understand this I just interesting study</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.890" end="01:23:16.050" style="s2">on bees bees have crossed mental</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.800" end="01:23:18.750" style="s2">modalities where they can recognize an</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.050" end="01:23:21.480" style="s2">hour an hour an object through smell and</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.750" end="01:23:23.220" style="s2">through touch simultaneous you know they</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.480" end="01:23:25.980" style="s2">recognize the same object through sight</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.220" end="01:23:27.870" style="s2">sight or smell I think it was maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.980" end="01:23:29.250" style="s2">was touching sight anyway it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.870" end="01:23:32.300" style="s2">matter they had cross modality</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.250" end="01:23:35.820" style="s2">recognition of an item a be a bumblebee</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.300" end="01:23:37.860" style="s2">that&#39;s what can interesting right he</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.820" end="01:23:40.530" style="s2">knows which is whether it smells it or</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.860" end="01:23:41.850" style="s2">whether I just said it knows that object</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.530" end="01:23:43.770" style="s2">they can that&#39;s how they you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.850" end="01:23:47.040" style="s2">the experiment on it&#39;s called cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.770" end="01:23:50.070" style="s2">ethology which is you know bringing</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.040" end="01:23:54.330" style="s2">cognitive models to demonstrate what</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.070" end="01:23:56.850" style="s2">animals are proceeding so so once you</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.330" end="01:23:58.830" style="s2">see that what the unified theory says is</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.850" end="01:24:00.630" style="s2">actually all of that the meta</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.830" end="01:24:04.380" style="s2">theoretical frame is behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.630" end="01:24:06.090" style="s2">investment theory okay behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.380" end="01:24:09.810" style="s2">investment theory allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.090" end="01:24:13.200" style="s2">scientists to understand animal neuro</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.810" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">mental behavior patterns that&#39;s the so</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.200" end="01:24:19.320" style="s2">it creates a theory that emerges out of</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.780" end="01:24:21.239" style="s2">biology is organizes neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.320" end="01:24:25.469" style="s2">then organizes neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.239" end="01:24:27.749" style="s2">this cybernetic behavioral system okay</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.469" end="01:24:30.030" style="s2">and then that&#39;s called behavioral vespa</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.749" end="01:24:34.050" style="s2">theory and that&#39;s my one and my one</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.030" end="01:24:35.099" style="s2">makes no assertion a priori about the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.050" end="01:24:37.980" style="s2">existence of mind</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.099" end="01:24:41.039" style="s2">- meaning that it doesn&#39;t tell you when</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.980" end="01:24:44.940" style="s2">animals get phenomenological conscious</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.039" end="01:24:46.320" style="s2">awareness okay and the reason is because</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.940" end="01:24:47.969" style="s2">mine too</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.320" end="01:24:52.349" style="s2">is where we get into so many different</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.969" end="01:24:55.559" style="s2">philosophical conundrums alright I often</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.349" end="01:24:57.989" style="s2">say they&#39;re at least two separate hard</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.559" end="01:25:00.860" style="s2">problems of consciousness defined in</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.989" end="01:25:04.230" style="s2">terms of what my my meaning of mine -</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.860" end="01:25:06.809" style="s2">okay so one of them is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.230" end="01:25:08.519" style="s2">epistemological gap problem the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.809" end="01:25:11.610" style="s2">epistemological gap problem is you never</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.519" end="01:25:13.469" style="s2">get to see another entity&#39;s mind -</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.610" end="01:25:15.449" style="s2">directly that&#39;s the nature of it</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.469" end="01:25:18.960" style="s2">epistemological II I can never see</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.449" end="01:25:21.059" style="s2">another entity&#39;s witnessing capacity I</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.960" end="01:25:23.010" style="s2">mean that was Thomas Nagel what does it</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.059" end="01:25:24.570" style="s2">like to be a bat you know he reviews</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.010" end="01:25:27.150" style="s2">that you assume bats have some</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.570" end="01:25:29.159" style="s2">respectable experience witnessing</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.150" end="01:25:31.320" style="s2">function but what the hell is it like</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.159" end="01:25:32.730" style="s2">and how would you know you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.320" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">the epistemological yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.730" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">okay and then the other serious problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.869" style="s2">scientifically is the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:42.630" style="s2">problem which is what exactly are the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.869" end="01:25:46.670" style="s2">brain mechanisms involved in generating</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.630" end="01:25:50.039" style="s2">the felt experienced witnessing function</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.670" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">okay that&#39;s unbelievably that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.039" end="01:25:53.099" style="s2">a brutally hard problem as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:57.630" style="s2">concerned that says it&#39;s the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.099" end="01:25:59.760" style="s2">problem of mind when we box in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.630" end="01:26:02.760" style="s2">correlational stuff of what the brain</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.760" end="01:26:04.499" style="s2">does but it&#39;s still there&#39;s huge amounts</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.760" end="01:26:06.300" style="s2">of debate and rightfully so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.499" end="01:26:09.420" style="s2">combination of the ontological and</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.300" end="01:26:11.909" style="s2">epistemological problems of my to or are</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.420" end="01:26:13.619" style="s2">really you know I can box</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.909" end="01:26:15.719" style="s2">I believe I box it in with the unified</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.619" end="01:26:18.690" style="s2">framework but I don&#39;t answer that those</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.719" end="01:26:20.340" style="s2">things remained big time scientific</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.690" end="01:26:24.059" style="s2">mysteries as far as I&#39;m concerned as</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.340" end="01:26:27.900" style="s2">we&#39;re honing in on them I I consider</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.059" end="01:26:29.880" style="s2">them scientific mysteries so almost stop</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.900" end="01:26:31.979" style="s2">or settle off there at all ya know</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.880" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">beautiful so</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.979" end="01:26:40.229" style="s2">oh let me see so you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:42.780" style="s2">remaining time we have together which</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.229" end="01:26:44.190" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m taking to be maybe thirty</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.780" end="01:26:48.719" style="s2">minutes if I can keep you interested</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.190" end="01:26:50.190" style="s2">enough yeah oh yes I was kids saw that</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.719" end="01:26:52.619" style="s2">you went two hours with John I said I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.190" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">go through hours yeah yeah well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.619" end="01:26:56.159" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting just as an aside</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:58.170" style="s2">point for people listening and my</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.159" end="01:27:00.780" style="s2">experience of group conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.170" end="01:27:03.599" style="s2">dialogues in general the one to two hour</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.780" end="01:27:06.269" style="s2">mark is is when certain things really</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.599" end="01:27:08.219" style="s2">begin to pick up a lot of this is just a</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.269" end="01:27:10.380" style="s2">product of time a like if we really did</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.219" end="01:27:12.179" style="s2">sit down for ten hours together and go</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.380" end="01:27:14.900" style="s2">alright that&#39;s all where would we go is</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.179" end="01:27:14.900" style="s2">an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.289" end="01:27:20.099" style="s2">okay we have to go for food at some</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.699" end="01:27:27.380" style="s2">point yeah right yeah yeah exactly we</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.099" end="01:27:32.519" style="s2">could continue to talk so okay so to</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.380" end="01:27:37.579" style="s2">draw to look out in again to the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.519" end="01:27:42.420" style="s2">and the moment we find ourselves in now</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.579" end="01:27:46.739" style="s2">one that threatens fractionation to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.420" end="01:27:48.570" style="s2">point of destabilization which may</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.739" end="01:27:50.309" style="s2">engender certain kinds of collapse</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.570" end="01:27:53.070" style="s2">dynamics that seems to be a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.309" end="01:27:58.979" style="s2">thing to say about a potential there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.070" end="01:28:02.190" style="s2">other potentials and to stick with some</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.979" end="01:28:08.999" style="s2">of the themes of this conversation we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.190" end="01:28:12.679" style="s2">spoken about the importance of mindset</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.999" end="01:28:17.070" style="s2">the kind of values enabling of</p>

<p begin="01:28:17.070" end="01:28:24.380" style="s2">growth or at least we haven&#39;t obviously</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.360" end="01:28:24.380" style="s2">talent exhaustively</p>

<p begin="01:28:31.400" end="01:28:42.480" style="s2">mass extinction events we see change all</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.420" end="01:28:44.760" style="s2">around us as is always the case of</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:46.890" style="s2">course is change and of course the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.760" end="01:28:49.440" style="s2">of living and dying is always the case -</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.890" end="01:28:53.300" style="s2">but there seems to be again from a</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.440" end="01:28:56.040" style="s2">certain perspective a sense that somehow</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.300" end="01:28:58.110" style="s2">and we can actually speak to it quite we</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.040" end="01:29:00.270" style="s2">can speak to it quite under ectly from</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.110" end="01:29:03.330" style="s2">certain game theoretic perspective this</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.270" end="01:29:04.650" style="s2">is not that vague actually how some of</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.330" end="01:29:08.720" style="s2">the perspectives we can take to</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.650" end="01:29:11.790" style="s2">characterize our out-of-touch nurse with</p>

<p begin="01:29:11.790" end="01:29:17.430" style="s2">ecological sphere and we might say it</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.360" end="01:29:20.280" style="s2">would be a good thing to come back into</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.430" end="01:29:26.610" style="s2">closer touch with what it is to live</p>

<p begin="01:29:26.610" end="01:29:32.670" style="s2">did not render us so fragile to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.150" end="01:29:34.650" style="s2">collapse of not only all that we care</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.670" end="01:29:36.300" style="s2">about but all that we can apprehend or</p>

<p begin="01:29:36.300" end="01:29:48.450" style="s2">as beautiful so and we also have in this</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.950" end="01:29:53.610" style="s2">conversation as well gotten into some of</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.450" end="01:29:56.070" style="s2">the challenges of speaking about well</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.610" end="01:29:58.230" style="s2">you mentioned this a histological gap of</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.070" end="01:30:00.390" style="s2">how can we know other minds in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.230" end="01:30:05.310" style="s2">sense and an ontological gap in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.390" end="01:30:07.530" style="s2">understanding what the the like getting</p>

<p begin="01:30:14.600" end="01:30:23.670" style="s2">really map on to do something we could</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.990" end="01:30:26.520" style="s2">look at from say more of an objective</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.670" end="01:30:32.520" style="s2">kind of perspective like we can relate</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.520" end="01:30:34.830" style="s2">to it in that way but it&#39;s like so these</p>

<p begin="01:30:51.780" end="01:30:58.469" style="s2">like this a semantic attachment to</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.469" end="01:31:03.810" style="s2">the base of things but you did mention</p>

<p begin="01:31:46.739" end="01:31:51.210" style="s2">the I I do think the language is often</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.440" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s so important and it can also be</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.210" end="01:31:58.020" style="s2">such an unhelpful barrier to really</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:32:02.340" style="s2">doing the but it is a language game I</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.020" end="01:32:04.110" style="s2">love thinking Stein&#39;s language okay</p>

<p begin="01:32:40.500" end="01:32:48.900" style="s2">right so and and you mentioned something</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.060" end="01:32:51.570" style="s2">to do with this in the in the mind one</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.900" end="01:32:53.940" style="s2">system of the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.570" end="01:32:56.790" style="s2">approach that the predator-prey behavior</p>

<p begin="01:32:56.790" end="01:33:01.860" style="s2">and in my language I say confrontation</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.280" end="01:33:03.300" style="s2">and surrender it could be other other</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.860" end="01:33:04.380" style="s2">terms kind of using there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.300" end="01:33:05.880" style="s2">different kinds of computation</p>

<p begin="01:33:11.430" end="01:33:15.840" style="s2">have things like articulated to</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.890" end="01:33:18.480" style="s2">appointment yet where I&#39;m ready to just</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.840" end="01:33:22.700" style="s2">go okay here is the kind of the model or</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.480" end="01:33:28.280" style="s2">the system but this dynamic of of</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.700" end="01:33:31.640" style="s2">of because it being in a kind of right</p>

<p begin="01:33:34.020" end="01:33:39.030" style="s2">and when should you accept ingression or</p>

<p begin="01:33:39.030" end="01:33:42.720" style="s2">is you hold boundaries and because I</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.130" end="01:33:44.280" style="s2">want to link this up with how it is to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.720" end="01:33:46.560" style="s2">come into relationality with each other</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.280" end="01:33:49.140" style="s2">and also the issues with our world hey</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.560" end="01:33:51.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s also this nation this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.140" end="01:33:52.680" style="s2">truth and integrity that you mentioned I</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.180" end="01:33:54.330" style="s2">like those values you mentioned Gregg</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.680" end="01:33:56.490" style="s2">truly are beautiful hey like what is</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.330" end="01:33:57.900" style="s2">this is this is so wonderful dignity</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.490" end="01:34:01.470" style="s2">well-being and integrity as you</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.900" end="01:34:04.170" style="s2">articulate it and it&#39;s like how would</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.470" end="01:34:06.750" style="s2">those kind of values serve us as a</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.170" end="01:34:08.460" style="s2">mapping at this fundamental mind one</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.750" end="01:34:10.140" style="s2">kind of level because if you take the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.460" end="01:34:12.270" style="s2">dignity it&#39;s kind of an it it&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="01:34:12.270" end="01:34:16.560" style="s2">is a dynamic that I&#39;m in relationship to</p>

<p begin="01:34:16.560" end="01:34:19.740" style="s2">the well-being of course okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.360" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">something phenomenological about that</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.740" end="01:34:24.920" style="s2">from our perspective but in a sense from</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:28.260" style="s2">you know a base level it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.920" end="01:34:30.630" style="s2">well maybe it is I just wish to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.260" end="01:34:32.340" style="s2">survive or this is appropriate for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.630" end="01:34:33.360" style="s2">continuation of me or what have you but</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.340" end="01:34:35.430" style="s2">we have to take that so seriously</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.360" end="01:34:37.320" style="s2">because of course if we are out of touch</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.430" end="01:34:38.970" style="s2">if we are out of touch and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.320" end="01:34:40.080" style="s2">thinking well how is it we came to be so</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.970" end="01:34:42.510" style="s2">out of touch but it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.080" end="01:34:44.970" style="s2">something like that kind of rivalry</p>

<p begin="01:35:42.239" end="01:35:48.359" style="s2">okay thank you</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.289" end="01:35:50.239" style="s2">because that&#39;s like yes how do we</p>

<p begin="01:35:50.239" end="01:35:54.329" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of like there&#39;s this meta</p>

<p begin="01:35:54.329" end="01:35:58.649" style="s2">this meta schematic right that actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.159" end="01:36:00.929" style="s2">saw my opinion solve some serious</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.649" end="01:36:03.510" style="s2">long-standing fucking problems okay and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.929" end="01:36:06.209" style="s2">then that&#39;s very different than actually</p>

<p begin="01:41:34.410" end="01:41:39.360" style="s2">off and what you get there is a neuro</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.480" end="01:41:41.190" style="s2">computational system that&#39;s yoking cells</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.360" end="01:41:42.930" style="s2">together so that animals behave this</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.190" end="01:41:43.959" style="s2">whole unit since the new information</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.930" end="01:41:46.119" style="s2">processing system</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.959" end="01:41:49.449" style="s2">and a new computational control and</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.119" end="01:41:52.030" style="s2">communication system and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.449" end="01:41:54.309" style="s2">tree of knowledge calls mind which is a</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.030" end="01:41:57.249" style="s2">word like life it&#39;s just what you see</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.309" end="01:41:59.979" style="s2">animals doing in the language system as</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.249" end="01:42:03.159" style="s2">I go my dog just walked by those mine a</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.979" end="01:42:07.269" style="s2">fish over there in a tank the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.159" end="01:42:08.999" style="s2">of the fish is mental behavior okay just</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.269" end="01:42:12.789" style="s2">like you would see a plan call it alive</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.999" end="01:42:15.760" style="s2">living behavior okay and then finally</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.789" end="01:42:17.380" style="s2">hundred thousand years ago plus or minus</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.760" end="01:42:19.179" style="s2">and certainly by fifty thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.380" end="01:42:21.189" style="s2">ago you have what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.179" end="01:42:23.709" style="s2">that&#39;s language that is yoking</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.189" end="01:42:26.260" style="s2">subjective minds together on a highway</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.709" end="01:42:29.800" style="s2">of information building systems of</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.260" end="01:42:32.050" style="s2">justification okay that coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.800" end="01:42:34.269" style="s2">people first but the hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.050" end="01:42:36.099" style="s2">level and then at the horticultural</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.269" end="01:42:37.479" style="s2">level and then at the agricultural level</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.099" end="01:42:38.920" style="s2">then if the civilization level and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.479" end="01:42:40.689" style="s2">the hill and there&#39;s writing and they</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.920" end="01:42:42.670" style="s2">build all these formal systems and</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.689" end="01:42:45.459" style="s2">ultimately you get philosophy in science</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.670" end="01:42:49.150" style="s2">mathematics okay you get the systems of</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.459" end="01:42:50.559" style="s2">justification alright so if you use the</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.150" end="01:42:53.499" style="s2">tree of knowledge and you say alright</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.559" end="01:42:55.780" style="s2">seriously what has given rise to each of</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.499" end="01:43:02.110" style="s2">these qualitative jumps following matt</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.780" end="01:43:03.939" style="s2">life mine culture life DNA RNA</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.110" end="01:43:06.939" style="s2">information processing coordinated</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.939" end="01:43:10.119" style="s2">system together networked mind and neuro</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.939" end="01:43:13.150" style="s2">information system language symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.119" end="01:43:15.249" style="s2">communication and language justification</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.150" end="01:43:17.469" style="s2">so then the question is well what you</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.249" end="01:43:20.139" style="s2">get is what you if there&#39;s a novel</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.469" end="01:43:22.449" style="s2">information processing system that gets</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.139" end="01:43:24.550" style="s2">yoked together and then communicates</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.449" end="01:43:27.209" style="s2">amongst itself then you would get</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.550" end="01:43:27.209" style="s2">another chunk</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.410" end="01:43:47.040" style="s2">so once you see that it&#39;s an information</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.150" end="01:43:50.780" style="s2">processing system that&#39;s yoked together</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.040" end="01:43:54.420" style="s2">in an Internet at interconnected network</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.780" end="01:43:57.420" style="s2">okay that creates information interface</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.420" end="01:43:58.730" style="s2">and artificial symbiotic human</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.420" end="01:44:01.650" style="s2">intelligence systems</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.730" end="01:44:03.090" style="s2">well shit that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.650" end="01:44:04.650" style="s2">in the 20th century they laid the</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.090" end="01:44:06.660" style="s2">groundwork for all of that and all of</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.650" end="01:44:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna get yoked together in the</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.660" end="01:44:14.580" style="s2">21st century and that&#39;s the digital</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.500" end="01:44:16.890" style="s2">landscape so the digital landscape okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.580" end="01:44:18.960" style="s2">what this conversation is taking place</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.890" end="01:44:21.390" style="s2">which collapses across space and time</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.960" end="01:44:23.220" style="s2">and allows our justification systems to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.390" end="01:44:25.140" style="s2">be yoked together in a radically</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.220" end="01:44:27.110" style="s2">different way that of course 20,000</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.140" end="01:44:30.360" style="s2">years ago is just even just pure magic</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.110" end="01:44:32.070" style="s2">right if we have this kind of inner</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.360" end="01:44:33.750" style="s2">network connection and we have</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.070" end="01:44:36.480" style="s2">artificial intelligence big data</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.750" end="01:44:38.280" style="s2">communication and then we internet the</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.480" end="01:44:39.930" style="s2">Internet of Things connects all of our</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.280" end="01:44:45.840" style="s2">machines together then we start putting</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.930" end="01:44:48.660" style="s2">shit in our heads right you know then</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.840" end="01:44:51.030" style="s2">well welcome exactly welcome to evolve</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.660" end="01:44:53.670" style="s2">our Arika you know homo doiis do so</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.030" end="01:44:56.970" style="s2">whatever you could have but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.670" end="01:44:59.130" style="s2">hello right we are actually sitting the</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.970" end="01:45:00.990" style="s2">Kyros of this moment not only is like</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.130" end="01:45:03.360" style="s2">what&#39;s the global institutional</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.990" end="01:45:06.000" style="s2">infrastructure but it&#39;s also this global</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.360" end="01:45:07.590" style="s2">technological boom that creates an</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.000" end="01:45:09.720" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.590" end="01:45:11.100" style="s2">network system that is radically</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.720" end="01:45:12.510" style="s2">different than anything we did before</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.100" end="01:45:16.140" style="s2">it makes them it makes the printing</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.510" end="01:45:18.860" style="s2">press you know look miniscule relative</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.140" end="01:45:21.210" style="s2">to what we&#39;re so for mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.860" end="01:45:23.070" style="s2">so this is what&#39;s called the on the tree</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.210" end="01:45:25.170" style="s2">of knowledge each one of these jumps is</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.070" end="01:45:26.880" style="s2">a joint point so you go from energy pure</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.170" end="01:45:28.860" style="s2">energy of the Big Bang to matter that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.880" end="01:45:30.600" style="s2">joint point one matter to life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.860" end="01:45:32.490" style="s2">joint point to life to mine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.600" end="01:45:33.450" style="s2">showing point three mind a culture is</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.490" end="01:45:36.240" style="s2">joint point four</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.450" end="01:45:38.850" style="s2">this is joint point five that the 21st</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.240" end="01:45:40.260" style="s2">century is about and it&#39;s unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.850" end="01:45:42.480" style="s2">every one of these joint points is</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.260" end="01:45:44.220" style="s2">really key and they&#39;re complicated and</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.480" end="01:45:47.490" style="s2">they&#39;re vulnerable because you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.220" end="01:45:49.340" style="s2">educate and the dynamics then between</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.490" end="01:45:52.170" style="s2">order and chaos you&#39;re gonna get all</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.340" end="01:45:54.870" style="s2">waxed and I really think that we are</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.170" end="01:45:56.160" style="s2">actually at that point and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.870" end="01:45:57.900" style="s2">miracle of a thing called the</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.160" end="01:45:59.760" style="s2">singularity I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.900" end="01:46:02.640" style="s2">you know tracking this at all but</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.760" end="01:46:05.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing you know called the</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.640" end="01:46:07.740" style="s2">singularity Ray Kurzweil popularized but</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.820" end="01:46:10.650" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a tracking of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.740" end="01:46:12.390" style="s2">evolution of complexity and I can</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.650" end="01:46:14.730" style="s2">explain what I think this means but</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.390" end="01:46:16.350" style="s2">ultimately acrosses as a mathematician a</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.730" end="01:46:19.800" style="s2">Russian mathematician that nailed this</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.350" end="01:46:21.990" style="s2">down from 20 27 to 20 29 who crossed the</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.800" end="01:46:24.390" style="s2">threshold of the singularity okay</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.990" end="01:46:26.760" style="s2">fascinating unbelievable actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.390" end="01:46:28.320" style="s2">imaginable as far as a mystical I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.760" end="01:46:30.510" style="s2">know if you&#39;re familiar with a Roy</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.320" end="01:46:32.870" style="s2">Bhaskar and his later years he developed</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.510" end="01:46:36.390" style="s2">what&#39;s called meta reality he was a</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.870" end="01:46:39.120" style="s2">grounded philosopher and then actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.390" end="01:46:41.040" style="s2">popped into this real spiritual view of</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.120" end="01:46:44.040" style="s2">the universe which which is why I have</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.040" end="01:46:46.860" style="s2">deep respect for pan psychic views and I</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.040" end="01:46:49.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know he&#39;ll who the hell knows is I</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.860" end="01:46:51.450" style="s2">mean maybe the baby God is calling us to</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.170" end="01:46:54.690" style="s2">wake up you know I mean you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.450" end="01:46:57.120" style="s2">agnostic about that but I have seen shit</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.690" end="01:46:59.570" style="s2">and I have my theory connects me to shit</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.120" end="01:47:04.020" style="s2">that I can&#39;t even possibly fathom so I</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.570" end="01:47:05.910" style="s2">that awakens me to a spiritual notion</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.020" end="01:47:09.240" style="s2">I&#39;m Abed I&#39;m agnostic about but that is</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.910" end="01:47:11.010" style="s2">a calling it&#39;s an ultimate concern it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.240" end="01:47:15.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a way in which I place the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.010" end="01:47:16.920" style="s2">of my life yeah so yeah so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.450" end="01:47:21.110" style="s2">frame and then you come back to well</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.920" end="01:47:23.190" style="s2">what you do with that well Tim</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.110" end="01:47:25.050" style="s2">articulated that dilemmas about what</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.190" end="01:47:28.500" style="s2">they actually do brilliantly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.050" end="01:47:30.860" style="s2">know it&#39;s my architecture what do we</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.500" end="01:47:33.750" style="s2">actually do well each of us are journey</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.860" end="01:47:35.790" style="s2">so look yeah it will thank you for that</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.750" end="01:47:40.050" style="s2">that was a beautiful articulation I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.790" end="01:47:47.100" style="s2">I have some ideas about what to do you</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.050" end="01:47:51.810" style="s2">know and it seems to be developed</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.100" end="01:47:54.960" style="s2">cultivate skillfulness or worthiness</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.810" end="01:47:57.270" style="s2">maybe to extend invitations</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.960" end="01:48:02.990" style="s2">to engage in a certain kind of movement</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.270" end="01:48:09.150" style="s2">of understanding yeah there seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.990" end="01:48:13.580" style="s2">it does seem like there are important</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.150" end="01:48:18.570" style="s2">questions that must be transformed and</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.580" end="01:48:20.610" style="s2">that a certain sort of participation in</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.570" end="01:48:26.930" style="s2">with each other in the transformation of</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.610" end="01:48:33.440" style="s2">those questions is an appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.930" end="01:48:33.440" style="s2">grounding or aspiration and in that aim</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.400" end="01:48:38.610" style="s2">now that of course itself is is not</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.080" end="01:48:42.330" style="s2">giving a definitive answer but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.610" end="01:48:46.340" style="s2">opening to a kind of process perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.330" end="01:48:48.450" style="s2">better enabling of coming to terms and</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.340" end="01:48:51.900" style="s2">maybe coming to a certain sort of</p>

<p begin="01:49:11.430" end="01:49:15.240" style="s2">conversations comes an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.650" end="01:49:17.790" style="s2">extend an invitation for another</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.240" end="01:49:20.790" style="s2">conversation which is something I would</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.790" end="01:49:23.040" style="s2">love to do and if not with you you and I</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.790" end="01:49:25.020" style="s2">with some other people as well so see</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.040" end="01:49:26.670" style="s2">how to do this kind of thing with with</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.020" end="01:49:27.930" style="s2">multiple people as is happening in a few</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.670" end="01:49:29.100" style="s2">different places right now but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.930" end="01:49:33.200" style="s2">interested I would love to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.100" end="01:49:37.740" style="s2">again in that kind of way yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.200" end="01:49:41.130" style="s2">I&#39;m just having us here I lead a society</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.740" end="01:49:46.350" style="s2">called theory of knowledge Society and</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.130" end="01:49:49.110" style="s2">on on Monday we you know we were just we</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.350" end="01:49:52.650" style="s2">just yesterday days all blend together</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.110" end="01:49:55.770" style="s2">yeah you know we had a group of almost</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.650" end="01:49:58.860" style="s2">20 of us for almost two hours</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.770" end="01:50:03.780" style="s2">the thought topic was mindfulness okay</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.860" end="01:50:06.270" style="s2">and what that was and what it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.780" end="01:50:07.460" style="s2">unified framework offers an integrative</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.270" end="01:50:09.490" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.460" end="01:50:16.340" style="s2">to psychological mindfulness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.490" end="01:50:18.980" style="s2">capsule in the acronym calm Emma and it</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.340" end="01:50:21.260" style="s2">provides I talked to Sean for Becky a</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.980" end="01:50:24.800" style="s2">little bit about that provides my sort</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.260" end="01:50:27.500" style="s2">of opening frame for psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.800" end="01:50:31.900" style="s2">that would enable processes that would</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.500" end="01:50:34.640" style="s2">be conducive to the dialo goes element</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.900" end="01:50:37.040" style="s2">and those kinds of elements so I love it</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.640" end="01:50:38.810" style="s2">by the way I have I have read into a</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.040" end="01:50:43.340" style="s2">little bit I appreciated it in that</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.810" end="01:50:44.870" style="s2">conversation if you if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.340" end="01:50:46.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t mind giving like I know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.870" end="01:50:49.790" style="s2">bit ridiculous to give like a one-minute</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.640" end="01:50:51.560" style="s2">or two-minute sort of it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.790" end="01:50:53.780" style="s2">designed actually it is designed to be</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.560" end="01:50:55.250" style="s2">very quick okay so first off I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.780" end="01:50:56.510" style="s2">it&#39;s approach to psychological</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.250" end="01:50:58.460" style="s2">mindfulness that&#39;s a little different</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.510" end="01:50:59.930" style="s2">than meditative mindfulness but at the</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.460" end="01:51:01.970" style="s2">word mindfulness that means you want to</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.930" end="01:51:03.620" style="s2">cultivate awareness and acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.970" end="01:51:07.130" style="s2">virtually the thing that mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.620" end="01:51:08.150" style="s2">always as opposed to rejection and blind</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.130" end="01:51:10.070" style="s2">mindlessness</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.150" end="01:51:12.020" style="s2">that&#39;s so mindfulness means you want to</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.070" end="01:51:14.450" style="s2">cultivate awareness and a position of</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.020" end="01:51:15.590" style="s2">acceptance psychological mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.450" end="01:51:16.970" style="s2">that it means that I&#39;m going to come at</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.590" end="01:51:19.130" style="s2">it from a more analytic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.970" end="01:51:21.170" style="s2">rather than meditative mindfulness which</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.130" end="01:51:24.140" style="s2">would be able witnessing mine too</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.170" end="01:51:27.020" style="s2">subjective phenomenological when you</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.140" end="01:51:30.260" style="s2">meditate you train yourself to attend to</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.020" end="01:51:32.840" style="s2">your witnessing function the comment oh</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.260" end="01:51:36.380" style="s2">is train yourself really how to adopt a</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.840" end="01:51:39.050" style="s2">more like an internal therapists view</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.380" end="01:51:42.710" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s not surprising given my</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.050" end="01:51:45.880" style="s2">training all right so really quickly mo</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.710" end="01:51:48.440" style="s2">stands for a metacognitive observer okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.880" end="01:51:50.750" style="s2">which basically means you step outside</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.440" end="01:51:52.390" style="s2">the stream of your action and take an</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.750" end="01:51:55.250" style="s2">observer view from a meta perspective</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.390" end="01:51:58.910" style="s2">okay it also doubles as the term mo</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.250" end="01:52:00.920" style="s2">which is modus operandi and when I say</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.910" end="01:52:03.350" style="s2">that I say that what I&#39;m going to teach</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.920" end="01:52:06.200" style="s2">you is simple</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.350" end="01:52:08.420" style="s2">at one level but very hard to do okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.200" end="01:52:09.890" style="s2">and then the analogy I often use is like</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.420" end="01:52:11.240" style="s2">well if I told you that basketball is</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.890" end="01:52:14.150" style="s2">about taking a ball and flipping in a</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.240" end="01:52:15.230" style="s2">hoop that might sound kind of easy but I</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.150" end="01:52:16.070" style="s2">could talk to you for three minutes</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.230" end="01:52:18.110" style="s2">about basketball</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.070" end="01:52:20.239" style="s2">you have no idea okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.110" end="01:52:21.619" style="s2">I say that in terms of you know I can</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.239" end="01:52:23.750" style="s2">give you a frame but actually six</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.619" end="01:52:26.750" style="s2">practice and so really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.750" end="01:52:28.369" style="s2">psychological skill set so metacognitive</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.750" end="01:52:31.850" style="s2">observer and modus operandi they</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.369" end="01:52:34.580" style="s2">cultivate okay and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.850" end="01:52:36.530" style="s2">perspective that on yourself and on</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.580" end="01:52:39.560" style="s2">others that is a participant observer</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.530" end="01:52:41.810" style="s2">and then calm so the first thing you do</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.560" end="01:52:45.230" style="s2">is you say the word and you invite your</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.810" end="01:52:46.820" style="s2">body to be calm okay and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.230" end="01:52:48.350" style="s2">gonna invite your mind and ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.820" end="01:52:51.260" style="s2">your spirit which is your ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.350" end="01:52:53.210" style="s2">concern to be calm and we can call that</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.260" end="01:52:54.920" style="s2">from John 4:18 we call it a vertical</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.210" end="01:52:57.110" style="s2">move since that I want to get into my</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.920" end="01:52:58.790" style="s2">body into my effect into my higher</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.110" end="01:53:01.790" style="s2">cognition ultimately my spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.790" end="01:53:04.550" style="s2">concern and kama courses you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.790" end="01:53:07.969" style="s2">position then against the anxious</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.550" end="01:53:09.409" style="s2">defensive threatened view and if you</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.969" end="01:53:10.790" style="s2">know things about like polyvagal nerve</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.409" end="01:53:12.940" style="s2">there you&#39;ll know that basically what</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.790" end="01:53:18.350" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do is try to get that open</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.940" end="01:53:21.340" style="s2">system of participation okay so calm</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.350" end="01:53:23.659" style="s2">body calm minecon spirits first thing</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.340" end="01:53:26.420" style="s2">then the second thing is that calm</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.659" end="01:53:28.219" style="s2">stands for an acronym okay it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.420" end="01:53:30.619" style="s2">acronym it&#39;s not just the word it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.219" end="01:53:34.219" style="s2">acronym that cultivates the attitude</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.619" end="01:53:34.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to in a an act an</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.219" end="01:53:37.389" style="s2">engender</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.940" end="01:53:42.580" style="s2">of intra psychically and interpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.389" end="01:53:45.760" style="s2">and whether the C stands for curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.580" end="01:53:48.619" style="s2">so now I want to create a mindset of</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.760" end="01:53:52.760" style="s2">curiosity and openness as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.619" end="01:53:55.489" style="s2">closeness and criticality and I should</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.760" end="01:53:57.920" style="s2">say by the way the originator of an</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.489" end="01:53:59.780" style="s2">element of this was Dan Siegel he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.920" end="01:54:04.280" style="s2">interpersonal neurobiology so I really</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.780" end="01:54:06.170" style="s2">like and he had coal and I&#39;m bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.280" end="01:54:10.310" style="s2">in but I&#39;d like to make sure he gets</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.170" end="01:54:14.000" style="s2">credit anyway so curiosity the second</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.310" end="01:54:15.920" style="s2">word is as for acceptance and this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.000" end="01:54:18.500" style="s2">what the Buddha taught us in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.920" end="01:54:23.270" style="s2">really the capacity to be and be present</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.500" end="01:54:25.760" style="s2">okay to detach from your emotions in</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.270" end="01:54:27.560" style="s2">terms of I need to feel this way know</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.760" end="01:54:30.650" style="s2">you are feeling this way and you have</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.560" end="01:54:33.000" style="s2">the capacity for radical acceptance be</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.650" end="01:54:34.530" style="s2">acceptance of self acceptance of past</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.000" end="01:54:38.130" style="s2">acceptance of the way the world is</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.530" end="01:54:40.679" style="s2">acceptance of other not in a do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.130" end="01:54:42.659" style="s2">you want sir away but just a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.679" end="01:54:44.699" style="s2">not resist okay</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.659" end="01:54:46.830" style="s2">suffering in Buddhism is a combination</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.699" end="01:54:48.679" style="s2">of pain and then resistance acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.830" end="01:54:50.369" style="s2">is the inverse of resistance</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.679" end="01:54:52.260" style="s2">psychologically we often talk about is</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.369" end="01:54:55.590" style="s2">to stress tolerance and service skills</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.260" end="01:54:57.510" style="s2">from the way so acceptance acceptance of</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.590" end="01:55:00.690" style="s2">feelings acceptance past expectance of</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.510" end="01:55:04.350" style="s2">self acceptance of other the L stands</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.690" end="01:55:05.969" style="s2">for loving compassion loving compassion</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.350" end="01:55:07.770" style="s2">is the fundamental attitude we gets back</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.969" end="01:55:10.199" style="s2">to dignity where every individual has</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.770" end="01:55:12.750" style="s2">dignity we want to cultivate that in my</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.199" end="01:55:15.150" style="s2">self compassion cultivates the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.750" end="01:55:16.500" style="s2">I hope for wellbeing for you and your</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.150" end="01:55:20.100" style="s2">loved ones I hope for wellbeing for</p>

<p begin="01:55:23.960" end="01:55:30.030" style="s2">and finally motivated refers to</p>

<p begin="01:55:53.659" end="01:56:00.030" style="s2">through the end of my life and my eulogy</p>

<p begin="01:56:10.889" end="01:56:17.010" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the calm mo mindset is</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.770" end="01:56:18.780" style="s2">about and and the argument fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.010" end="01:56:21.960" style="s2">is we create a culture of that</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.780" end="01:56:23.610" style="s2">individuals extend calm mo to ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.960" end="01:56:25.940" style="s2">and others and you do the same to me</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.610" end="01:56:27.960" style="s2">that&#39;s creates a very very different</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.940" end="01:56:30.869" style="s2">ecology on talk about ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.960" end="01:56:33.600" style="s2">practices it&#39;s an ecology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.869" end="01:56:36.330" style="s2">relational and intrapsychic ecology that</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.600" end="01:56:38.100" style="s2">enables you really what it&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.330" end="01:56:40.290" style="s2">of course how do you deal with conflict</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.100" end="01:56:41.550" style="s2">how do you deal with you know intense</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.290" end="01:56:44.130" style="s2">disagreement how do you deal with your</p>

<p begin="01:56:44.130" end="01:56:49.800" style="s2">actually serves as a balm you know calm</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.889" end="01:56:52.469" style="s2">balm in British so the maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.800" end="01:56:55.320" style="s2">processes that are so often engender get</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.469" end="01:56:57.090" style="s2">actually are brought to bear and then</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.320" end="01:56:58.710" style="s2">they&#39;re reversed and this is what my</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.090" end="01:57:00.599" style="s2">training as a psychotherapist really</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.710" end="01:57:03.599" style="s2">taught me it&#39;s like it cut encapsulates</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.599" end="01:57:06.300" style="s2">all the processes and principles that we</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.599" end="01:57:08.070" style="s2">identify and reverse maladaptive cycles</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.300" end="01:57:11.449" style="s2">inter psychically near personally and</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.070" end="01:57:14.280" style="s2">then it creates the kind of fertile</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.449" end="01:57:19.070" style="s2">context so that we can grow adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.280" end="01:57:19.070" style="s2">relational and inter psychic modes</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.219" end="01:57:25.889" style="s2">beautiful thank you so much for that I</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.480" end="01:57:27.630" style="s2">think it&#39;s um a very smart and elegant</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.889" end="01:57:35.159" style="s2">inclusion of so many important things</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.630" end="01:57:40.560" style="s2">that I am yeah I&#39;m in no doubt of their</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.159" end="01:57:48.389" style="s2">of their help if we can if we can enter</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.560" end="01:57:51.060" style="s2">into this disposition yeah I know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.389" end="01:57:53.610" style="s2">just my friend who&#39;s a sociologist I</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.060" end="01:57:55.920" style="s2">taught him this calm mo he as a good</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.610" end="01:57:57.270" style="s2">gesture he&#39;s a professor but as a good</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.920" end="01:58:00.000" style="s2">gesture on weekends trying to help</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.270" end="01:58:02.099" style="s2">people um he has a truck and he started</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.000" end="01:58:04.230" style="s2">renting it out to people in need to help</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.099" end="01:58:06.300" style="s2">them move okay so he was telling her</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.230" end="01:58:08.040" style="s2">fruit that he had learned calm mo last</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.300" end="01:58:09.000" style="s2">year-and-a-half from me because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.040" end="01:58:10.469" style="s2">friend of mine and he really</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.000" end="01:58:12.030" style="s2">internalized it but he learned it as a</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.469" end="01:58:13.889" style="s2">sociologist he don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.030" end="01:58:15.420" style="s2">sort of the depth of clinical</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.889" end="01:58:17.610" style="s2">functioning but he&#39;s taught himself he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.420" end="01:58:19.619" style="s2">taught it to his kids and he&#39;s any you</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.610" end="01:58:21.570" style="s2">know so he gets up to somebody and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.619" end="01:58:23.040" style="s2">working with you know because he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.570" end="01:58:24.869" style="s2">this basically as a charity he&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.040" end="01:58:27.690" style="s2">with some really brutalized people okay</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.869" end="01:58:30.690" style="s2">so he rides up and he&#39;s you know for 10</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.690" end="01:58:32.610" style="s2">bucks he&#39;s moving and I spend in half</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.690" end="01:58:35.130" style="s2">his day for ten dollars basically Jerry</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.610" end="01:58:36.719" style="s2">got something he&#39;s like this truck sucks</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.130" end="01:58:39.020" style="s2">you know what did you break this truck</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.719" end="01:58:42.869" style="s2">for I thought you had a decent truck so</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.020" end="01:58:44.760" style="s2">so Joe was basically like hey in his old</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.869" end="01:58:47.250" style="s2">days he would have said fuck you you</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.760" end="01:58:49.860" style="s2">know yeah being kind and you&#39;re being an</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.250" end="01:58:51.449" style="s2">asshole and I&#39;m driving off so that</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.860" end="01:58:52.830" style="s2">activated and then he would have</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.449" end="01:58:54.250" style="s2">ruminated about it and would have been</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.830" end="01:58:57.010" style="s2">all pissed</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.250" end="01:58:58.960" style="s2">I know so instead what he did is he</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.010" end="01:59:02.800" style="s2">immediately triggered calming himself</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.960" end="01:59:04.780" style="s2">and was like huh okay yes I see the mist</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.800" end="01:59:06.910" style="s2">that makes sense what do I really want</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.780" end="01:59:08.320" style="s2">to do and then he was like well I wonder</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.910" end="01:59:11.980" style="s2">why this guy is pissed</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.320" end="01:59:13.840" style="s2">no well shit if I were moving and I was</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.980" end="01:59:15.820" style="s2">stressed and I was moving into a crack</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.840" end="01:59:19.120" style="s2">house from a crack house I&#39;d probably be</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.820" end="01:59:22.090" style="s2">pretty pissed off too right you be and</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.120" end="01:59:24.340" style="s2">so he actually did an emotional jujitsu</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.090" end="01:59:25.690" style="s2">and basically say hey I see it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.340" end="01:59:27.100" style="s2">kind of drug you want to try it anyway</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.690" end="01:59:29.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s probably better than</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.100" end="01:59:31.780" style="s2">nothing but it&#39;s totally up to you dude</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.640" end="01:59:34.480" style="s2">so in other words he basically just</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.780" end="01:59:36.970" style="s2">absorbed the hit and then decided I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.480" end="01:59:39.520" style="s2">give you you know an olive branch even</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.970" end="01:59:42.220" style="s2">so and like very quickly the guy then</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.520" end="01:59:43.690" style="s2">went from hot to neutral and over the</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.220" end="01:59:45.520" style="s2">course of the day went from very</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.690" end="01:59:47.680" style="s2">appreciative and then banked a guy and</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.520" end="01:59:51.250" style="s2">it worked out fine yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.680" end="01:59:52.900" style="s2">and so that&#39;s just an everyday example</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.250" end="01:59:54.640" style="s2">of somebody who you know not a</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.900" end="01:59:56.710" style="s2">psychologist but just learning to flip</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.640" end="02:00:00.040" style="s2">the calm switch quickly when he got</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.710" end="02:00:02.470" style="s2">bumped by you know an aggressive and</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.040" end="02:00:04.960" style="s2">totally unfair you know kind of attack</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.470" end="02:00:09.610" style="s2">and reminded me of your comment cuz like</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.960" end="02:00:11.500" style="s2">well maybe you should write and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.610" end="02:00:14.140" style="s2">welcome to our dilemma you know when</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.500" end="02:00:15.670" style="s2">when we expend the olive branch how when</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.140" end="02:00:17.530" style="s2">do we not get taken advantage of I mean</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.670" end="02:00:19.630" style="s2">what if the guys I mean these are all</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.530" end="02:00:21.280" style="s2">you know that&#39;s why I see great</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.630" end="02:00:22.510" style="s2">questions I don&#39;t know the answers to</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.280" end="02:00:25.540" style="s2">but there are principles and processes</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.510" end="02:00:30.220" style="s2">that might enable us to increase the</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.540" end="02:00:32.650" style="s2">likelihood yeah well this is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.220" end="02:00:34.600" style="s2">place then to sort of give a nod to a</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.650" end="02:00:37.360" style="s2">conversation we might have in the future</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.600" end="02:00:39.040" style="s2">certainly there&#39;s more to be said if we</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.360" end="02:00:40.390" style="s2">were talking for 10 hours I do think</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.040" end="02:00:41.920" style="s2">there are some other places we could go</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.390" end="02:00:44.080" style="s2">so I&#39;m excited about that and I would</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.920" end="02:00:46.750" style="s2">just leave you with one parting image if</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.080" end="02:00:49.420" style="s2">I might because it just kept recurring</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.750" end="02:00:53.680" style="s2">to me over the last 20 minutes of you of</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.420" end="02:00:58.030" style="s2">you speaking and sort of a a gesture</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.680" end="02:01:00.970" style="s2">towards that the unknown Ness of our</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.030" end="02:01:04.870" style="s2">moment and the nature of all of this and</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.970" end="02:01:08.230" style="s2">it&#39;s what was coming to me was</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.870" end="02:01:11.800" style="s2">the process of the breath hey and this</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.230" end="02:01:14.710" style="s2">notion of well if we were to just if our</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.800" end="02:01:16.480" style="s2">experience of duration was so radically</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.710" end="02:01:18.460" style="s2">changed maybe from the perspective of a</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.480" end="02:01:21.070" style="s2">fly you know just you know without being</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.460" end="02:01:22.960" style="s2">too technical you move in your hand you</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.070" end="02:01:24.250" style="s2">know and that fly sees it like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.960" end="02:01:27.610" style="s2">the slowest thing in the world just</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.250" end="02:01:30.250" style="s2">lazily moves out the way it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.610" end="02:01:32.680" style="s2">universe or our moment or civilization</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.250" end="02:01:34.690" style="s2">as a breath and so far we&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.680" end="02:01:36.640" style="s2">drawing in and we think we can keep</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.690" end="02:01:38.950" style="s2">drawing in or breathing out forever but</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.640" end="02:01:41.110" style="s2">the breath only makes sense given the</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.950" end="02:01:44.440" style="s2">relationship between both expansion and</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.110" end="02:01:46.150" style="s2">contraction and at that moment of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.440" end="02:01:49.930" style="s2">shift and so it&#39;s making sense from both</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.150" end="02:01:53.260" style="s2">sides hey it&#39;s like the the desire to</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.930" end="02:01:54.780" style="s2">breathe in but then also that only makes</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.260" end="02:01:57.640" style="s2">sense if there is also this</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.780" end="02:01:59.470" style="s2">countervailing movement of moving but</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.640" end="02:02:01.360" style="s2">moving the other way and so that</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.470" end="02:02:03.760" style="s2">dialogical relationship then between</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.360" end="02:02:05.530" style="s2">expansion and contraction and the nod to</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.760" end="02:02:08.770" style="s2">the continuity of all of this and so</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.530" end="02:02:10.600" style="s2">much more to come yeah I&#39;m just very</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.770" end="02:02:12.490" style="s2">grateful very grateful for your time and</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.600" end="02:02:13.900" style="s2">therefore for reaching out and and for</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.490" end="02:02:16.480" style="s2">us having this conversation I really</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.900" end="02:02:18.790" style="s2">look forward to some more me too that</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.480" end="02:02:21.210" style="s2">looks beautiful Tim actually touch me I</p>
