<p begin="00:00:06.200" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">Jordan Peterson has become hugely</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.940" end="00:00:13.290" style="s2">successful what do you make of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:18.170" style="s2">phenomena why do you think he&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.290" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">so successful now there is a drought of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.170" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">authenticity and courage and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">has found that hunger and he&#39;s tapped</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">into it and I&#39;m I admire his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">detect it and to speak to it plainly in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">a way that it resonates with I did we</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">were on a panel together in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">and I watched his talk and he described</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">his own surprise at how effective his</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">message had been and he basically said</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">that if he had outlined his message as</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">the core of a business model that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">would have looked laughable to him and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:10.310" style="s2">that he was as shocked as anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">people are resonating with it but when</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.310" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">when you live in a world that is as full</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">of crap as the world we live in where</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">people are advertising to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">from the moment you get up to the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">you go to sleep and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">finally tells you some truth that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">need to hear it&#39;s a relief it&#39;s a relief</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:33.110" style="s2">just to know that there&#39;s some channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">that isn&#39;t compromised by nonsense and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.110" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">he I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">speaking truthfully but I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">speaking from the heart</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">and people know it I think that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">grasps directly the fact that human</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">beings can only actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">the world by virtue of communication</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">with other human beings and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">about the notion of admixture that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">must have a mixture of of love I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">uses the mythopoetic to make sense the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">order order and chaos the way or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">Daoist way is the alchemical admixture</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">of order and chaos and that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how you do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:20.990" style="s2">you biased towards orderliness you find</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:24.410" style="s2">yourself in a rigid non-adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.990" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">non creative non exploratory framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.410" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">which will die because the world changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">if you bias towards chaos you you eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">your young and evaporate which also</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">theis for obvious reasons and the key is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">to actually enable these things to be in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.860" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">relationship with each other and vital</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">healthy relationship with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.330" style="s2">I think that&#39;s in some sense the essence</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">of what he&#39;s focusing on and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.330" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">the core what he&#39;s acting about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:51.710" style="s2">very easy to work with as his voice is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:55.190" style="s2">an instrument because he speaks very</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.710" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">deliberately and sonorous ly and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.190" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">rhythmically anyway he actually speaks</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">in in a kind of form of rhythmic poetry</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">sometimes he is actually rapid</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.530" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s words plus low Phi hip-hop</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">equals jbp way</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.920" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2">at first it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a novelty</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:19.430" style="s2">thing and then I kind of listen to him</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:21.230" style="s2">is like no it&#39;s not a novelty thing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.430" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">is actually really good yeah that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.230" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">that&#39;s been the reaction all over I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:28.250" style="s2">think that was Peterson&#39;s reaction he</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">was instantly like thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:32.630" style="s2">gonna be silly and was amusing it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">like oh this is actually awful and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.630" end="00:03:44.240" style="s2">were now essentially proving useful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">that&#39;s generally interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.240" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">say as well that Peterson has a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">musical or a very performative aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">his speech because he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:58.430" style="s2">performing that performance or aligning</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.420" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">yourself with the truth and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">aligning yourself with the logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:05.209" style="s2">creative principle you would expect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">be for that to have an effect on your</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.209" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">actual performance but he feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">very embodied speaker when he&#39;s onstage</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">like he&#39;s fully inhabiting the stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:17.720" style="s2">that he&#39;s that he&#39;s telling and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">that performative aspect of it is seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.720" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">to me at least also related to what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:22.250" style="s2">talking about the logo of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.380" style="s2">incarnated more in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.250" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">incarnate and more in your in your being</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.380" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">yes and watching him become that over</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">the years because he was not always as</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">as confident and able to just now you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">know you free stars right</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">he&#39;s his whole career yes all careers</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">really reminded me of it&#39;s very $0.50</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">for example got big off the back of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">drama there was created drama you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:55.160" style="s2">beefs with other rappers and being shot</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.020" style="s2">13 times and all this stuff which draws</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.160" end="00:04:59.210" style="s2">people into the story but then he had</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:02.300" style="s2">this huge body of work and that kept</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.210" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">people there Peterson did this Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.300" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">had these public dramas and that brought</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">people to him but then when they got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.410" end="00:05:10.250" style="s2">him they there was this huge body of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:12.680" style="s2">work for them to get sort of lost and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.250" end="00:05:14.390" style="s2">immersed in it Peterson has some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:15.590" style="s2">drama like every week at this point he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.390" end="00:05:17.450" style="s2">like the ultimate sort of contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.590" end="00:05:19.130" style="s2">battle rapper he&#39;s at war with all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.450" end="00:05:20.630" style="s2">of people at all times and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.130" end="00:05:22.010" style="s2">brilliant very interesting and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.630" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">inside you know if you&#39;re a rap fan or</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:34.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a new sort of supervillain to</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.100" end="00:05:40.130" style="s2">entertaining but then he pulls you in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.389" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">and then there&#39;s all this meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.130" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">this huge body of work</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:58.180" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">but he&#39;s quite new on this light if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.180" end="00:06:03.730" style="s2">watch him like 15 years ago it was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:05.850" style="s2">awkward and sort of he was very charming</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.730" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">and he knew what he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.850" end="00:06:11.410" style="s2">but the absolute beast that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">has become as a performance creature who</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.410" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">can now just rock up at an amphitheater</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:17.650" style="s2">and just like freestyle the new to our</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:19.660" style="s2">lecture off the top of his head and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.650" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">very into not repeating himself too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.660" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">in his lake you go see a standard</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">comedian you&#39;ll see pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">set every week for like a year or</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:30.250" style="s2">something right he won&#39;t do that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:31.990" style="s2">more like a very good DJ you know he has</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">all these yes like a fistful of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.990" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">that you know his works together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:36.100" style="s2">they&#39;re linked and he can take on these</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.600" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">different journeys but depending on</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.100" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">who&#39;s in the room and where he is he</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">will create a new and transformative</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">always experience I remember discovering</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:50.920" style="s2">immediately thinking this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:53.530" style="s2">that is needed right now this is about</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.920" end="00:06:55.030" style="s2">the reinterment of the world the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.530" end="00:06:57.400" style="s2">assimilation of spirituality the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.030" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">assimilation of religion this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.400" end="00:07:01.210" style="s2">the thing and I was kind of obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:05.080" style="s2">like digesting listening to all of his</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.210" end="00:07:06.220" style="s2">stuff and then pitched an interview to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.080" end="00:07:08.020" style="s2">him and was lucky enough to get an</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.220" end="00:07:10.780" style="s2">interview with him in October that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.020" end="00:07:13.900" style="s2">then put out as the truth in the time of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.780" end="00:07:16.950" style="s2">chaos documentary in in January at</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.900" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">exactly the time that ironically he then</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.950" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">kind of shot to fame with an interview</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">with my ex colleague Kathy Newman on</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:27.670" style="s2">Channel 4 News</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.540" end="00:07:29.920" style="s2">when a lot of what I had gone to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.670" end="00:07:33.790" style="s2">Jordan Peterson about was synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.920" end="00:07:34.900" style="s2">and it was just uncanny that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.790" end="00:07:36.670" style="s2">synchronicity stopped that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.900" end="00:07:38.590" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s when things start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.670" end="00:07:41.140" style="s2">line up yeah and the more you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.590" end="00:07:44.200" style="s2">space the more they line up yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.140" end="00:07:46.750" style="s2">the question is if you&#39;re like really in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.200" end="00:07:48.820" style="s2">that space how much do things line up</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.750" end="00:07:50.740" style="s2">all of this was happening and I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:53.350" style="s2">wondered what I was gonna make what to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.740" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">make of this and for quite a while I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.350" end="00:07:57.940" style="s2">thinking well I have this kind of link</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:59.410" style="s2">to to Kathy and I have some kind of link</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.940" end="00:08:00.880" style="s2">to Jordan so what I need to do is the a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.410" end="00:08:02.950" style="s2">is between them and get them to go and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.880" end="00:08:04.389" style="s2">do the second interview that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.950" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">was necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.389" end="00:08:08.349" style="s2">so for a while I was doing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:12.069" style="s2">trying to do stuff behind the scenes and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.349" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">then it was clear that Kathy wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.069" end="00:08:14.139" style="s2">interested Channel four weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.389" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.139" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">so Channel four News sorry weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">interested so in the end I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:23.379" style="s2">I came and then it came to me okay I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:26.259" style="s2">should make a documentary glitching the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.379" end="00:08:28.060" style="s2">matrix which then was a way of like just</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.259" end="00:08:30.129" style="s2">downloading all the stuff that I&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.060" end="00:08:31.509" style="s2">thinking about for quite a while and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.129" end="00:08:33.729" style="s2">Clea specially since the election of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.509" end="00:08:36.459" style="s2">Trump about kind of the shadow side of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.729" end="00:08:37.959" style="s2">liberalism and all of the the blind</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.459" end="00:08:39.969" style="s2">spots of liberalism so glitching the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.959" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">matrix was kind of the title of it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.969" end="00:08:47.230" style="s2">it all it was it came from a very from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">real flow state of like being really</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.230" end="00:08:50.110" style="s2">aligned and feeling like okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.089" style="s2">what I&#39;m meant to be doing which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.110" end="00:08:53.380" style="s2">essence of kind of synchronicity and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.089" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">essence of Jordin Peterson&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.380" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">meaning is you know when you&#39;re aligned</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:09:00.940" style="s2">at the right place and then your sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:04.649" style="s2">of meaning tells you what to do and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.940" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">think he&#39;s often misconstrued by people</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.649" end="00:09:10.269" style="s2">who can&#39;t get past the politics or have</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:14.019" style="s2">a reactivity to him but to me he is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.269" end="00:09:16.449" style="s2">doing nothing less than channeling and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.019" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">fully articulating the deep story of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.449" end="00:09:21.730" style="s2">Western culture for the first time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:23.380" style="s2">well certainly for the first time in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.730" end="00:09:26.019" style="s2">internet age you could argue that Young</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.380" end="00:09:28.390" style="s2">was doing the same thing back in the in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.019" end="00:09:30.010" style="s2">the 50s and that there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.390" end="00:09:32.740" style="s2">come along and do this at times in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.010" end="00:09:35.410" style="s2">past but effectively saying we already</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.740" end="00:09:37.510" style="s2">know a lot of the answers we already</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">know the way to live it&#39;s embodied</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.510" end="00:09:42.670" style="s2">interaction that&#39;s embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">mythologies embodied in our religions</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.670" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">it&#39;s embodied and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:48.370" style="s2">look at this piece of art what is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">saying we represented it in art we</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.370" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">represented it in all these ways and now</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:55.810" style="s2">we can fully articulate it tie into</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:10:02.380" style="s2">neuroscience tie into and that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.810" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">it&#39;s an epic epic project and so I get</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.380" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">accused and it&#39;s very easy to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:05.649" style="s2">say well you&#39;re obsessed with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:08.579" style="s2">Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.649" end="00:10:11.019" style="s2">you&#39;re a fanboy and all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.579" end="00:10:13.810" style="s2">but for me the message that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.019" end="00:10:17.020" style="s2">bringing forward is that deep it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.810" end="00:10:20.130" style="s2">deep and therefore I want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.020" end="00:10:23.170" style="s2">continue to use his thought as a lens to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.130" end="00:10:25.000" style="s2">link into other great thinkers like we</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.170" end="00:10:26.950" style="s2">just put out an interview with Rupert</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.000" end="00:10:28.600" style="s2">Sheldrake who I think is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.950" end="00:10:32.260" style="s2">rebellious thinking he&#39;s been doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.600" end="00:10:34.270" style="s2">stuff for a long time and I want to also</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.260" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">continue to kind of expand that into</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.270" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">other into other thinkers make the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:41.710" style="s2">conscious link to to this sort of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">worldview and help yeah just bring out</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.710" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">great bring out great content really</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">where it where is his insight coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:50.500" style="s2">from and so we talking to you when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:51.790" style="s2">were describing hey you almost sound a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.500" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">little bit like Jordan pieces I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.790" end="00:10:58.810" style="s2">the sense of yeah I mean if I had to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">describe my worldview in a nutshell it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.810" end="00:11:07.030" style="s2">would be sort of a Neoplatonic so there</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:10.540" style="s2">was a Neoplatonic stoic mystic Christic</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.030" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">gnostic so the idea of Neoplatonic i</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.540" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">believe i have always just sort of felt</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">like there is a realm of ideal forms</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">stoic do the suck it up fat kid and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:22.270" style="s2">the hard thing 100% Gnostic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:24.760" style="s2">certain ineffable experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.270" end="00:11:27.370" style="s2">and then the mystic Christic is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.760" end="00:11:30.130" style="s2">some reflection on the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.370" end="00:11:31.300" style="s2">Western tradition but nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.130" end="00:11:33.220" style="s2">2,000 years of bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.300" end="00:11:37.000" style="s2">administration and everything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.220" end="00:11:38.710" style="s2">what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.000" end="00:11:40.950" style="s2">and Chronos the intersection of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.710" end="00:11:43.900" style="s2">sacred and profane time in human form so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.950" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">in that respects yeah I would track with</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.900" end="00:11:52.810" style="s2">with Peterson my sense is for me my you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">know gnosis or understanding has come</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.810" end="00:11:59.710" style="s2">from ecstasy&#39;s has come from peak</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:01.180" style="s2">experiences and my sense for him at</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.710" end="00:12:03.370" style="s2">least as he shares what he does of his</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.180" end="00:12:04.830" style="s2">life has come from catharsis has come</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.370" end="00:12:06.940" style="s2">from the suffering it&#39;s come from</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.830" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">battling depressions come from staring</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.940" end="00:12:11.500" style="s2">the abyss in the face versus the view</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.510" style="s2">from the summit and those are ideally</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.500" end="00:12:15.370" style="s2">come full circle and reinforce each</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.510" end="00:12:18.460" style="s2">other but if I had to sort of delineate</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.370" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">maybe where&#39;s his transmission anchoring</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">from it&#39;s maybe a little bit more the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:26.080" style="s2">staring the abyss and and and surviving</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:27.490" style="s2">it then then calling out coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.080" end="00:12:29.240" style="s2">from the mountaintop</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.490" end="00:12:32.440" style="s2">the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.240" end="00:12:36.709" style="s2">from me quite apart from his work with</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.440" end="00:12:39.500" style="s2">these stories modernist was as you say</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.709" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">his investigation into the Bible and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.500" end="00:12:44.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been fascinated although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:47.180" style="s2">an atheist I&#39;m always been fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.300" end="00:12:50.410" style="s2">the power of the biblical stories I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.180" end="00:12:53.089" style="s2">often found myself looking at these huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.410" end="00:12:56.600" style="s2">cathedrals and churches that sprouted up</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.089" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">all over Europe you know and and ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.600" end="00:13:01.820" style="s2">myself well what&#39;s that about you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:03.560" style="s2">why was this story so powerful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.820" end="00:13:05.480" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a defense against death if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.560" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">want to be cynical but hey you know it</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.480" end="00:13:09.649" style="s2">could be lots of other stories you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.860" end="00:13:11.540" style="s2">why is this one so unbelievably powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.649" end="00:13:14.029" style="s2">and what does it mean for it to be so</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.540" end="00:13:15.740" style="s2">powerful and pieces I think brilliantly</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.339" end="00:15:22.309" style="s2">more controversial and I&#39;ve kind of felt</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.910" end="00:15:35.800" style="s2">started arguing with you or judging what</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:06.819" style="s2">me they know I&#39;m not a bigot they know</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.360" end="00:16:10.519" style="s2">they know where I was raised</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.519" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">they know me by my actions so what to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.490" end="00:16:22.189" style="s2">with this I&#39;ve given Jordan Peterson in</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:23.540" style="s2">a sense a year of my life what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.189" end="00:16:25.429" style="s2">with that well they don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:28.999" style="s2">do with that so they&#39;re quiet and they</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.329" end="00:16:42.379" style="s2">what he was saying but also the ripples</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.279" end="00:16:46.579" style="s2">he was having a culture the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.379" end="00:16:48.170" style="s2">phenomenon and explosion of attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.579" end="00:16:51.589" style="s2">that was happening around him in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.170" end="00:16:53.179" style="s2">media and started kind of watching him</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.589" end="00:16:54.559" style="s2">reading him with an open mind my</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.179" end="00:16:55.740" style="s2">experience was an open mind like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.559" end="00:16:57.330" style="s2">resonate with that I love</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:02.820" style="s2">his thinking like how he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.530" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">kicking the left a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.820" end="00:17:08.010" style="s2">calling them on some of their</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:10.560" style="s2">problematic thinking and then watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.010" end="00:17:12.690" style="s2">this kind of phenomenon from the left or</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.560" end="00:17:17.040" style="s2">the far left where people just with</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.690" end="00:17:21.900" style="s2">extraordinary levels of anger and fear</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.040" end="00:17:24.090" style="s2">and distrust and kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.900" end="00:17:26.460" style="s2">difference in that experience of my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.090" end="00:17:28.710" style="s2">and some of our experiences of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.460" end="00:17:29.640" style="s2">and then watching a lot of friends who</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.710" end="00:17:32.130" style="s2">are on the far left</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.640" end="00:17:33.660" style="s2">having radically different experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.130" end="00:17:35.580" style="s2">and perception of who he is and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.660" end="00:17:38.310" style="s2">he&#39;s bringing and was really just</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.580" end="00:17:40.140" style="s2">curious about that and it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.310" end="00:17:43.980" style="s2">similar to some of the stuff you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.140" end="00:17:46.170" style="s2">doing with rebel wisdom and as a I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.980" end="00:17:48.060" style="s2">you&#39;re training as a psychologist we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.170" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">a lot of work with with psychology as</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.240" end="00:17:54.390" style="s2">interesting going on behind it and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.680" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">sort of makes you inquire it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.390" end="00:17:58.980" style="s2">what is what are people reacting to yes</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.680" end="00:18:37.590" style="s2">like Peterson who are trying to carve</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.590" end="00:18:41.430" style="s2">kind of a position that&#39;s lateral to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.690" end="00:18:43.620" style="s2">politics that&#39;s more in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.430" end="00:18:45.660" style="s2">psychological domain to ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.620" end="00:18:47.100" style="s2">look at themselves as individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.660" end="00:18:48.660" style="s2">question the extent to which they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.660" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">which until we can resolve issues on</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:55.020" style="s2">that level it&#39;s going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:57.000" style="s2">difficult to resolve these political</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:18:58.800" style="s2">disagreements and so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.000" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">main reasons that I&#39;ve found myself so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.800" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">interested in what Peterson is saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.830" style="s2">he&#39;s shifting the level of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.710" end="00:19:25.370" style="s2">had particularly part in that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:28.370" style="s2">culture war that is in right precedence</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.370" end="00:19:31.940" style="s2">I mean we are in the middle of a culture</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.940" end="00:19:36.980" style="s2">Peterson is standing in the middle as a</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.220" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">to the promised land it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.750" end="00:20:04.850" style="s2">problematic it leads us into a swamp</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.110" end="00:20:07.880" style="s2">with no exit it is not sustainable he</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.850" end="00:20:11.350" style="s2">sees it very clearly and in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.880" end="00:20:15.110" style="s2">he sees it from a modern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.350" end="00:20:19.100" style="s2">very brilliant modern perspective he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.110" end="00:20:21.920" style="s2">and he has a depth because of his</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.100" end="00:20:23.960" style="s2">understanding of Carl Jung and his own</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.920" end="00:20:26.690" style="s2">work in psychology the field of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.960" end="00:20:30.250" style="s2">psychology that is deeper than most</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.690" end="00:20:35.180" style="s2">people so people are drawn to that depth</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.250" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">he sees something much deeper then other</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.180" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">people are seeing right now we had had</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:41.930" style="s2">we&#39;d never met one another and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.190" end="00:20:42.920" style="s2">actually very little about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.930" end="00:20:46.580" style="s2">Peterson his written word</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.920" end="00:20:50.090" style="s2">he knew pretty little about mine and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.580" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">were just told sit down and shoot and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.090" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">had no idea where we were going so he</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:55.190" style="s2">just started talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.560" style="s2">so why the master his emissary and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.190" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">just went from there but what I felt was</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.560" end="00:21:04.790" style="s2">here was you know a super intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:06.890" style="s2">man who had wide-ranging interests in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.790" end="00:21:08.430" style="s2">psychology philosophy and didn&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.890" end="00:21:11.340" style="s2">out a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.430" end="00:21:13.920" style="s2">or two things and I don&#39;t think that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.340" end="00:21:15.810" style="s2">would and in the film I in that clip I</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.920" end="00:21:17.460" style="s2">think it probably comes out that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.810" end="00:21:20.430" style="s2">are aspects of what Jordan was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.460" end="00:21:24.570" style="s2">that I was getting well yes but so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.430" end="00:21:28.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t entirely kind of I&#39;m not a Peter</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:31.050" style="s2">Peter Sounion but I do have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.170" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">respect for him and we had a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.050" end="00:21:35.970" style="s2">conversation and we were proposing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:37.770" style="s2">more what do you make of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.970" end="00:21:40.170" style="s2">criticisms cuz often he&#39;s described as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.770" end="00:21:41.790" style="s2">fraud or a charlatan in some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.170" end="00:21:43.050" style="s2">media coverage but when you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.790" end="00:21:44.970" style="s2">interview with yourself I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.050" end="00:21:46.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a very high-level conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.970" end="00:21:48.300" style="s2">the idea of him as a fraud or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.170" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">charlatan just seems kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.300" end="00:21:56.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s outrageous it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.980" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">disrespectful its dismissive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.040" end="00:22:02.430" style="s2">entirely typical of blinkered liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">he you can disagree with him about many</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.430" end="00:22:08.250" style="s2">things and I would disagree with him</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:12.690" style="s2">about a number of things but to say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.250" end="00:22:20.270" style="s2">is just to show how painted you are he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.690" end="00:22:23.820" style="s2">clearly an extraordinary man and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.270" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">I think what strikes people is that he</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.820" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">was relatively unknown and then he</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.880" style="s2">became known but that&#39;s what life isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:31.380" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t prove for a showers yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.880" end="00:22:33.570" style="s2">mean a lot of this sounds quite Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.380" end="00:22:36.270" style="s2">Peters and ask what&#39;s your attitude</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.570" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">Jordan Peterson yeah I mean I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.270" end="00:22:41.550" style="s2">he&#39;s out there and I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:42.810" style="s2">yeah I mean I think at a minimum there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.550" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">sort of three different jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.810" end="00:22:46.350" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s you know there&#39;s Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">Peterson the analyst and academic which</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.350" end="00:22:51.150" style="s2">essentially nobody ever heard of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:53.100" style="s2">Jordan Peterson the kind of contrary and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.150" end="00:22:55.680" style="s2">public intellectual which sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.100" end="00:22:57.210" style="s2">know kicked off in 2016 and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.680" end="00:22:59.790" style="s2">sort of Jordan Peterson sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.210" end="00:23:03.240" style="s2">Rorschach blot for the culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.790" end="00:23:05.400" style="s2">which both left and right wildly distort</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.240" end="00:23:08.190" style="s2">who he is what he&#39;s saying and what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.400" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">and and what it means for them and so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.190" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2">get we get the the second and the third</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.470" style="s2">ones completely mixed although the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.550" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">one you know University of Toronto and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.470" end="00:23:16.260" style="s2">hopping your former Harvard professors</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:18.570" style="s2">the one that gives the credibility and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.260" end="00:23:20.360" style="s2">the weight to the other two dialogues so</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.570" end="00:23:23.150" style="s2">in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.360" end="00:23:25.250" style="s2">I think as I what I imagine him to be as</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.150" end="00:23:27.140" style="s2">an actual man is a pretty high integrity</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.250" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">principled person who likes to think for</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.140" end="00:23:32.440" style="s2">himself and likes to speak not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">truth to power but but also likes to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.440" end="00:23:38.690" style="s2">remind his audience whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:40.190" style="s2">students or broader than that what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">is you know what is the what is the life</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.190" end="00:23:45.170" style="s2">well a good life well lived and now</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.880" style="s2">there I think there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.170" end="00:23:52.220" style="s2">problems in how in the age of soundbites</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.880" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">and hundreds of hours of footage and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.220" end="00:23:56.330" style="s2">tons of speaking and those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.670" style="s2">things that become problematic and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.330" end="00:24:00.380" style="s2">not in any way convinced that if I sat</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.670" end="00:24:02.060" style="s2">down with him and said hey mate what</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.380" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">about this bit that he would actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.060" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">stand a defendant but impressions I get</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">would be that his I think he sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:13.670" style="s2">over catastrophize is the slippery slope</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:15.410" style="s2">to Marxism in the sense that that all</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.670" end="00:24:17.330" style="s2">that you know this way lies Stalinist</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.410" end="00:24:22.370" style="s2">death camps therefore we cannot give one</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.810" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">peril I do I just think sometimes he</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.500" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">uses the slippery slope argument maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:49.400" style="s2">think it pulls it out just sometimes a</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.220" end="00:25:27.500" style="s2">directly traceable in at least in the US</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2">real clear is that left in liberal we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">no longer the same the old original</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:03.320" style="s2">leftists were liberals but the new</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:08.450" style="s2">leftists were illiberal their anti</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:16.010" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re somebody like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.790" end="00:26:18.710" style="s2">Peterson who is thinking integrally and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.010" end="00:26:21.470" style="s2">you&#39;re looking around and seeing what</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.820" end="00:28:57.399" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I think it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.889" end="00:29:00.250" style="s2">that an intellectual that is young in</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.399" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">who is you know who speaks in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.250" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">often of metaphor and an allegory that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:10.179" style="s2">he has risen to such extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:13.480" style="s2">success and I think it is in part a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.179" end="00:29:15.340" style="s2">result of our enormous hunger we you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.480" end="00:29:18.250" style="s2">know we have we&#39;ve attached to two</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:25.179" style="s2">hand and Jordan Peterson on the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.090" end="00:29:27.519" style="s2">two ends of the extreme in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.179" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s been willing to say you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.519" end="00:29:31.750" style="s2">know fathers are important families are</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:35.309" style="s2">important and so Jordan and I found</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">ourselves in a hour-and-a-half dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.309" end="00:29:40.179" style="s2">in which I would give a you know I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:42.659" style="s2">talk about fathers in roughhousing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.179" end="00:29:46.149" style="s2">he would talk about some intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.659" end="00:29:48.190" style="s2">Piaget or someone else who was you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.149" end="00:29:51.430" style="s2">who was in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.190" end="00:29:53.230" style="s2">or in Disney movies or something else</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.430" end="00:29:55.810" style="s2">that related to that and it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.230" end="00:29:58.270" style="s2">fascinating hour-and-a-half I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.810" end="00:29:59.980" style="s2">because you know I&#39;m usually when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.270" end="00:30:03.160" style="s2">being interviewed I don&#39;t learn a great</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.980" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">deal but I certainly learned it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.160" end="00:30:09.310" style="s2">wonderful the way we learned from each</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:13.240" style="s2">other and you&#39;re you&#39;re from Canada yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.310" end="00:30:15.310" style="s2">one of the the the biggest phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.240" end="00:30:17.770" style="s2">the last couple of years has been Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.310" end="00:30:20.170" style="s2">Peterson yeah what have we made of him</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.770" end="00:30:22.390" style="s2">his rise and what it says about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.170" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">culture that people are so thirsting for</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.390" end="00:30:26.920" style="s2">what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.330" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">Peterson first was very bright</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.920" end="00:30:33.370" style="s2">I saw Denis articulate and in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:36.010" style="s2">a compelling speaker so he said he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.370" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">attractive figure in some ways when I</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.010" end="00:30:41.290" style="s2">read him I sense a lot of suppressed</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:43.570" style="s2">rage in him in fact I think his voice is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.290" end="00:30:45.130" style="s2">choking with a Rachel out of a time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.570" end="00:30:46.780" style="s2">interesting as he talks about rage that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.130" end="00:30:48.100" style="s2">you have to deal with that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.780" end="00:30:50.860" style="s2">you&#39;ll understand just how angry he is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.100" end="00:30:56.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s and if you look at his websites</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.860" end="00:30:59.920" style="s2">the comments were full of rage by his</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.920" end="00:31:02.950" style="s2">young acolytes well that&#39;s an energetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.920" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s his energy that draws</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.950" end="00:31:09.040" style="s2">people as much as what he actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">teaches secondly he teaches a repression</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.040" end="00:31:16.900" style="s2">I mean he he very rightly takes an issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:19.270" style="s2">where somebody mandates the cencon</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.900" end="00:31:21.700" style="s2">language and he very rightly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.270" end="00:31:23.290" style="s2">righteously since up I will not be</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">dictated to about what language I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.290" end="00:31:27.850" style="s2">gonna use but good for him</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:32.290" style="s2">I&#39;m all in favor of not mandating</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.850" end="00:31:37.080" style="s2">language on the one hand on the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.290" end="00:31:39.700" style="s2">hand he basically advocates repression</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.080" end="00:31:41.800" style="s2">in his book he talks about how an angry</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.700" end="00:31:44.740" style="s2">to your child needs to be sit by</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.800" end="00:31:46.900" style="s2">themselves until they get over it rather</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.740" end="00:31:47.460" style="s2">than understanding why a child would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.900" end="00:31:50.789" style="s2">angry</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.460" end="00:31:53.220" style="s2">- what frustrations are having and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.789" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">human contact they need to help them</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.220" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">move through that anger he says repress</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">the anger so he&#39;s all about repressed</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.130" style="s2">anger for example circuit and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:03.690" style="s2">interesting he talks about children you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.130" end="00:32:05.700" style="s2">have some little varmints and little</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.690" end="00:32:08.100" style="s2">monsters and so on I know that&#39;s meant</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.700" end="00:32:10.500" style="s2">to be humorous but it&#39;s also certain way</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.100" end="00:32:12.899" style="s2">of thinking of the young human child so</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.500" end="00:32:16.049" style="s2">fundamentally I steam as an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.899" end="00:32:21.390" style="s2">repression he posing as an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.049" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">libertarianism not to mention he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">this big in his bonnet about what he</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">considers to be seems to consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">conspiracies by left-wing intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">they seem to be his bete noire being a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:38.130" style="s2">left-wing intellectual myself I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.279" style="s2">to talk to him so now what we so upset</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.130" end="00:32:42.270" style="s2">about Jordan what are you so afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.279" end="00:32:45.240" style="s2">you know he talks about these bloody</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.270" end="00:32:50.789" style="s2">Marxists and and any any points are very</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.240" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">accurately all the horror that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.789" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">under so-called Marxist regimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:32:58.380" style="s2">particularly in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:33:00.690" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely accurate about that but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.380" end="00:33:02.220" style="s2">then he promotes Christianity shall I</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.690" end="00:33:04.250" style="s2">tell him about the mass murders that</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.220" end="00:33:06.450" style="s2">occurred in the name of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.250" end="00:33:07.799" style="s2">should I tell him about all the millions</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.450" end="00:33:10.830" style="s2">that were slaughtered in the names of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.799" end="00:33:14.909" style="s2">the gentle Jesus in other words let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.830" end="00:33:18.500" style="s2">fair about it he seems to pick</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.909" end="00:33:20.940" style="s2">ideologies to attack and abhor and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.500" end="00:33:24.779" style="s2">embrace other ideologies that are just</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.940" end="00:33:27.390" style="s2">as murderers in practice sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.779" end="00:33:30.029" style="s2">a much more interesting question for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.390" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">what happened in Eastern Europe how come</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.029" end="00:33:33.929" style="s2">under an ideology it was meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:35.820" style="s2">liberate people so many people who were</p>
