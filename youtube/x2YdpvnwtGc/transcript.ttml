<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">addiction is best viewed not as a crime</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">or an illness but as a coping mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">for a personal spiritual crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">addiction is a response to human</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:29.429" style="s2">suffering it&#39;s an attempt of a human</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">being to feel actually normal and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.429" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">rather than a disease or a choice it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">really is a coping mechanism social</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:39.469" style="s2">media there&#39;s been a lot in the press</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">around our addiction to social media so</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.469" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">what do you feel drives that are our</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:45.110" style="s2">unhealthy relationship with it because</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">of the same dynamics there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.110" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">well you can use social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">responsibly just you can exercise</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">responsibly or you can exercise</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">addictively or you can use social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">effectively so stay internal</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">relationship to them these activities</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">that defines whether addictive or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">now if you&#39;re using something for</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">temporary relief for pain pain relief or</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">pleasure and you crave it despite</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">negative consequences you were an</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">addiction whereas if you&#39;re using social</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">media not to escape the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">distress not because you&#39;re craving it</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">but something because it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">modality and you don&#39;t suffer negative</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">consequences then it&#39;s not an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:34.549" style="s2">so it&#39;s not the external behavior I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">you can drink alcohol not addictively</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.549" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">you can have sex not effectively you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">go shopping monitor activity or you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">engage in all the activities in a purely</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.189" style="s2">compulsive addictive fashion depending</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">what the internal automatic dynamic is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.189" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">does it provide temporary pleasure pain</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">relief do you crave it and you continue</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">with that despite negative consequences</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what toys whether it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">addiction now broadly speaking social</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">media are highly addictive and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">people addicted and then having a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">devastating effects on their lives but</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">not of course everybody especially on</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">social media or just in general we that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">this polarization seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">increasingly ideological you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.690" style="s2">people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">really in their specific tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">speaking from you know let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">chance to hit the other tribe</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">okay can we be a dictatorial adji well</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">again if you define addiction as I do as</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">any behavior that a person craves finds</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">temporary pleasure or relief and suffers</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:38.130" style="s2">negative consequences and cannot give up</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:38.670" style="s2">despite negative consequences that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.130" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">addiction</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.670" end="00:02:44.340" style="s2">again I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s sex</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">gambling ideology or cocaine and and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.340" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">brain circuits are the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">brain circuits are involved in all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">addictions so we think there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:55.020" style="s2">different addictions if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:56.610" style="s2">look at the addicted brain it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.020" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">brain circuitry that&#39;s involved in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">addictions so an ideology that allows</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">you free expression of the impulses you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">will get to hit somebody if you&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">get it through a window to a rock</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:20.840" style="s2">through somebody&#39;s window or a verbal</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">bombed to their personal sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.840" end="00:03:27.269" style="s2">if it if you&#39;re lacking a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">personal power but the ideology gives</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.269" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">you a pseudo environment may belong to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">something really important if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:41.130" style="s2">meaning in your life and the etiology</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">gives you a pseudo meaning if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.130" end="00:03:44.880" style="s2">lacking genuine pleasure in your life</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">and you get the pseudo pleasure of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">connecting with people who see things</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">the same way an etiology can function</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:55.140" style="s2">like an addiction and furthermore it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">invites denial it&#39;s just like addiction</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.140" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">of is the right so now when I was in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">addicted behavior which I have been I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:02.760" style="s2">was in total denial that was an addict</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:04.049" style="s2">to me was just a natural thing to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.760" end="00:04:06.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the cost was to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.049" end="00:04:07.769" style="s2">people are on me hey doggies can do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.420" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">same thing you&#39;re in total denial about</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.769" end="00:04:12.299" style="s2">the impact on yourself or on others so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">yeah it is you can function like an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.299" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">addiction and you mentioned the the word</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:19.950" style="s2">meaning which really is is the word</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.660" end="00:04:21.599" style="s2">that&#39;s come up a lot with a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.950" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">guests and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.599" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">sense that what we&#39;re seeing now with</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">the increased polarization the chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">world Paulette</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">is driven in large part by a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">void a loss of connection and meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">remember in the book as well you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:40.200" style="s2">mentioned that&#39;s an aspect of drug</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">addiction as well would you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.200" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">that general sense that we are facing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:52.169" style="s2">global maybe void in meaning well</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:54.360" style="s2">there&#39;s an American psychologist who had</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.169" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">the human beings are all creatures with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.360" end="00:04:59.540" style="s2">special needs and I think one of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">special needs is for meaning our lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.540" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">are not meant to be just lived for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">daily sake of physical existence now</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">that meaning in a tribal setting is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">automatically provided for you because</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:17.130" style="s2">you&#39;re bigger than yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.320" style="s2">belong to something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.130" end="00:05:20.100" style="s2">yourself and when you&#39;re connected with</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.320" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.100" end="00:05:27.510" style="s2">you&#39;re connected with some spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">practice or belief you have some meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.510" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">that transcends your daily struggles for</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:38.970" style="s2">survival of a society as feelings reduce</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:41.669" style="s2">stuff like we talked about meeting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.970" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">and we talked about broad values such as</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.669" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">freedom and democracy and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what people experience in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:50.190" style="s2">their daily lives nobody experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.060" end="00:05:51.780" style="s2">democracy in our lives mostly people</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">work in institutions we&#39;re told what to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.780" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">do and they had no voice in a matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:06:04.350" style="s2">and the freedom is really used to making</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">choices in meaningless alternatives so</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.350" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep and and as more more</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">disconnection as we&#39;ve already mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.740" end="00:06:11.729" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s a deep lack of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">meaning in people&#39;s lives the addictions</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.729" end="00:06:16.729" style="s2">can actually certainly come along and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">provide a false temporary but</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.729" end="00:06:24.750" style="s2">momentarily satisfactory sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:27.750" style="s2">meaning and meaning is is important to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.750" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">all of us we all want to feel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.750" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">something more significant about our</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:33.720" style="s2">lives than simply the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">dinner and evening and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.720" end="00:06:39.030" style="s2">in the morning on that point around this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">devastating effect we&#39;ve talked a lot on</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">the channel and some of our guests have</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:50.790" style="s2">the people are very entrenched in camps</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.220" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">particularly on social media and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.790" end="00:06:55.230" style="s2">know we&#39;ve also talked around how we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">trapped in kind of fight or flight I</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:06.210" style="s2">get an understanding of that a broader</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.990" end="00:07:09.480" style="s2">understanding of how we behave on social</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.210" end="00:07:11.430" style="s2">media well first of all what&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.480" end="00:07:14.010" style="s2">in this society is that people are less</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.430" end="00:07:16.230" style="s2">than as connected human beings were not</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.010" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">meant to live in these from the</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.070" end="00:07:37.230" style="s2">connection in between people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.169" end="00:07:39.000" style="s2">how we&#39;ve lived for the most part for</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:45.270" style="s2">until really quite recently there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:47.130" style="s2">lot of disconnect in in society people</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.270" end="00:07:48.480" style="s2">that literally don&#39;t know their</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:06.210" style="s2">and so what do people have on social</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.729" end="00:08:06.540" style="s2">media they have friends they like each</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.210" end="00:08:08.850" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.540" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">these are attachment dynamics these are</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:14.970" style="s2">aren&#39;t real friends cause real friends</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.450" end="00:08:17.640" style="s2">know you and you&#39;re not afraid to show</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.220" end="00:08:29.820" style="s2">individual never gets the sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">really liked because they know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.820" end="00:08:35.070" style="s2">just an image that&#39;s being liked and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">the so-called friends are not there for</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.070" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">you when you need them and you&#39;d use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:42.690" style="s2">same language liking and friends are</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.810" end="00:08:45.100" style="s2">very strong language but social media is</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.100" end="00:08:49.330" style="s2">so the less it meets your real needs the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.770" end="00:08:52.900" style="s2">more addictive it is because the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.330" end="00:08:56.380" style="s2">more what you need to get number one</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.380" end="00:09:01.960" style="s2">but it certainly revealed the many</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.400" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">subcultures in the society and allows</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.630" end="00:09:15.430" style="s2">pseudo camaraderie so we can all hate</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.090" end="00:09:20.920" style="s2">the same thing we can all be hostile to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.430" end="00:09:24.730" style="s2">the same people and anybody can express</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.920" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">an opinion in the old days of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.730" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">newsletters to the newspapers people</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:30.810" style="s2">have to repeat irresponsible what they</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">wrote they had to identify themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.810" end="00:09:35.320" style="s2">social media you can say anything you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:41.260" style="s2">want about anybody doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.320" end="00:09:43.510" style="s2">hurtful or wrong hateful really and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.260" end="00:09:46.150" style="s2">even identify yourself so it allows</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.510" end="00:09:49.210" style="s2">people who otherwise are on the margins</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.150" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">of society to aggregate in these pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.210" end="00:09:55.930" style="s2">groups that then promote one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.190" style="s2">most negative tendencies and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.930" end="00:09:59.140" style="s2">good guidance there there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.190" end="00:10:01.420" style="s2">leadership there&#39;s nobody to call you to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.140" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">your senses there&#39;s nobody to say really</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.420" end="00:10:05.620" style="s2">do you really mean that is that what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:09.580" style="s2">really intend what&#39;s really going on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.620" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">there&#39;s peer groupings without any kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.580" end="00:10:14.080" style="s2">of guidance it&#39;s really like a teenage</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:16.600" style="s2">gang phenomenon where people band</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.080" end="00:10:19.060" style="s2">together mostly for negative reasons</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.600" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">they&#39;re lacking contact so they need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.060" end="00:10:23.170" style="s2">band together so that&#39;s legitimate but</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:25.950" style="s2">they they get they band together without</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.170" end="00:10:29.350" style="s2">mentorship without tradition without</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.950" end="00:10:32.200" style="s2">adult guidance and so we see what we see</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.350" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">yeah and so is you feeling that in those</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.200" end="00:10:35.650" style="s2">groups specially if there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:38.680" style="s2">hateful rhetoric in it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.650" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">what would be your kind of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.680" end="00:10:44.590" style="s2">sense of what a way through that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">be or a way to reach those people well I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.590" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a way to reach</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:51.020" style="s2">those people except to a personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:52.780" style="s2">contact I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.020" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.780" end="00:10:58.670" style="s2">should take the analogy of the teenage</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.920" end="00:11:00.470" style="s2">gang only if somebody comes along who</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">can provide genuine guidance that these</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.470" end="00:11:07.780" style="s2">people will trust but with the social</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:09.710" style="s2">media groups who knows where they live</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.780" end="00:11:12.740" style="s2">who knows how to contact them</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.710" end="00:11:14.950" style="s2">individually who knows how to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.740" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">them in a way that&#39;s compassionate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.950" end="00:11:23.110" style="s2">enrolling at the same time that&#39;ll open</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:23.110" style="s2">up a different parts of themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:28.070" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know that the social media</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:31.220" style="s2">causes all that or simply reinforces it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.070" end="00:11:32.750" style="s2">or maybe makes it more manifest I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.220" end="00:11:35.150" style="s2">you&#39;ve always had these bookings</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.750" end="00:11:37.130" style="s2">they just haven&#39;t found a way to at</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.150" end="00:11:39.620" style="s2">least evolves that such people they just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.130" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">haven&#39;t found a way to reinforce and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.620" end="00:11:44.330" style="s2">validate so they&#39;re quite at the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.660" end="00:11:47.750" style="s2">degree as you have it now yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.330" end="00:11:49.130" style="s2">very interested reading in the book you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.750" end="00:11:51.560" style="s2">use the example if there&#39;s an area of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.130" end="00:11:55.460" style="s2">the brain called the OFC yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.560" end="00:11:57.140" style="s2">kind of it mediates in part it picks up</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.460" end="00:11:59.230" style="s2">on physical emotional cues and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.140" end="00:12:01.370" style="s2">big part of how we trust each other and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.230" end="00:12:02.900" style="s2">as I was reading it I was thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.370" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">that&#39;s something we certainly can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.900" end="00:12:08.270" style="s2">online and can only happen face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:10.610" style="s2">and so yeah it sounds like to have these</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.270" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">authentic conversations we need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.610" end="00:12:13.670" style="s2">contact well you see the as you and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:16.790" style="s2">are speaking to each other early uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.670" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;re tracking each other&#39;s face and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.790" end="00:12:22.190" style="s2">our ear muscles are actually adjusting</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:24.020" style="s2">themselves automatically to hear not</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.190" end="00:12:27.350" style="s2">just what&#39;s being said but also the tone</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.020" end="00:12:29.240" style="s2">of voice image being said and you will</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.350" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">nod when I say something or I might nod</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.240" end="00:12:33.260" style="s2">or smile when you say something so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.690" style="s2">communication is as much about these</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.260" end="00:12:38.150" style="s2">nonverbal cues which are meeting it to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:40.670" style="s2">nervous nervous system as it is about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.150" end="00:12:43.010" style="s2">the verbal content now none of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.670" end="00:12:45.770" style="s2">exists on social media it&#39;s not genuine</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.010" end="00:12:50.260" style="s2">communication human communication is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.770" end="00:12:50.260" style="s2">almost mentally face-to-face and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.940" style="s2">even if I would a lot write a letter to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.490" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">somebody that was gonna mail that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.940" end="00:13:04.410" style="s2">much more conscious and deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:06.060" style="s2">process than dashing something of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.410" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">social media and pushing the send button</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.060" end="00:13:13.140" style="s2">in a state of tizzy you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">it&#39;s much less impulsive so social media</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.140" end="00:13:19.380" style="s2">really takes away the the nuts and bolts</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:21.720" style="s2">of human communication and provides only</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.380" end="00:13:24.060" style="s2">the surface manifestation of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.720" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">so what masquerade as communication is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.060" end="00:13:28.170" style="s2">really diatribes very often and I know</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.529" end="00:20:34.409" style="s2">great insights that they both had and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:37.350" style="s2">learned a lot from both but they both</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.409" end="00:20:38.789" style="s2">ignored trauma and I think the trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.350" end="00:20:42.389" style="s2">the missing piece in modern psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.789" end="00:20:43.740" style="s2">and modern education modern medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.389" end="00:20:46.789" style="s2">so I think that without looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.740" end="00:20:51.419" style="s2">trauma speaking of the shadow side</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.789" end="00:20:54.869" style="s2">remains somewhat shallow and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.419" end="00:20:58.169" style="s2">you&#39;re from Canada yeah one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.869" end="00:21:00.210" style="s2">biggest phenomenon of the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.169" end="00:21:03.299" style="s2">years has been Jordan Peterson yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.210" end="00:21:05.070" style="s2">have you made of him his rise and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.299" end="00:21:07.350" style="s2">it says about the culture that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.070" end="00:21:08.029" style="s2">are so thirsting for what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.350" end="00:21:10.759" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.029" end="00:21:14.519" style="s2">Peterson first was very bright</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.759" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">extraordinaire tick youlet and in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.519" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">ways a compelling speaker so he said</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:21.580" style="s2">he&#39;s an attractive figure in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">when I read him I sense a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.580" end="00:21:26.409" style="s2">suppressed rage in him in fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:26.890" style="s2">his voice is choking with a rage alot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.409" end="00:21:28.510" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.890" end="00:21:30.220" style="s2">it&#39;s anything if he talks about rage</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.510" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">that he have to deal with it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.220" end="00:21:34.539" style="s2">think you&#39;ll understand just angry yet</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:40.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s and if you look at his websites</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.539" end="00:21:41.710" style="s2">the comments were full of rage by his</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.600" end="00:21:45.880" style="s2">young acolytes</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.710" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">now that&#39;s an energetic thing it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.880" end="00:21:52.299" style="s2">energy that draws people as much as what</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:56.049" style="s2">he actually teaches secondly he teaches</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.299" end="00:21:59.830" style="s2">a repression I mean he he very rightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.049" end="00:22:02.620" style="s2">takes an issue where somebody mandates</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.830" end="00:22:05.380" style="s2">the cencon language and he very rightly</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.620" end="00:22:07.000" style="s2">and righteously since above all not be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.380" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">dictated to about what language I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.000" end="00:22:15.610" style="s2">gonna use well good for him I&#39;m on favor</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.360" end="00:22:19.419" style="s2">of not mandating language on one hand on</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.610" end="00:22:22.630" style="s2">the other hand he basically advocates</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.419" end="00:22:25.029" style="s2">repression in his book he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.630" end="00:22:27.419" style="s2">how an angry to your child needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.029" end="00:22:30.370" style="s2">sit by themselves until they get over it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.419" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">rather than understanding why a child</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.370" end="00:22:35.559" style="s2">would be angry rage - what frustrations</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:37.389" style="s2">are having and what human contact they</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.559" end="00:22:40.539" style="s2">need to help them move through that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.389" end="00:22:41.950" style="s2">anger he says repress the anger so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.539" end="00:22:44.860" style="s2">all about repressed anger for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.950" end="00:22:46.149" style="s2">circuit and it&#39;s very interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:48.039" style="s2">he talks about children you have some</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.149" end="00:22:49.929" style="s2">little varmints and little monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.039" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">so on I know that&#39;s meant to be humorous</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.929" end="00:22:55.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s also certain way of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">the young human child so fundamentally I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.210" end="00:23:03.340" style="s2">steam as an agent of repression he</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">posing as an agent of libertarianism not</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.340" end="00:23:08.380" style="s2">to mention he&#39;s got this big in his</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:11.830" style="s2">bonnet about what he considers to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.380" end="00:23:15.309" style="s2">seems to consider to be conspiracies by</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.830" end="00:23:18.100" style="s2">left-wing intellectuals they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.309" end="00:23:20.590" style="s2">his Buettner are being a left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.100" end="00:23:21.850" style="s2">intellectual myself I&#39;d like to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.590" end="00:23:24.970" style="s2">him so now what were you so upset about</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:25.960" style="s2">Jordan what are you so afraid of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.970" end="00:23:28.840" style="s2">know he talks about these bloody</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.960" end="00:23:29.920" style="s2">Marxists and and any any points are very</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.840" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">accurately</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.920" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">all the horror that occurred under</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:38.980" style="s2">so-called Marxist regimes particularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.980" end="00:23:44.380" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely accurate about that but</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:45.910" style="s2">then he promotes Christianity shall I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.380" end="00:23:46.900" style="s2">tell him about the mass murders that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.910" end="00:23:49.930" style="s2">occurred in the name of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.900" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">should I tell him about all the millions</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.930" end="00:23:54.520" style="s2">that were slaughtered in the names of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:58.600" style="s2">the gentle Jesus in other words let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.520" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">fair about it he seems to pick</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.600" end="00:24:04.630" style="s2">ideologies to attack and abhor and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:08.470" style="s2">embrace other ideologies that are just</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.630" end="00:24:11.080" style="s2">as murderers in practice sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.470" end="00:24:13.690" style="s2">a much more interesting question for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.080" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">what happened in Eastern Europe how come</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.690" end="00:24:17.620" style="s2">under an ideology it was meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:19.510" style="s2">liberate people so many people were</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.620" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">oppressed I come from Eastern Europe I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.510" end="00:24:23.680" style="s2">was born in Hungary he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:26.440" style="s2">tell me about what was like but how</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.680" end="00:24:28.390" style="s2">about asking how come a religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:32.020" style="s2">philosophy that was meant to promote</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.390" end="00:24:35.680" style="s2">love and acceptance and compassion has</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.020" end="00:24:37.470" style="s2">become such an agent of two million a of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.680" end="00:24:41.830" style="s2">repression oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.470" end="00:24:43.660" style="s2">and-and-and-and-and killing so can we be</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.660" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">tribal about it I have a lot to say to</p>
