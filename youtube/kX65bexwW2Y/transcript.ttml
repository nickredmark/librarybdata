<p begin="00:00:00.789" end="00:00:05.590" style="s2">hi again in the spirit of adding and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.970" end="00:00:07.029" style="s2">broadening perspective which is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.590" end="00:00:08.890" style="s2">rule Omega is all about I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.029" end="00:00:10.690" style="s2">might be nice to do a follow-up to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.890" end="00:00:15.010" style="s2">last video I did which was about rule</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.690" end="00:00:16.330" style="s2">Omega and myself and three people from a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.010" end="00:00:18.610" style="s2">group to get together reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.330" end="00:00:20.619" style="s2">regularly to practice our rule Omega</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.610" end="00:00:23.199" style="s2">skills if you like I had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.619" end="00:00:26.619" style="s2">about rule Omega itself and so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.199" end="00:00:28.359" style="s2">it might be fun for you to watch that so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.619" end="00:00:29.109" style="s2">without any further ado here it is I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.359" end="00:00:31.960" style="s2">hope you enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.109" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">rendering unto signal what is signal so</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.960" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">up regulating and rendering into noise</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:41.429" style="s2">what is noise so down regulating</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:43.600" style="s2">basically means you know assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.429" end="00:00:45.940" style="s2">that the person that you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:48.850" style="s2">is intelligent and they have information</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.940" end="00:00:53.889" style="s2">that you don&#39;t and searching for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:54.699" style="s2">and seeking to understand it and some</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.889" end="00:00:58.979" style="s2">amplifier</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.699" end="00:01:01.059" style="s2">I suppose while also understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.979" end="00:01:03.940" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re dealing with something</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.059" end="00:01:06.700" style="s2">that is a new unknown topic that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.940" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">going to be a lot of you know searching</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.700" end="00:01:15.640" style="s2">around finding ways of expressing things</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:17.290" style="s2">that may not be may not be easy and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.640" end="00:01:20.050" style="s2">result of that is going to end up being</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.290" end="00:01:21.940" style="s2">a fair bit of noise you know so or</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.050" end="00:01:23.860" style="s2">static so which makes it difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.940" end="00:01:25.300" style="s2">hear the signal so that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.860" end="00:01:28.390" style="s2">listening to someone else you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.300" end="00:01:31.450" style="s2">to ignore and suppress that to some</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.390" end="00:01:34.210" style="s2">extent and bring the you know the bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.450" end="00:01:36.610" style="s2">truth that&#39;s there and amplify it to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.210" end="00:01:38.140" style="s2">point that that everyone else can hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.610" end="00:01:42.100" style="s2">it and that you can continue working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.140" end="00:01:45.450" style="s2">I was like sort of building up this you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.100" end="00:01:46.690" style="s2">know increasing view of clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.690" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">I suppose that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">really good intro for a really good</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">definition of the Omega I think one</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">thing that shown now brought up I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">in a previous conversation was the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">that in a conversation noise can also be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">coming from the listener as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:19.630" style="s2">listening they can be the listener can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">be bringing their own you know their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.630" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">misunderstandings their own lenses of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">trauma that they might be viewing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">situation through and so exactly as you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">described it&#39;s it comes down to both</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:46.680" style="s2">both looking for the signal</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">understanding that the distortion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">signal may not entirely be coming from</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:52.920" style="s2">the other person may not be coming from</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:56.850" style="s2">the other person at all it may be it may</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">be coming from you and and maybe you you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.850" end="00:03:02.190" style="s2">have a you know maybe you define a word</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">wrong and the other person actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.190" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">makes complete sense maybe neither of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:07.079" style="s2">you are defining a word wrong maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">you&#39;re just defining the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.079" end="00:03:11.180" style="s2">differently but because of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:13.769" style="s2">difference of definition there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.180" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">complete dissonance between the two of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.769" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">you when in fact the underlying signal</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">is actually the same and your meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s just I guess getting a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">little bit more specific but I I I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve pretty fully back up everything you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">said Kylee yeah I think both of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:37.260" style="s2">are very important I liked your</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:40.350" style="s2">definition kind of like Chad on Heather</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.260" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">that um I got is what I thought signal</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.350" end="00:03:43.829" style="s2">was was in listener like into what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">speaker is saying but it&#39;s like up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.829" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">the listener to kind of separate to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">like what is here that is real and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.579" style="s2">am I making it mean right like what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">like when something happens an event</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:03:57.780" style="s2">happens we don&#39;t react to the event we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:03:59.459" style="s2">react to our story about the events</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">right so someone&#39;s late and we make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.459" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">mean that they&#39;re disrespectful and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">don&#39;t care about us and they know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:05.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know why they&#39;re actually late</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:08.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the reactions</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.710" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">ass right - fine wait why were you late</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.710" end="00:04:14.020" style="s2">instead of having that whole cascade and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">that yeah that is like fine this signal</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.020" end="00:04:18.190" style="s2">is in like the communication between</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">because both as the speaker isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.190" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">anywhere near as eloquent as I used to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">be and how I wish I was I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">lot of noise in my signal and yet I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">the signal is really important and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:32.140" style="s2">finding that in other people as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">like when someone says something that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.140" end="00:04:35.980" style="s2">am naturally curious about I&#39;m a much</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">better conversationalist than when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.980" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">have to fake it right when I have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:43.240" style="s2">like oh how is the weather today how are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">you doing how is like I can&#39;t even fake</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">that curiosity that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">I think one thing that&#39;s interesting too</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">is it almost becomes more important</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:58.970" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t say more important but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:00.949" style="s2">more relevant the farther you get away</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.970" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">from face-to-face communication because</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.949" end="00:05:05.389" style="s2">there&#39;s more and more opportunity for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">to break down so for example in facebook</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.389" end="00:05:13.009" style="s2">comments or on a tweet really easy to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:16.430" style="s2">misconstrued and yet people very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.009" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">tend to assume they know what someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.430" end="00:05:20.300" style="s2">means when in fact they may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:25.990" style="s2">completely misinterpreting that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.300" end="00:05:31.009" style="s2">words so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting it it it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.990" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">it it it applies differently in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.009" end="00:05:37.789" style="s2">asynchronous communication because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:40.370" style="s2">have to really slow down and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.789" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">just react you have to question you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.370" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">to you have to kind of ask for specifics</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:50.570" style="s2">and then the person has to reply so it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">can it can be quite slow but in the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.570" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">what is revealed and just like Eric you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:05:57.560" style="s2">talked about in your video you get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:05:59.539" style="s2">cylinder instead of the circle fighting</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.560" end="00:06:02.360" style="s2">with the square right over who&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.539" end="00:06:08.120" style="s2">yes it takes more time it takes patience</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.360" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">it takes discernment and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.120" end="00:06:16.520" style="s2">willing to be wrong and so with that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:18.620" style="s2">case you are wrong which you very well</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.520" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">may be but at the end if you can reveal</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.620" end="00:06:25.699" style="s2">a cylinder it&#39;s so rewarding and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so much more constructive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.699" end="00:06:30.349" style="s2">it then allows us to go on and have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">next step in whatever conversation might</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.349" end="00:06:39.229" style="s2">be unfolding and maybe reveal another</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:40.699" style="s2">cylinder and it also helps us to III I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.229" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">going to phrase this in a way that could</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.699" end="00:06:44.770" style="s2">be displeasing but I hope I put it right</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:47.690" style="s2">it also encourages us to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.770" end="00:06:49.250" style="s2">disagreement in dispute because you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.690" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">in that in that example I gave in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.250" end="00:06:53.090" style="s2">video of the cylinder if there if there</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:55.699" style="s2">is no argument between the two of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.090" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">then there&#39;s no possibility for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.699" end="00:06:58.969" style="s2">revelation oh my god it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:00.919" style="s2">three-dimensional shape not a</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.490" end="00:07:05.509" style="s2">both of them just walk past oh yeah it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.250" end="00:07:12.590" style="s2">argument is itself the the the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.669" end="00:07:15.229" style="s2">with generally without the argument</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.229" end="00:07:19.750" style="s2">so you know I I think yes I actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.660" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">like that analogy on a lot of levels</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.750" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">it&#39;s ease disagreement as an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.350" end="00:07:35.990" style="s2">yep well which you know which it</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.750" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">certainly is you also think about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.990" end="00:07:42.199" style="s2">know in a similar sort of vein like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.960" end="00:07:43.790" style="s2">diversity versus sameness gentleman if</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.199" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">everyone is coming from the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.790" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">perspective and seeing something as just</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:51.050" style="s2">a square or everyone is seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:53.630" style="s2">as just a circle then you never get us</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">full of picture as you do if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.630" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">you know someone kind of going okay from</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:08:00.919" style="s2">this angle it looks like it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:02.510" style="s2">this weird kind of shape like that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.919" end="00:08:06.199" style="s2">know which it could if you were just</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.510" end="00:08:07.760" style="s2">seeing it as a shadow someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.199" end="00:08:10.100" style="s2">seeing it is the square someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.760" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">seeing it is the you know as the circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.100" end="00:08:13.940" style="s2">and you kind of put them all together</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:17.150" style="s2">and you get that kind of picture but in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.940" end="00:08:19.370" style="s2">order to do that you&#39;ve not only have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.150" end="00:08:22.340" style="s2">have well actually maybe even an</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:24.310" style="s2">argument isn&#39;t necessary you just need</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.340" end="00:08:29.720" style="s2">to have the different perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.310" end="00:08:33.740" style="s2">allow them to to be expressed and heard</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.720" end="00:08:35.930" style="s2">and considered hope for me will you ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.740" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">talk about that and the disagreement is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.930" end="00:08:41.300" style="s2">that yes the spark is also the UM like</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">the community piece of it like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.300" end="00:08:45.260" style="s2">the only one who sees a square and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.510" style="s2">everybody else sees a circle that is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.260" end="00:08:49.100" style="s2">hard position to be in same with it like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.510" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna argue that your truth</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.100" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">is it your truth when it&#39;s only like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">says it any less true it&#39;s still like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:59.089" style="s2">was 50/50 it&#39;s the same rightness as if</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">it was 90 you know 10 but if you have no</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.089" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">one else backing you up it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">like just the dynamic of a group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:09.380" style="s2">very different if you&#39;re 5050 or if</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:11.060" style="s2">you&#39;re like the 1% 99% dynamic code of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.380" end="00:09:13.540" style="s2">discernment finding the noise in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.060" end="00:09:16.310" style="s2">signal right like we let that definitely</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.540" end="00:09:18.529" style="s2">permeate that culture is what we go off</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.310" end="00:09:20.990" style="s2">of right like if you think the moon</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.529" end="00:09:22.100" style="s2">landing is a hoax you&#39;re ridiculous even</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.990" end="00:09:24.140" style="s2">if you&#39;ve never looked into the moon</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.100" end="00:09:28.820" style="s2">landing right like cuz that&#39;s just our</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.140" end="00:09:30.050" style="s2">natural what we say in society and so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.820" end="00:09:34.459" style="s2">you haven&#39;t looked into it that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:36.200" style="s2">be your your your go-to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.459" end="00:09:38.150" style="s2">interesting there so the the there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.200" end="00:09:40.459" style="s2">false positive as well right in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.150" end="00:09:42.019" style="s2">signal there&#39;s the reading something a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.459" end="00:09:45.619" style="s2">signal which isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.019" end="00:09:47.059" style="s2">signal yeah it comes across to you as</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.619" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">signal but it isn&#39;t actually signal</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.059" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">again it&#39;s your noise turning noise into</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:53.239" style="s2">signals and turning noise into precede</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.980" style="s2">signal right which is why I think what</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.239" end="00:09:56.629" style="s2">Heather was saying before the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.980" end="00:10:00.139" style="s2">speaking back you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.629" end="00:10:02.509" style="s2">speaking back to people checking re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.139" end="00:10:04.309" style="s2">saying what they&#39;ve said clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.509" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">words that have been used that can that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.309" end="00:10:08.829" style="s2">can hold multiple definitions is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:11.569" style="s2">really really important part of not</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.829" end="00:10:13.549" style="s2">ending up in apparent conflict when as</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.569" end="00:10:15.799" style="s2">you said really your your signal is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.549" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">actually in alignment but because of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.799" end="00:10:19.059" style="s2">word you&#39;re using that you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:22.429" style="s2">differently it feels like they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.059" end="00:10:24.019" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed so many times that apparent</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.429" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">arguments actually come down to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.019" end="00:10:31.100" style="s2">definition of a single word but people</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.670" end="00:10:34.600" style="s2">using differently the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:37.670" style="s2">I had with my husband yesterday around</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.600" end="00:10:39.379" style="s2">around a discussion that&#39;s come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.670" end="00:10:41.619" style="s2">through the course of the year in one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.379" end="00:10:45.249" style="s2">his groups about professional courage</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.619" end="00:10:48.709" style="s2">and it&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s that willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.249" end="00:10:50.449" style="s2">leave what what the the group norm or</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.709" end="00:10:53.929" style="s2">the group understanding is and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.449" end="00:10:56.899" style="s2">actually express that you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.929" end="00:10:58.670" style="s2">different perspective and when we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.899" end="00:11:00.410" style="s2">talking about it I said you know hey I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:02.329" style="s2">wonder if when anyone&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.410" end="00:11:04.549" style="s2">that whether they think about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.329" end="00:11:07.309" style="s2">like the first follower or like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.549" end="00:11:10.850" style="s2">second person that&#39;s essentially coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.309" end="00:11:13.579" style="s2">in and applying rule Omega in their you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.850" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">know they&#39;re listening for that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.579" end="00:11:17.179" style="s2">dissenting opinion or that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:20.329" style="s2">different many thing ends and up</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.179" end="00:11:22.549" style="s2">regulating it enough so that the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.329" end="00:11:24.589" style="s2">the the rest of the group or the cool we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.549" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">can actually hear it as well because</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.589" end="00:11:29.660" style="s2">like one lone person as I was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:33.220" style="s2">difficult to be in that position as as</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.660" end="00:11:35.540" style="s2">Jubilee said but there&#39;s also that other</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.220" end="00:11:37.759" style="s2">other role or other thing that can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.540" end="00:11:40.509" style="s2">done which is the first person to apply</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.759" end="00:11:43.419" style="s2">rule of maegor in that setting</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.509" end="00:11:46.489" style="s2">completely changes the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.419" end="00:11:48.169" style="s2">that dissenting view point so that then</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.489" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s available for the up for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.169" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">group to listen to interesting things of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">you talk about like naming what is being</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">said in the group and minds you&#39;ve liked</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:03.339" style="s2">the circling dynamic and the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:05.770" style="s2">vulnerability of saying like la Heather</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.339" end="00:12:07.960" style="s2">I think you said this in a logical sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.770" end="00:12:10.330" style="s2">I have no problem doing that like in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.960" end="00:12:11.890" style="s2">oh what you said is there was a cylinder</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.330" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s a circle and a square got</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.890" end="00:12:17.740" style="s2">that but if it&#39;s like the actual I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:19.779" style="s2">know like being like you look like</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.740" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">you&#39;re frustrated that piece of it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.779" end="00:12:23.740" style="s2">really hard for me I don&#39;t know like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:25.330" style="s2">come into like I would rather be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.740" end="00:12:28.260" style="s2">person that sees the square when</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.330" end="00:12:31.660" style="s2">everyone else sees the circle then um</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.260" end="00:12:33.790" style="s2">name that everyone sees the circle and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.660" end="00:12:35.860" style="s2">see the square like I don&#39;t know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.790" end="00:12:37.450" style="s2">something Valle nura Belen thank</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.860" end="00:12:40.920" style="s2">goodness we have diversity that other</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.450" end="00:12:40.920" style="s2">people it&#39;s probably the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.570" end="00:12:50.110" style="s2">there&#39;s also there&#39;s something sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.810" end="00:12:52.360" style="s2">different from that but that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.110" end="00:12:54.670" style="s2">put out here which is that just because</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.360" end="00:12:57.550" style="s2">you apply rule Omega and the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.670" end="00:13:00.610" style="s2">person applies with Omega doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.550" end="00:13:03.850" style="s2">you&#39;re going to agree you could still</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.610" end="00:13:05.890" style="s2">have 99 percent disagreement but if</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.850" end="00:13:07.720" style="s2">you&#39;re both coming in good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.890" end="00:13:10.270" style="s2">applying rule Omega you will find the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.720" end="00:13:12.580" style="s2">one percent of residents and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.270" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">build something on to that but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.580" end="00:13:15.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:17.830" style="s2">in agreement we just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.940" end="00:13:20.440" style="s2">communicating well we can still</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.830" end="00:13:23.350" style="s2">fundamentally disagree and apply rule</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.440" end="00:13:25.720" style="s2">Omega but we can do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.350" end="00:13:30.779" style="s2">brings us closer to truth instead of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.720" end="00:13:30.779" style="s2">makes us fight and destroy each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.589" end="00:13:39.339" style="s2">one of these the very first conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.150" end="00:13:42.450" style="s2">we had where Eric and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.339" end="00:13:45.070" style="s2">about or we were talking about Hana and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.450" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">ended up finding that that you used</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.070" end="00:13:50.950" style="s2">honor the way that I use integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:52.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure about vice versa but um but</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.950" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">that was a really interesting example of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.690" end="00:13:58.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s like that was our signal was</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:59.950" style="s2">that you know that you know we both sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.360" end="00:14:02.500" style="s2">of thinking about the same concept but</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.950" end="00:14:08.020" style="s2">in a way the noise was the words</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.500" end="00:14:08.649" style="s2">themselves anyway we&#39;ve got right but</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.020" end="00:14:10.540" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.649" end="00:14:12.459" style="s2">from perfect we only have to use it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.540" end="00:14:14.529" style="s2">carefully especially when talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.459" end="00:14:17.619" style="s2">difficult things things that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.529" end="00:14:19.300" style="s2">about before you got to be that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.619" end="00:14:20.980" style="s2">exactly what you said Kyle I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.300" end="00:14:22.149" style="s2">summed it up so perfectly it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.980" end="00:14:24.579" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got to try and upregulate</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.149" end="00:14:26.259" style="s2">your own signal as best you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.579" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">given that you&#39;ve never really talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.259" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">about this stuff before and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:32.559" style="s2">to be clumsy and you as the listener try</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:36.670" style="s2">not regulate my signal as well right</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.559" end="00:14:38.740" style="s2">IIIi like that I don&#39;t conceive it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.670" end="00:14:40.509" style="s2">quite those terms the up regulation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.740" end="00:14:42.970" style="s2">down regulation but it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.509" end="00:14:53.470" style="s2">actually I&#39;m finding it a more and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.970" end="00:14:56.470" style="s2">useful way of looking at it what was</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.470" end="00:14:58.209" style="s2">coming if we are having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:14:59.589" style="s2">whether there&#39;s multiple of us or one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.209" end="00:15:01.480" style="s2">us we could bring our own selves to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.589" end="00:15:02.920" style="s2">table and we have our own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.480" end="00:15:04.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s rule Omega right that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.920" end="00:15:07.929" style="s2">like trying to find the signal in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.059" end="00:15:09.490" style="s2">noise but starting from a somewhat blank</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.929" end="00:15:15.189" style="s2">state not that the people or blank</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.490" end="00:15:17.529" style="s2">slates state um is that like creating an</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.189" end="00:15:19.209" style="s2">organization creating a product for</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.529" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">creating anything from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.209" end="00:15:24.189" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking for what is the 1% we</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:26.170" style="s2">agree on and what can we build from</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.189" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">there what is the 10% whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.170" end="00:15:30.839" style="s2">percentages that we agree with because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:32.889" style="s2">feel that is a big sticking point for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.839" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">game be moving forward it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.889" end="00:15:35.620" style="s2">everyone has their individual projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:37.959" style="s2">their own individual there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.620" end="00:15:39.850" style="s2">wrong with that but if we can&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.959" end="00:15:42.629" style="s2">start something from the ground up can</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.850" end="00:15:44.559" style="s2">also be already being like what is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.629" end="00:15:46.899" style="s2">don&#39;t there&#39;s something different</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.559" end="00:15:48.249" style="s2">between the group and like where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.899" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">starting on different sides we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.249" end="00:15:52.569" style="s2">to find the commonality versus finding</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:55.269" style="s2">the commonality and then building from</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.569" end="00:15:56.529" style="s2">there um there&#39;s something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.269" end="00:15:58.209" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the game I want to play</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.529" end="00:15:59.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like building it from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.209" end="00:16:02.439" style="s2">it&#39;s like what is the culture what are</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.799" end="00:16:04.779" style="s2">the rules / no rules right like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.439" end="00:16:06.879" style="s2">make a rule is I think submission and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.779" end="00:16:11.080" style="s2">then building it from that point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.879" end="00:16:12.670" style="s2">like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.080" end="00:16:16.230" style="s2">thing we want to create what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.670" end="00:16:19.570" style="s2">process we want to use what is like and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.230" end="00:16:23.460" style="s2">finding building it from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.570" end="00:16:23.460" style="s2">that&#39;s all I wanted to go Sparky</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:29.840" style="s2">I feel like yeah there&#39;s maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.780" end="00:16:33.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if this applies there but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.840" end="00:16:35.370" style="s2">something about how even when people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.410" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">fundamentally coming from different</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.370" end="00:16:42.330" style="s2">points of view and they disagree to to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">little a large extent and there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.330" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">little common signal if they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:52.050" style="s2">the principles of rule Omega they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:54.060" style="s2">still come together around that small</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.050" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2">percentage of signal that they share and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.060" end="00:17:02.640" style="s2">work together because the wave wave rule</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">Omega works it&#39;s almost like the noise</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.640" end="00:17:07.940" style="s2">then just becomes like we accept the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:10.620" style="s2">noise we accept that that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.940" end="00:17:12.930" style="s2">equation and it&#39;s okay for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.620" end="00:17:16.589" style="s2">there and then that allows us to work</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.930" end="00:17:20.070" style="s2">with people who have vastly different</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.589" end="00:17:23.579" style="s2">opinions from our own on things that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.070" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">feel very strongly about because at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.579" end="00:17:28.199" style="s2">end of the day if we can work with</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.040" end="00:17:32.220" style="s2">people like that and they can work with</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.199" end="00:17:36.780" style="s2">us then we can avoid a lot of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.220" end="00:17:38.280" style="s2">so yeah I don&#39;t know if that that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.780" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">strikes a chord with anything you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.280" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">saying or not something that came up for</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:44.100" style="s2">me while Jubilee was talking was</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">something that came up in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.100" end="00:17:49.010" style="s2">I had with Roland us awhile ago he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:51.900" style="s2">really into nonviolent communication and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.010" end="00:17:53.400" style="s2">he is of the opinion and I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.900" end="00:17:55.050" style="s2">it makes a great deal of sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.400" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">he&#39;s of the opinion that almost all</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.050" end="00:18:01.350" style="s2">conflicts can be resolved if you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:03.720" style="s2">successfully separate needs from</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.350" end="00:18:06.210" style="s2">strategies that almost all conflicts are</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.720" end="00:18:08.190" style="s2">over strategies right how to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.210" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">a given need but actually when you come</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.190" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">right down to it the needs that we both</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.990" end="00:18:15.030" style="s2">have here are very clear and can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:16.530" style="s2">agreed upon right without without really</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.030" end="00:18:19.380" style="s2">any dispute at all it&#39;s how you go about</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.530" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">meeting those needs that is the dispute</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.380" end="00:18:23.910" style="s2">and so if you can start from that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">of I acknowledge your needs you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.910" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">acknowledge my needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.930" end="00:18:29.430" style="s2">we both accept that it just it just it</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">just starts the space from which you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.430" end="00:18:34.010" style="s2">maybe build strategies that aren&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:34.010" style="s2">conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.410" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">yeah which is maybe also a great a great</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.679" end="00:18:43.330" style="s2">point around the fact that rule Omega is</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:47.590" style="s2">one tool and there are many many tools</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.330" end="00:18:50.860" style="s2">in this area and the more that we can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.590" end="00:18:58.929" style="s2">aware of them and apply them the easier</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.860" end="00:19:04.140" style="s2">this whole process becomes think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.929" end="00:19:10.660" style="s2">the relationship there between and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.140" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">signal it&#39;s like a radio channel or</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.660" end="00:19:16.030" style="s2">radio frequency that we&#39;re all probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:20.020" style="s2">pretty good and quicker to get tuning</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.030" end="00:19:21.370" style="s2">into because it&#39;s something that we we</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.020" end="00:19:23.350" style="s2">all sort of have in common it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.370" end="00:19:26.230" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost like a language you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.350" end="00:19:29.290" style="s2">know I mean estate we have like shared</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.230" end="00:19:30.940" style="s2">vocabulary then it&#39;s much easier to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:32.679" style="s2">know it&#39;s much easier do things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.940" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">achieve coherence it&#39;s much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.679" end="00:19:37.750" style="s2">pick out the signal and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:40.780" style="s2">with something like like needs as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.750" end="00:19:42.429" style="s2">because there&#39;s hope you know or at</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.780" end="00:19:46.270" style="s2">least some of them are so common to all</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.429" end="00:19:48.429" style="s2">of us it also probably makes it easier</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.270" end="00:19:50.980" style="s2">to pick out pick out that signal so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.429" end="00:19:54.280" style="s2">we focus on that and then kind of build</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.980" end="00:19:56.170" style="s2">around with rather than starting with</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.280" end="00:19:59.380" style="s2">the concept that nobody knows I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.170" end="00:20:00.940" style="s2">to build up a signal based on that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.380" end="00:20:02.290" style="s2">probably difficult whereas if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.940" end="00:20:04.929" style="s2">starting with something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.290" end="00:20:08.890" style="s2">acknowledge easily and then build out</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.929" end="00:20:11.020" style="s2">from there yeah that might just it might</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.890" end="00:20:12.750" style="s2">be easier anyone just occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.020" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">when I was listening to you there during</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.750" end="00:20:18.550" style="s2">nonviolent communication yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">explained the concepts start at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.550" end="00:20:24.190" style="s2">starting point of the explanation of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:26.590" style="s2">concept is identifying the needs that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.190" end="00:20:29.110" style="s2">is purporting to meet right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.590" end="00:20:30.910" style="s2">grounds it in in something of substance</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.110" end="00:20:32.890" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a real thing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:35.020" style="s2">meeting a need which we can all identify</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.890" end="00:20:38.340" style="s2">with because these needs are as you say</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.500" end="00:23:22.309" style="s2">it and be like oh yeah that one actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.909" end="00:23:24.260" style="s2">is born so I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.260" end="00:23:29.870" style="s2">it comes so easily to us we assume that</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.870" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">any like we all like needs are so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.429" end="00:23:35.990" style="s2">universal like there&#39;s days I forgot to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:38.270" style="s2">eat or drink water like that level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.990" end="00:23:40.789" style="s2">not realizing in my own basic meet so</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.270" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">for debt if I need is connection and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.250" end="00:23:50.360" style="s2">more self-aware because I know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.710" end="00:23:52.520" style="s2">about myself and I&#39;ve been seeking out</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.360" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">how to figure that out then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.520" end="00:23:56.929" style="s2">people who are in the same boat they</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">don&#39;t like that&#39;s not a good assumption</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.929" end="00:24:01.159" style="s2">that we make it that&#39;s broad that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.539" style="s2">everyone has that I&#39;m especially maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.159" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">in the game B&#39;s face because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.539" end="00:24:07.549" style="s2">intellectual a lot even though we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:09.470" style="s2">also doing the Leichhardt face piece of</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.010" end="00:24:17.330" style="s2">like we need people like you who that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.260" end="00:24:20.450" style="s2">easy for to maybe help the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.330" end="00:24:23.539" style="s2">who it&#39;s less easy for I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.450" end="00:24:25.100" style="s2">that looks like but I&#39;d like yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.539" end="00:24:28.070" style="s2">going to do a lot of regulation down</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.100" end="00:24:29.750" style="s2">regulation there so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.070" end="00:24:31.730" style="s2">Jubilee I hear you absolutely on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">specifics that we may not know what our</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.730" end="00:24:37.370" style="s2">own needs actually are like the specific</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">ones and we may not recognize someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.370" end="00:24:43.909" style="s2">else&#39;s specific needs either so what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:47.150" style="s2">was actually thinking about more was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.909" end="00:24:50.600" style="s2">the more meta thing of that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.150" end="00:24:54.620" style="s2">needs mm-hmm I mean and that they that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.600" end="00:24:58.190" style="s2">they exist that and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.620" end="00:24:59.809" style="s2">something that we can relate to so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.190" end="00:25:04.039" style="s2">basically it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.809" end="00:25:05.240" style="s2">grounding and the that sort of that core</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.039" end="00:25:06.710" style="s2">thing of going yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.240" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">you know we do actually all need to eat</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.710" end="00:25:10.309" style="s2">we do actually all need to sleep you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:11.809" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of that thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.309" end="00:25:13.580" style="s2">even if you&#39;re not good at it in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.809" end="00:25:15.530" style="s2">moment or in a you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.580" end="00:25:16.850" style="s2">specifically you know like you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.530" end="00:25:18.230" style="s2">forget to eat or someone else might</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.850" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">forget to sleep or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:24.919" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s still maybe that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:26.330" style="s2">strategies right that&#39;s bad strategies</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.919" end="00:25:28.490" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing to do with the needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.330" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">that&#39;s executing bad strategies to meet</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.490" end="00:25:33.500" style="s2">the needs you know it&#39;s again really</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:35.000" style="s2">important to keep these things separate</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.500" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">from each other you not eating when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.000" end="00:25:40.370" style="s2">were hungry that&#39;s bad strategizing not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing to do with the need that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.370" end="00:25:46.340" style="s2">make sense actually I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.970" end="00:25:48.710" style="s2">Eric she&#39;ll expand on that what you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.340" end="00:25:52.429" style="s2">confusion of strategy with needs so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.710" end="00:25:53.480" style="s2">would be a good point oh god alright I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.429" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">me think if I can come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.480" end="00:26:01.850" style="s2">example real quick all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:03.710" style="s2">say that okay so yeah the there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.850" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">river and there&#39;s two towns either side</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.710" end="00:26:06.679" style="s2">of the river and you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:10.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a river between them is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.679" end="00:26:11.270" style="s2">problem and so they all get together and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.100" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">they decide that they need a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.270" end="00:26:14.630" style="s2">right to connect the two towns and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">argue about what kind of bridge is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.630" end="00:26:18.710" style="s2">to be blah blah blah blah blah so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:20.809" style="s2">argument is being sent around a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.710" end="00:26:23.299" style="s2">because the bridge is a strategy the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.809" end="00:26:26.029" style="s2">need is to connect the two towns</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.299" end="00:26:27.259" style="s2">strategy to do so is the bridge but why</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.029" end="00:26:28.249" style="s2">they&#39;re arguing that what kind of bridge</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.259" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">to built they haven&#39;t even considered</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.249" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">the possibility of a tunnel for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:34.789" style="s2">or an airport or a heliport or a ferry</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.919" style="s2">or whatever you know what I mean so this</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.789" end="00:26:39.289" style="s2">is what I mean about getting confused</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.919" end="00:26:41.929" style="s2">between strategies and needs now if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.289" end="00:26:43.429" style="s2">keep the need clear at the outset you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.929" end="00:26:45.049" style="s2">know the bridge has become the need but</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.429" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">actually not it&#39;s not the need the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.049" end="00:26:47.899" style="s2">bridge is the strategy the need is to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:51.139" style="s2">connect the Townsend so if you kept the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.899" end="00:26:53.330" style="s2">need clear all the way through and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.139" end="00:26:55.759" style="s2">possibility for other other strategies</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.330" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">to meet that need could emerge this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.759" end="00:26:59.480" style="s2">the difficulty of getting confused</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.190" style="s2">between strategies and needs the need</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.480" end="00:27:04.999" style="s2">becomes sorry the strategy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.190" end="00:27:06.019" style="s2">confused with the need right and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.999" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">you&#39;re meeting the strategy you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.019" end="00:27:12.669" style="s2">meeting the need you&#39;re meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">strategy that&#39;s really clear thank you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.669" end="00:27:17.090" style="s2">this actually brings to mind something</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:21.590" style="s2">else that might be relevant here which</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.090" end="00:27:27.460" style="s2">is from a Buddhist perspective looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.590" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">at being able to separate sort of who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.460" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">who someone is in in how they present to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.850" end="00:27:43.129" style="s2">the world or their I want to say surface</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">but but their their self and who someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.129" end="00:27:50.509" style="s2">is sort of at a at a deeper essential</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.970" style="s2">level beneath that and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.509" end="00:27:57.409" style="s2">recognize that that those are separate</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.970" end="00:28:00.710" style="s2">things and that we all we all we all</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.409" end="00:28:05.359" style="s2">bring something that is the same that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.710" end="00:28:08.239" style="s2">has needs to any conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.359" end="00:28:10.279" style="s2">all all the stuff we stack on top of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.239" end="00:28:12.859" style="s2">that that&#39;s different in all of us is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.279" end="00:28:15.559" style="s2">just that it&#39;s just stacked on top like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.859" end="00:28:16.999" style="s2">the strategy it&#39;s and when we conflate</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.559" end="00:28:18.440" style="s2">the two just like with needs and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.999" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">strategies that&#39;s when we run into</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.440" end="00:28:23.720" style="s2">trouble because then we think that all</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.080" end="00:28:26.359" style="s2">these surface things that we see are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.720" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">person when in fact that that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.359" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">they are at all it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:33.210" style="s2">came up when you starts like what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:34.740" style="s2">appearance was was signal the noise and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.210" end="00:28:36.570" style="s2">that as well right when you meet someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.740" end="00:28:38.520" style="s2">in their like tattoos and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.570" end="00:28:40.590" style="s2">certain and you put or you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.520" end="00:28:42.210" style="s2">race gender anything where you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.590" end="00:28:44.040" style="s2">have bias and stuff that&#39;s put on them</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.210" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">and to find that like the truth the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.040" end="00:28:49.080" style="s2">signal that is who they are is almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:51.810" style="s2">even more important than the signal in</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.080" end="00:28:53.880" style="s2">the conversation right like my humanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.810" end="00:28:56.190" style="s2">sees the humanity in you whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.880" end="00:28:58.740" style="s2">you know looks like you come off of an</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.190" end="00:29:00.690" style="s2">Amish place or you look like you you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.740" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">know our sex worker it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.690" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like humanity there there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:09.210" style="s2">essence and the needs that are mmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.210" end="00:29:15.810" style="s2">only on that signal and noise thing as</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.260" end="00:29:18.570" style="s2">well so one of the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.810" end="00:29:20.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve done in terms of like getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.570" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">myself trained in various things is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.130" end="00:29:25.260" style="s2">an image consultant and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.590" style="s2">the things that we sort of think about a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.260" end="00:29:30.750" style="s2">lot as well as is congruence between</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.590" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">what is sort of what is the essence of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.750" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">person and then the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">present because as much as we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.730" end="00:29:42.840" style="s2">to we do all you not quickly start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:45.660" style="s2">form judgments of people not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.840" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">is it good or bad but in what we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.660" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">what we feel that we can expect from</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:53.130" style="s2">them so we used stereotypes and it that</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:56.790" style="s2">was actually a huge learning for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.130" end="00:29:58.950" style="s2">because um I&#39;d like to generally think</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.790" end="00:30:00.330" style="s2">that I don&#39;t do that with people like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.950" end="00:30:02.580" style="s2">don&#39;t judge them based on how they look</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.330" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">and we did this exercise there was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.580" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">there was a bunch of us and we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:08.670" style="s2">different photos and we had to just you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">know write down our thoughts about you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.670" end="00:30:12.780" style="s2">know what how old is this person how</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">many kids do they have what kind of car</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.780" end="00:30:16.680" style="s2">do they drive what&#39;s their job and so on</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:18.150" style="s2">and so forth so you know it&#39;s so we all</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.680" end="00:30:20.460" style="s2">wrote these things down as best we could</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.150" end="00:30:23.640" style="s2">and then you know I from completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.460" end="00:30:27.270" style="s2">different cultures results that we got</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.640" end="00:30:29.070" style="s2">were almost exactly the same though we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.270" end="00:30:33.240" style="s2">were all making exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.070" end="00:30:35.820" style="s2">judgments based on just a photo of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.240" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">somebody so but yes that&#39;s that same</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.820" end="00:30:40.050" style="s2">kind of thing it&#39;s like you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">intentionally or unintentionally create</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.050" end="00:30:43.710" style="s2">noise in your appearance so you know so</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.289" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.710" end="00:30:49.230" style="s2">you know I put some tattoos or you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.289" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">does the pink hair or the you know any</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.230" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">of those kinds of things it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:56.490" style="s2">expressing something and then it then</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:30:58.649" style="s2">you have to work out underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:00.270" style="s2">like what is the you know what is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.649" end="00:31:02.250" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.270" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">what is the you know what&#39;s the true</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.250" end="00:31:08.100" style="s2">signal and what&#39;s what&#39;s noise again and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:10.140" style="s2">I get something yeah is that noise is</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.100" end="00:31:12.090" style="s2">almost like the lack of congruence and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.140" end="00:31:13.830" style="s2">that you know in that first instance</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.090" end="00:31:15.899" style="s2">it&#39;s you know and it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.830" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">compute you know when it&#39;s not what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.899" end="00:31:24.299" style="s2">expect then yeah and I was like the say</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:26.669" style="s2">because I a very consciously spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.299" end="00:31:28.500" style="s2">of my life trying to conform and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.669" end="00:31:30.450" style="s2">like I never quite got there like I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.500" end="00:31:32.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how to fit in at work or</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.450" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">school or that kind of thing once I gave</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.610" end="00:31:36.029" style="s2">it up once I&#39;m like in a giant onesie</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:36.870" style="s2">I&#39;m like a banal I can wear what I want</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.029" end="00:31:40.440" style="s2">to where I want to where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.870" end="00:31:42.270" style="s2">comfortable I put off a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.440" end="00:31:43.770" style="s2">right like I&#39;m like I&#39;m always that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.270" end="00:31:45.539" style="s2">okay I&#39;m good with that I don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">you have to get to know me to know who I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.539" end="00:31:49.260" style="s2">am I&#39;m not gonna like necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:53.700" style="s2">presence on the outside although a giant</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.260" end="00:31:55.770" style="s2">elephant onesie is funny how it is but</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.700" end="00:31:57.390" style="s2">like because I don&#39;t know like I want an</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.770" end="00:31:59.730" style="s2">authentic world I want people to dress</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.390" end="00:32:02.279" style="s2">and be who they are whether that is real</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.730" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">or not signal or noise but this like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.279" end="00:32:05.159" style="s2">was like the Trump thing I talked to her</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.390" style="s2">earlier it&#39;s like when people over us</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.159" end="00:32:09.809" style="s2">it&#39;s like a wear a suit or no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.390" end="00:32:12.090" style="s2">gonna take you seriously it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.809" end="00:32:13.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve collectively decided that and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.090" end="00:32:15.809" style="s2">can see the people in suits aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.679" end="00:32:18.360" style="s2">really more respectable so like at what</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.809" end="00:32:20.490" style="s2">point do we let go of that bias maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.360" end="00:32:22.679" style="s2">never maybe I do just have to open that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.490" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">I need to be more more business but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.679" end="00:32:25.740" style="s2">don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.929" style="s2">and then like sexism and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.740" end="00:32:29.850" style="s2">comes into it like men can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.929" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">billionaires in our t-shirt and jeans</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.850" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">and women are expected to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">care about fashion and I just never</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:38.220" style="s2">never have but anyway I&#39;m gonna stay</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">with that for like the signal I want the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.220" end="00:32:43.260" style="s2">signal from my noise and communication I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:44.789" style="s2">want that to get better whereas I kinda</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.260" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">just want my appearance to get more and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.789" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">more and more and more noisy for like my</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.840" style="s2">own internal signal right of like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:32:55.800" style="s2">is what I want to wear because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:32:58.350" style="s2">wear it not</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.800" end="00:33:00.420" style="s2">because it puts on a certain thing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.350" end="00:33:02.040" style="s2">other people that is their true essence</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.420" end="00:33:04.230" style="s2">as well like they&#39;re like yes and I want</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.040" end="00:33:07.230" style="s2">to look good cool awesome go as</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:11.460" style="s2">fashionistas you want just not expecting</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.230" end="00:33:13.650" style="s2">it from from like everyone else so in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.460" end="00:33:18.450" style="s2">way there would be zero noise in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.650" end="00:33:21.210" style="s2">appearance from you but there might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.450" end="00:33:24.450" style="s2">noise in other people reacting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.210" end="00:33:25.920" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.450" end="00:33:27.750" style="s2">entirely unavoidable right I mean</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:37.290" style="s2">different people I I hear what you said</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.790" end="00:33:39.000" style="s2">before Carly but nevertheless there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.290" end="00:33:41.550" style="s2">going to be some variation but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.000" end="00:33:44.490" style="s2">for example Jubilee associate suits with</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.550" end="00:33:46.290" style="s2">you know being shady and corrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.490" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">know what I mean at least as much those</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.290" end="00:33:49.260" style="s2">people that don&#39;t wear suits so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:55.050" style="s2">they will have different associations</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.260" end="00:33:56.700" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever I mean</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.380" end="00:34:04.890" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s a forlorn thought I</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.000" end="00:34:12.870" style="s2">much attention to those judgements and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.530" end="00:34:14.280" style="s2">not put any stock in them I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.870" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">the best we can do I don&#39;t think we can</p>
