<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">six hidden patterns of history</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">so it&#39;s a book on world history</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">particularly on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">meta memes the great connecting patterns</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily periods in history</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">but can help us analyze how history has</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">developed and evolved</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">right so how far are you it depends</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">on how you mean by far so especially my</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">co-author emil has been putting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">work into this he&#39;s the historian</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">but we&#39;ve fairly recently redefined</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">how we want to read write the book and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">dialogue format namely</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">the queue and ajf fry night so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">um actually we&#39;re a little bit starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">um but it&#39;s been a lot of fun thus far</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">right okay so uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">what do you want to talk about so today</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">a very a number of very very important</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:18.280" style="s2">about what people</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">mean when they use the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.280" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">people mean very very different things</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">and metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">i feel in many ways is crippled for this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">particular reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re well chasing our own tail a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">lot of the time and don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">right so hopefully this lecture will</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">help to bring some specificity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">clarity into that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the aim perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">lecture is based on a chapter that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">coming up in a meta-modern reader it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">going to be called something else they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">changed the title several times</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">but there are chapters by a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">prominent scholars of the field</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">and uh there is going to be one by hanse</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">frynart</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">which is titled metamodern sociology</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">and in that chapter there is also a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">definition of the term</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">metamodernism or some distinctions to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">this definition so that&#39;s where this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">right perfect okay so for your listeners</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">how that works</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">uh daniel will do like i don&#39;t know 30</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">lecture is that more or less what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re aiming for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">we will chat a little bit about this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">then we&#39;ll open the floor for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">participants and i will make them active</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">participants so they can turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">and uh ask their questions and go into</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">dialogue with you and i i hope that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">would be a lively and interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">so i make you now the co-host so you go</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">because you have some slides and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">want to um</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">is that right yes that&#39;s correct okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">okay now</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">now you&#39;re the host and you can go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">sharing screen</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">this one um</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">slideshow from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">what is meta-modernism learning to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">important distinctions and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">uh to stress that these are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">important distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">that i&#39;m not just shuffling around</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">words here that where um</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">we have this vast</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">movement of interconnected things some</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">of which</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">are call themselves metamodern and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">others that don&#39;t at all or don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">know about the term</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">but they are somehow connected so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll dive into this and give a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">different definitions</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">of what metamodernism is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">so first the first one</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">is to claim it&#39;s a cultural phase</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">so uh post-modernism has been around in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">society i should mention by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">um this lecture is a little bit less</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">introductory</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">than our former discussions have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">tom so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">so this is for a somewhat more uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">um well advanced audience who might</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">already know</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">a bit about about the topic or have some</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">preconceptions</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">um and the first is that it&#39;s a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">phase</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">so uh there has been um</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">um well a lot of ink has been spilled</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">around this topic of post-modernism the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">ironic detachment from modern society</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.550" style="s2">the deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">of its meaning structures the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.550" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">the critical gaze of humanities and</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">is something different than just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">cultural face</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">it corresponds more to modernity not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">modernism as an</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">arts an arts period and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">post-modernist that&#39;s another arts</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">but more like modernity going back</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">even to the uh to the renaissance up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">the industrial revolution up to liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">and fully blooming in liberal democracy</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">that that is modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">post-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">is the kind of society that comes after</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">capitalist liberal democracy</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot more to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">i should go on</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">but that&#39;s an enormously important</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">distinction to be made</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">and it causes a lot of confusions</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">especially for the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">who subscribe to this first view</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">and they hear a lot of people such as</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">myself talking about a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">whole new society and they feel well</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re beating a much too big</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">drum but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">we are actually i think there are good</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">reasons to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">society is shifting in such profound</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">and uh wide-reaching manners that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">um that we can indeed and should indeed</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">thinking about um what this new stage of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">society looks like</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">and this is both an exploratory work</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">explore what this new stage could look</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a normative work meaning or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">prescriptive work because</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">there&#39;s a logic to how the stage stages</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">so it says something about what the new</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">stage should look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">more on this perhaps later</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">no it&#39;s a meta meme says the third voice</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">and the third voice says</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">something quite similar to it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">stage in society but</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">a bit more abstract or a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">abstracted</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not the particular society that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">first society is modern then it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">post-modern then it becomes meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">rather there have been throughout</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">large sets of memes of interconnected</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">and these we can call meta memes and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">have an inherent logic that connect the</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">events and processes in them</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">and each of these are a kind of jet</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">cultural generator function</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">which asserts itself first within</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">uh in comes modernism which says well if</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">all equal we should all be able to check</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">what happens is of course that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">you have a scientific revolution and all</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">that follows from it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">and post-modernism is the critique of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">modern society picks that apart</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">shows that the power structures are</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">and and yeah there&#39;s a whole thread</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">there and meta-modernism comes in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">as a pattern that emerges from the</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">and starts to reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">modernism and post-modernism but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">including elements of all of the former</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">meta memes so these are abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">so looking at modernism for instance you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">can&#39;t pin it down to one particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">or one particular period because</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">modernism as um as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">meta meme begins in the arts so it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">begins</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">in in renaissance art</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">and when you get things like uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">in the in the italian renaissance for</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">instance you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">perspective and like that the natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">is detached from the social universe</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:49.679" style="s2">so uh from that very move</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">to view the world objectively to view it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.679" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">so in a way so that anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">can check for themselves from a third</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">person view of you from</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">nowhere as it were um</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">then all of the other modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">institutions follow through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">development of a capitalist economy and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">a socialist alternative to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">to uh to the development</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">of uh liberal democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">and full of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">full suffrage and so on um</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">and and human rights and a liberal world</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s the same metamine</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s not stretched over a very short</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">period it&#39;s over 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">and in the midst of that of the growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">of the former metameme at the very top</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">of modernity you have the birth</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">of a postmodern critique starting also</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">first in the arts</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">long before you had philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">post-modern philosophers like foucault</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">you had</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">art that could in this sense be deemed</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">because it critiques perspective for</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">instance and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">when when picasso us so very</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">very um consciously for instance</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">well so so what the theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">can be mentioned that has done re</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">similar work</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">uh before and viewed the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">similarly to these uh meta memes would</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">be jean gibson&#39;s looking for these</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">deep patterns that underlie</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">history and organize it and he also</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">notices that there are different</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">there are different logics that</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">and there is a clear sequence to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">so also here comparing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">viewing metamodernism as a face in our</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">well then there&#39;s um</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">fourth answer to the question what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s a rare</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">and that the idea here is that people</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">as human beings and our values in our</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">modern first and get a modern world view</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">maybe when you were in high school you</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">many other things and i modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">connect to such things as meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">achievement fear and free competition</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">for instance</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">and on it goes that after the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">modern stage of development you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">see something</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">like a post-modern stage of development</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:56.360" style="s2">or something that would correspond to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">where you can take many different</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">you view yourself more as a relational</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">you value relationships more</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">you question the the values of your</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">and whether or not it&#39;s a fair and free</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">and metamodernism would be the subject</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">section of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">often fairly privileged and educated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">people who become post-modernists</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">who takes up a more self-developmental</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">one becomes more concerned with</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">like i help you develop so that you can</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">begin to focus on processes and um</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">and how much more how</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">and when than than the actual what</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">so so there is a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">sequence of developmental stages and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">different sequences</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">this simplified model</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">that i have presented which builds a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">looks a bit more of a caricature image</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">of these stages</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">but there is a rich plethora of research</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">and they seem to be pointing in the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.559" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">that later stages are more nuanced more</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.559" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">multi-perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">and less identified with the self and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">metamodern then in this sense a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">people will talk about is this person</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">meta-modern is that person meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">maybe a while ago it was more popular</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">say somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">post-modern or they are integral in</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">or their modernist or postmodernist or</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">integral in their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">and nowadays a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">shifted that word integral</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">in in terms of a psychological stage</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">to uh to metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">or to metamodern so this person is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">meta-modern in their perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">people who recognize each other as being</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">stage will try to find each other and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">interact because they find</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">they have much more in common for</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s a fourth definition of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">meta-modernism a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">stage of development and a fairly fair</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">one a rare one as i said</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">so likely under a percent of the</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.220" style="s2">stringent in the</p>

<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">no it&#39;s a certain paradigm</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">well so this is important</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">that a lot of people when they say</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">metamodern actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">the philosophical engine that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">be connected to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">meta meme to uh to this cultural shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">and so on and there are interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">shifts that have happened in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">lately</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">uh i try to grab six of them here</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">and highlight them but they&#39;re by no</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">means the the only possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">compilation but there is something</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:45.590" style="s2">like a profound shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">of world view</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.590" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:51.050" style="s2">which afflicts certain people</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">and then they uh</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">they changed their view of life reality</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">and society in</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">in abstract but profound way</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">well basically your philosophy of life</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">shifts and your</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">your basic philosophical prop uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">prepositions shift so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">a fifth one so what are these</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">well what are these elements as i said</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">six suggestions here and they should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">viewed as interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">so the first is complexity a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">meta-modern perspectives come close live</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">close to complexity science and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">to studies of octopuses</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">of self-organization in nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">of um and the interaction of uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">many many loose agents who together</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">create patterns which are unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">emerge in other</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">there is a view that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">unlike more post-modern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t view the world necessarily in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">terms of structures and power structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">rather you tend to view them as</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">different complex interactions</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">which have um which have</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">often unexpected consequences</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">and both desirable and undesirable so</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s also it also points towards a less</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">black and white</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">kind of kind of view of the world which</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">also makes it more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">from this philosophical perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">take a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">position on the classical political</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">scale etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">going on from there we have a second</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">element perspectivalism or perspectivism</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">um which basically says that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">well whoever has the most perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">when they die wins</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">that um in meta modern philosophy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">in the metamodel</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">paradigm uh always tries to climb out</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">of whatever perspectives i happen to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">have at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">and view the world with other</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">perspectives the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">of people with other paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">and other world views the people the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">perspectives of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">other ethnicities other social groups</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">other sciences other disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">and these together create</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">these together create um a rich</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">plethora of perspectives which are</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">not arbitrarily ordered because you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">of the perspectives so you see them</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">more as emergent properties and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">interaction with each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">and the the issue with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">philosophy often becomes to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">emergence where we get to the third one</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">the emergence and processes</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">that lead up to these perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">no perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">entirely wrong there&#39;s always a reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">that somebody thinks something even</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">uh like even a schizophrenic nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">or a conspiracy theory or anything else</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">there&#39;s always something to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">always a partial truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">well you get to a deeper truth then</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">by comparing as many perspectives as</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">possible and getting the best</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">possible meta theory or meta perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">but through which we can compare them</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">we&#39;re always building this medic</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">a third one uh no the third one was</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">emergence and processing so</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">this of course builds us</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">behooves us to always want to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">the best possible processes for truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">seeking for sense making and so on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">so you can recognize metamodern</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">philosophy and this that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">it will look for not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">a stable truth it views the world as</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">full of flows and always always</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">events always occurrences uh always</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">uh in flux and for this reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">it tries to understand and see</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">how these processes and flows can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">reorganized and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">and resonate better together in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">greater wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">so to speak developmental stages then</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">yes um i mean some people would</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">would argue against me here that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">one has to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">the modern philosophy and i guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">true of all of them that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">among men and modern thinkers or people</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">are part of this paradigm in one way or</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">that uh you&#39;ll find maybe 70</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">um like them and 30 don&#39;t for often for</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">very good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">so the the reasons not to like ideas</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">about developmental stages is of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">lead to judgmental stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">think of yourself as a higher stage than</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">they can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">closing down on truly taking</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">multiple perspectives and they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">you can also uh misalign this</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">or or misconstrue the stages and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">can lead to catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">for instance if you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">capitalist society inevitably collapses</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">into a socialist one through a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">revolution you&#39;ve made a false</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">stage theory and um and if you act</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">according to that stage theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:55.599" style="s2">uh then bad consequences will come out</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">so you&#39;ll also raise the stakes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">when you try to uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">to implement developmental perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">but the counter argument to that is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:09.240" style="s2">um well if we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">accept them post modern multiple</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.240" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">spectivalism</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">and a critique of any uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">one great truth out there then</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">we have already introduced a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">stage theory we&#39;re already saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">that the postmodern critique</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">stems from modernity and modernism</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">and that in a sense that it is a higher</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">so it is actually less arrogant to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">argue that there are several stages and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">that there were several stages before</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">modernity and that there will be later</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">stages</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">which will shred whatever philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">is being born at this in this day and</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">and that a lot of people won&#39;t be able</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">and that there will be clashes of</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">um so if we do view the world</p>

<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">there&#39;s not that much left of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">um of the self so when we look</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">inwards with this kind of philosophy we</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">see there is no</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">and so there is no clear boundary</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">and me we still have to set up such</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">uh for for the sake of social um</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">i still have my body and you have yours</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">but in terms of ideas and interactions</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">and actions and agency</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">and life courses we develop together</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">and we are multi um</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">we are multi-layered each of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">so you can it can affect me by means</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">of i don&#39;t know a smart uh</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">and so my agency can come from you and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">at the same time i can find another way</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">to manipulate you or we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">we can bust each other&#39;s shadows or we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">bring each other into into higher</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">spiritual states and whatnot the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">that we&#39;ve dissolved the eye we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">and we evolved together</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">and this brings us actually um to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">philosophical prepositions on fractality</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">that meta-modern philosophy or the</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.839" style="s2">closely relates to fractals in many ways</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.839" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">um when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">zoom in on anything you tend to not</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">find an essence use it zoom in on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">left and the right for instance</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">in politics while there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">left and the right within the left and</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">and if you examine these</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">parts closely you&#39;re going to notice</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">that the left</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">within the right often has a lot more in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">common with the left</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">with the with the left of the left than</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">with the right to the right and so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be so many connections</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">that you can&#39;t place on a simple scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">like the uh like the two-dimensional</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">of uh galton for instance</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">those little maps of ideological</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">rather there it&#39;s full of loopholes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s full of the world doesn&#39;t consist</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">of flat planes it consists of doughnuts</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">you zoom in on one thing and you notice</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">some underlying pattern for instance a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">meta meme</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">and you zoom in on it new self-similar</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">things emerge</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">but they emerge in new ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">and this goes throughout all of the</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">talked about so fractality applies to</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">uh to perspective to perspectivism</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">you find perspectives within</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">and so on so we are opening up this</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">uh yes uh i i think i can go for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">moment more</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">so um here we go uh</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">so metamodernism is also something</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">this is also what people mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">when they say the term metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">and there there is a connecting thread</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">throughout all of these different</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">it always ends on a question mark it</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.280" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">always asks for the questions</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">this was also what was deliberately said</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">um what what was uh literally said by</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">by foucault who once he had been</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">critiquing everything and uh once he was</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">well you&#39;re just against everything what</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">do you want</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">and he said you know what there are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">many engineers</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">and economists in the world who are busy</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">i just want to pick it apart and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">kind of encapsulates</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">the the core essence no we don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">in essences after post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">but a core principle of uh of the</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">and also of the post-modern sentiment</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">um a kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">after all are probably mistaken and yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">we have to try because hey we&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s this playful element so</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to list a few different</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">which i feel are connected through this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:23.119" style="s2">common thread and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">post-modern in a sense then well one</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">thing is of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">uh the book the listening society</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">by hanse frynacht um</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">which tries to reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">the welfare state and say hey we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">construct a new layer</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">of uh of politics and a new form of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">politics we could look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">other and deeper issues of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">to grow as a human being for instance</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">um maybe emphasizing things like</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:12.290" style="s2">top political concerns</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">in many ways post-capitalism</p>

<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">because what many meta-modern i mean</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">or like a grim power structure</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">mentioned that also in the first one</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">and we talked about the arts um but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">many many different aesthetic</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">which is nevertheless playful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">ironically helped</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">which is at the crossroads of fact of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:40.920" style="s2">fiction another</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">another meta-modern slogan</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.920" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">co-development so you have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">gathering um around europe and the us</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">and many other places i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">who experiment with new ways of meeting</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:04.319" style="s2">and um seeing what emerges in the room</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">to put ego issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">and preconceptions to decide and try to</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">something interesting to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">in the interaction itself so that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">interaction also becomes</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">transformational for the person</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">who participates</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">so this is a very important theme i</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">suppose in all of these movements</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">co-development you&#39;ll find it in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">artistic expressions in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">post-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">and commoning projects</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">in the listening society of course and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of politics</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">and you also have different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">secular</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">secularized religion and democratized</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">so religion and spirituality uh which</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">kind of were thrown out with the baby as</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">a baby with bath water</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">and under modernity and never truly</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">fully</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">reconquered under a post-modern critique</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">thereof even though we have plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">post-modern buddhists and so on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">um there</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">there is an attempt to um</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">there is an attempt to re-um</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">to recreate these things create new</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">rituals new co-created rituals</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">to um to create an embodied sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">of what metamodernism means in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">not necessarily without using that term</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">but this is an important element as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">yeah there are many examples for</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">cynthia&#39;s as a movement creating god</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">um so you have all of those things going</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">on that&#39;s also kind of reconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">follows deconstruction we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">criticized</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">the modern society now we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">the the organizations within which we</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">um oftentimes it&#39;s a marriage then of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">the personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">the political and the professional and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">these are reintegrated in new ways they</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">were differentiated under modernity</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">and now they are reintegrated it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">a risky business</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">and then i should mention that these</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">movements tend to stem from the triple h</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">hipsters hackers and hippies so hipsters</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">are rich on cultural capital um</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">they&#39;re really the embodiment of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">creative class</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re also rich on understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">well maybe maybe a lot of book learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">and find ways of using these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">transformationally</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">in in the world but they hook up</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">increasingly with hackers</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">i am no exception there i&#39;m at hipster i</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">guess you could say in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">denomination and i work with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">community in silicon valley at something</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">called the one project</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">uh who are experts at building software</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">and i work</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">formerly also at a and a nike company as</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">and then you have the hippies of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">people who are good at meditation</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">and all the somatic therapies and so on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">and this shows up a lot also psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">practices of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">this shows up a lot in in</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">burning man culture which is also</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">naturally connected to the arts</p>

<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">hackers so these are important</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.599" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">when you put these three together you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">kind of have the nexus of where all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">all of these movement things are</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">occurring and emerging and where for</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">instance the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">modern philosophy is or different forms</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">modern philosophy are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">take hold</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">and you might add a fourth fourth age</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">so you can expand it to from triple a to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">quadruple age population to hermetics so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">the hermetics are people who are very</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">interested in symbols</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">and the occult and in games often and in</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">they&#39;re good at inventing these and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">provide a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">temple building which is uh instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.839" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">in many ways for for the others to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">gather and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">and work together not least if</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">we are to create new religion and</p>

<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">so that kind of exciting capital</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">encapsulates</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">where we&#39;re at as a metamodernist</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">and on the surface it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">a movement because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">it&#39;s so widespread and it just points in</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">but on the other hand if you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">more closely you see</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">yes reconstruction follows</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">deconstruction these people tend to like</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">yes it is a movement just doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">like movements</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">usually have done historically it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">more complex movement but their</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">metamodernism is also a movement and</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">another distinction that should be made</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">and not be confused with</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">it is what schwann sean has bjorn</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">meaning that you imagine a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">we should view it as the sum of all of</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">then we can nimbly go back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">between these six</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">come up that are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">nevertheless we should integrate these</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">meanings and we should</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">uh work across them and back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">let them uh cross pollinate and so on</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">but we shouldn&#39;t be stuck in one meaning</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">and we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">fight the other meanings that&#39;s uh i</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">guess my main argument and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">most of all we shouldn&#39;t confuse these</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">meanings on one another then we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">and the time of one another um</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">i could end there i&#39;ll say two more a</p>

<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to see that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">something is meta-modern in one or two</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">of these</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">of them so for instance you can have a</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">you can have a political leader like</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">could have made and the value means</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">visa be there i want one thing i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">to interrupt you could you make me the</p>

<p begin="00:57:39.280" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">you can you can see me</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.680" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">participants over my name and</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">yes perfect so again with the modern</p>

<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">yes meta modern morality or morals</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.640" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">so first of all depending of course on</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">which of these meanings we look at</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">the answers are going to be different if</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">you look at</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">if you look at something like the phase</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">just meta modernism cultural phase the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">answer would likely be</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">no actually not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">but if we look at metamodern</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">metamodernism as philosophy or as</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">um as a cultural uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">stage of development or a societal stage</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">of development or ambitime</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to say yes we should</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">mention though that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">morality tends to develop particularly</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">in this soft the space of the soft</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">modernity largely inherited the</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">you should be against slavery you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t kill people</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.119" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">uh the the person who governs should do</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">so for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">um and uh many other things</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">but the point is that we&#39;re all equal in</p>

<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">of course but the point is that</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t invent a whole new morality it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">made real the morality that had just</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">in the clouds as it were or a beacon on</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">everyone religions would be against</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">war or at least against the unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">killing and so on</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2">uh but it wasn&#39;t until modernity showed</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">up that you actually got liberal</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">democracies who don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">and the same kind of goes for</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">it builds on the postmodern</p>

<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">a future</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:55.680" style="s2">hansi book that would be the sixth the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">fifth book in the hansi series if all</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.680" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">goes well</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">right so i i i does anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">wants to participate or does have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">question now is the chance to do so</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">do you hear me and can you talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">perfect okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:24.559" style="s2">so so you mentioned deontology like by</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">by principle so how about uh teleology</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">is isn&#39;t there a mixture always um</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">and try to find an equilibrium between</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">those two</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">uh principles of ethics</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:42.839" style="s2">um well so yeah that that brings up a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">a quite dense discussion and one which</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.839" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">um i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">clearly in my mind because it leads to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">fairly</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">advanced sudoku where you have to put</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:58.480" style="s2">these four</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">um these four forms of ethics</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.480" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">wilbur&#39;s four quadrants and then you</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">have to zoom in on each of them and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">you have to see how each of them contain</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">all of the others but</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">just saying a few basics deontology</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">and um and utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">have to coexist for the simple reason</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:24.079" style="s2">that the utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:26.559" style="s2">once you have established the principle</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">uh greatest possible benefit and at</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">possible suffering for the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:33.680" style="s2">possible number</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">is still a deontologist he or she</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.680" end="01:04:40.799" style="s2">has to just affirm</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:44.240" style="s2">that that ethical claim</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">religiously so all rationality and</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.240" end="01:04:48.960" style="s2">alcohol calculation follows</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:51.839" style="s2">from that first principle and that first</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.960" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">principle is not in itself utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.839" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">that first principle is a deontological</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">so so that&#39;s just one way of showing</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">their interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:10.720" style="s2">yeah questions welcome yeah uh it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.760" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">of a comment</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.720" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">uh now well you can say what you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:18.960" style="s2">about it uh so i&#39;ve heard the claim</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">that all</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.960" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">ethics evolved towards rule</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">and it seems true to me but i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">studied ethics enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">uh because if you started out being</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">utilitarian you soon realize that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:34.799" style="s2">like evaluating every situation isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:35.440" style="s2">practical so in practice you have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:38.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.440" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">come up with okay what are the rules i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.000" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">going to follow</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">uh in in each kind of situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">and also if you start out as the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">anthologist it&#39;s like okay but</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:50.160" style="s2">how do you pick your rules be the rules</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:54.319" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.160" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">leads to to maximum good um</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.319" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">does it seem right to you uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:05.640" style="s2">i i suppose um</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">so um so let&#39;s see um</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.640" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">if we uh um</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">well yeah we can go on a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:18.359" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">uh topic so so let&#39;s let&#39;s uh say</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.359" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">utilitarianism for instance um</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s already within this philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:27.520" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">which i&#39;m frankly not super acquainted</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.520" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">with but it&#39;s already within</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">the literature that you can have</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">arguments for utilitarianism meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:40.160" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:42.960" style="s2">a good heuristic would be uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.160" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">you will have greater utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.960" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">if not everybody walks around and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:54.799" style="s2">tries to tries to maximize</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">pleasure and and minimize pain all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.799" end="01:06:58.319" style="s2">time because then that takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">calculation and in the end they will</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.319" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">make a lot of mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:03.839" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll end up with a less</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.839" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">result and that leads us with</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">to the connection between utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">um and um</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">virtue ethics and virtue ethics just</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">says well this is an</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:26.839" style="s2">honest person this is a humble person</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">uh this is um generous person for</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.839" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">instance and</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:33.359" style="s2">um most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll make much more sense on an</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.359" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">individual level</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.640" end="01:07:38.160" style="s2">to just try to be honest generous and</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">human unhumbled</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.160" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">than to con then to uh and to hone those</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:44.640" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:46.319" style="s2">qualities which can be embodied and felt</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.640" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">rather than walk around like a computer</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.319" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">the rest of your life and try to</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">calculate your way</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">through every situation you you</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:55.839" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">um so yes there does appear to be a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.839" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">argument there but on a more</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">fractal level we zoom out and we view</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:06.640" style="s2">these different</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">forms of these different forms and</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.640" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.680" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">we can see that utilitarianism seems to</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:15.839" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">whenever we&#39;ve already set the social</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.839" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">contract</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">and the social contract is already in</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">place and</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">we um are</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:30.799" style="s2">we already have set uh deontological</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:34.159" style="s2">principles which we can agree upon</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.799" end="01:08:35.600" style="s2">and we already agree upon which virtues</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.159" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">we want to foster</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.600" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">in ourselves on one another and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:45.759" style="s2">we use our collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">on a aggregate level to calculate what</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.759" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">is good and bad and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">utilitarianism comes in right</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">i have a bit of a different questions</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">um uh so i know you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">summaries of metamodernism coming from</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">other other thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:18.640" style="s2">emphasize oscillation and you touched on</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">that a bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.640" end="01:09:22.880" style="s2">um how do you see your you know your set</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.880" end="01:09:27.759" style="s2">of definitions sitting with this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:28.480" style="s2">like oscillation as this primary thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.759" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">go forth</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.480" end="01:09:31.199" style="s2">and oscillate and i particularly bring</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">it up because i had encountered</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.199" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">previously and this oscillation thing i</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:37.199" style="s2">was like okay that&#39;s interesting but i</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">don&#39;t really feel a</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.199" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">big grab on it and it wasn&#39;t until</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:42.000" style="s2">coming across oh this developmental</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">approach i was like oh okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.000" end="01:09:45.279" style="s2">something here</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">so how do you see those views sitting</p>

<p begin="01:09:50.159" end="01:09:53.279" style="s2">in because it&#39;s a contested term it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:05.120" style="s2">there is indeed a</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:10.080" style="s2">so on it appears to</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">fit reasonably well in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.080" end="01:11:14.560" style="s2">it it jives with this principle of both</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">and thinking and i thought i</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.560" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">you know in wilbur you have this both</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:21.600" style="s2">end thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s also what i inherited</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.600" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">uh now what i found with the with</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">the metamodernists who had written about</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">this term</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">earlier and from simply the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.760" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">of the cultural phase the arts and so on</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">uh they had a richer language for it</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">which better</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:45.040" style="s2">caught the vibe so to speak um</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">they came up with magical reels with</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.040" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">oscillation</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">with informativity with sincere irony</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.640" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">and there was a lot to play with there</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">and what i felt it was very</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">integral no it was very meta-modern</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">so i felt you know they were culturally</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:06.320" style="s2">much more on the beat</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.400" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">with something that you know i felt</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.320" end="01:12:11.440" style="s2">would be salient</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:13.440" style="s2">and um sustainable culturally</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.440" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">sustainable in our day and age so</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.440" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">i felt if you take that metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">stuff and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:23.600" style="s2">put it in integralism and vice versa</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">uh you can get the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.600" end="01:12:27.040" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">you get a kind of design intervention in</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.040" end="01:12:32.320" style="s2">in uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">metamod in integralism which</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.320" end="01:12:36.800" style="s2">had many weaknesses but one of them was</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:40.080" style="s2">aesthetic you know that metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.800" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">had all these corny um</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.080" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">well well you know these very new agey</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">images uh and and it just doesn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">too much</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.040" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">most people it particularly just speaks</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">to the people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">um who can relate to those spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">experiences that are being uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">portrayed and and by the way it also has</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.280" end="01:13:02.400" style="s2">a difficulty living up to it because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not ironic enough and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.400" end="01:13:07.280" style="s2">presentation of itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:07.679" style="s2">um which also makes it prone to all of</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.280" end="01:13:11.199" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.679" end="01:13:14.800" style="s2">uh cases of hysteria where where people</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.199" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">uh over invest in well</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.800" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">gurus and so on and</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:21.679" style="s2">cast post modernism green is the central</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:25.040" style="s2">adversary</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.679" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">um is i think yeah integral has its own</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.040" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:31.520" style="s2">and and i agree that a modernism and</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">particularly particularly sincere irony</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.520" end="01:13:34.800" style="s2">i think is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">one of the things that grabs me a lot</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">okay that that that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:41.199" style="s2">yeah yeah how are you how you how you</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">got to that particular</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.199" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">synthesis yeah and thanks henry is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">sometimes i like superposition better so</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">but at the same time i feel ashamed</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">using it because i don&#39;t know so much</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">about quantum</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">theory i don&#39;t know what you mean but</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">um but superposition um</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">two things are entangled they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">interconnected</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in two places there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">a non-locality you can er</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.800" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">you can manipulate one thing and the</p>

<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">changes so it&#39;s in two places at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.400" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">same time and we need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.159" end="01:14:21.360" style="s2">be like oscillation sounds like you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:22.960" style="s2">to hurry back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.360" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">i like superposition better because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.960" end="01:14:26.880" style="s2">more static that</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:28.400" style="s2">you can be deep in the irony and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.880" end="01:14:30.080" style="s2">deeper you go in the irony the more</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">sincere you can get</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.080" end="01:14:36.960" style="s2">so you can write an outrageous book</p>

<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:47.040" style="s2">you do that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.960" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">you open up the space for being very</p>

<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:05.440" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t uh stand out aesthetically</p>

<p begin="01:16:10.159" end="01:16:13.199" style="s2">but yeah i don&#39;t like this they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.080" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">back and forth</p>

<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:39.360" style="s2">the framing of the listening society</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">sets you up so by the time you get to</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.520" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">chapters</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.560" end="01:16:46.080" style="s2">i in particular i found that that was</p>

<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:30.000" style="s2">a hermit the last few years but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.560" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">pleasure to meet you face to</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:39.760" style="s2">i i i i have to admit i was at least one</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.199" end="01:17:42.159" style="s2">notch behind you on the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.760" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">subjective well-being this evening and</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.159" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got me up at least a notch up to</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:50.000" style="s2">your level so thank you for that daniel</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">um my question was well i really wanted</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:52.719" style="s2">to allow</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:53.760" style="s2">you to elaborate on on something in</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.719" end="01:17:56.880" style="s2">particular because</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.760" end="01:17:59.679" style="s2">most of those six forms of metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.880" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">and metamodernity that you&#39;re outlining</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.679" end="01:18:04.560" style="s2">work to do with answering the question</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.560" end="01:18:11.760" style="s2">but hansi picks up on another</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:14.960" style="s2">greek word the the to do with the mataxi</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.760" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">metasis and in other words what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:18.239" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">the kind of concepts of in betweenness</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:23.199" style="s2">so i was hoping you might just be able</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:26.400" style="s2">to elaborate on the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.199" end="01:18:28.239" style="s2">the metaxic as well as matter in terms</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.400" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">of going beyond and</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:33.520" style="s2">saying what&#39;s next um well a</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">great pleasure to meet you also tim</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.520" end="01:18:37.199" style="s2">another person i have</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.880" end="01:18:38.880" style="s2">interacted with a lot and never had the</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.199" end="01:18:42.320" style="s2">pleasure to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.880" end="01:18:46.880" style="s2">so um yes first of all</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:50.520" style="s2">uh ataxia and so on is a stronger theme</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.880" end="01:18:54.000" style="s2">than in the cultural uh theorist</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.520" end="01:18:55.760" style="s2">metamodernists um so attacks metanoia</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.000" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">and brent cooper has done actually more</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.760" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">working he&#39;d like me</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">perhaps like say a few words about as</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:04.719" style="s2">well i notice he&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:08.480" style="s2">um but um</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.719" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">just my own two cents um</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.480" end="01:19:15.440" style="s2">they they look at metamodernism more</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">in this term like acids and that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:19.360" style="s2">between as a transition</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:20.480" style="s2">and so on as in between this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.360" end="01:19:22.640" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.480" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">part of any relational philosophy which</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.640" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">we could have also put up there with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.560" end="01:19:34.000" style="s2">um with meta modern philosophy uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.679" end="01:19:37.199" style="s2">term um and um</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.000" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">i i feel that it also makes sense to</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.199" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">talk about what the next</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.719" end="01:19:42.400" style="s2">stage that we want to construct looks</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.320" end="01:19:45.679" style="s2">like that being said we are in</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">in between us right now like we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.679" end="01:19:50.080" style="s2">been before we&#39;re in ten different time</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.320" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">types in between the in-betweeness and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.080" end="01:19:54.320" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">and so it is important and just to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.320" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:20:02.159" style="s2">the the particular historical moment um</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:04.159" style="s2">all of this relates to different</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.159" end="01:20:08.719" style="s2">theories of change of course</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.159" end="01:20:11.040" style="s2">uh the the most prominent one is</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.719" end="01:20:13.199" style="s2">well perhaps the the broken institute</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.040" end="01:20:16.639" style="s2">theory of change</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.199" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">which which says that</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:23.520" style="s2">one paradigm one big</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:27.280" style="s2">system uh matures</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.520" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">and then become you you see many little</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.280" end="01:20:31.040" style="s2">uh inventions of alternatives showing up</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.000" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">and as the other one</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.040" end="01:20:34.400" style="s2">starts to crash to under its own weight</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:37.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">it becomes more uh president it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.120" end="01:20:41.440" style="s2">more pressing</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:43.360" style="s2">uh for for these new agents to uh to</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.440" end="01:20:44.840" style="s2">take more and more responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.360" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">connect with each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.840" end="01:20:50.800" style="s2">and all of their work begins to</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:52.400" style="s2">congeal and they learn from best</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.800" end="01:20:54.239" style="s2">experiences and so on</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.400" end="01:20:55.520" style="s2">one thing goes down the other thing goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.239" end="01:20:58.880" style="s2">up right and</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.520" end="01:21:01.520" style="s2">we&#39;re at the we&#39;re in the steep hall</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.880" end="01:21:02.159" style="s2">of modernity and then we&#39;re in the rise</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.520" end="01:21:03.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.159" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">something new i would call it</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.440" end="01:21:08.320" style="s2">metamodernity and post-modernism then</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">is not in itself a stable phase it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.320" end="01:21:14.719" style="s2">critique of modernity</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:17.040" style="s2">um and it does and it showed up under</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.719" end="01:21:19.040" style="s2">modernity&#39;s let&#39;s say technological</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.040" end="01:21:21.040" style="s2">regime whereas</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.040" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">metamodernism is particularly an</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.040" end="01:21:24.639" style="s2">infinite phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:26.800" style="s2">and particularly linked to that social</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.639" end="01:21:27.679" style="s2">logic which is probably the sociology of</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.800" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.679" end="01:21:31.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s one way of seeing it another</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:34.800" style="s2">way which i</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.440" end="01:21:39.600" style="s2">uh in many ways prefer is that history</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.800" end="01:21:42.639" style="s2">involves movement and institution</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.600" end="01:21:44.000" style="s2">and so it goes back to um sociologist</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.639" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">albaroni</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.000" end="01:21:50.560" style="s2">um alberto alberon or something and he</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:52.719" style="s2">uh he says well that</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.560" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">institutions eventually crumble and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.719" end="01:21:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this moment</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:57.600" style="s2">of uh just rejoicement and joy where</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.880" end="01:21:59.199" style="s2">everything is up</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.600" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">in the ear and it&#39;s like falling in love</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.199" end="01:22:04.560" style="s2">everything becomes liquid for a while</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">before it congeals again</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.560" end="01:22:08.480" style="s2">um but there is also a sociological</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">theory called</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.480" end="01:22:13.199" style="s2">revolution and counter-revolution uh by</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">sima lipsid</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.199" end="01:22:19.760" style="s2">and the counter-revolution is</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:21.600" style="s2">the reaction to the revolution because</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.760" end="01:22:23.120" style="s2">the revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.600" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">given that it doesn&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.120" end="01:22:27.040" style="s2">unestablished structures</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">it contradicts a lot of the social</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">orders</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t build on a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:34.639" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:36.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s prone to failure and</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.639" end="01:22:39.760" style="s2">overreaction and uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.320" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">and all of other well just mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.760" end="01:22:43.760" style="s2">just a lot of mistakes uh so when the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:46.159" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.760" end="01:22:47.760" style="s2">does go wrong which it inevitably does</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.159" end="01:22:48.159" style="s2">which is kind of what has happened with</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.760" end="01:22:52.480" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.159" end="01:22:54.719" style="s2">postmodern fatigue society um</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.480" end="01:22:56.239" style="s2">there is a counter reaction just like</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.719" end="01:22:58.239" style="s2">after the french revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.239" end="01:22:59.760" style="s2">like in the early days of the french</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.239" end="01:23:00.800" style="s2">revolution people were walking around</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.760" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">naked down</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.800" end="01:23:04.800" style="s2">downtown literally and having sex with</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">whoever and</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.800" end="01:23:11.679" style="s2">like things were crazy and after a while</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">uh heads start rolling and wars erupt</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.679" end="01:23:18.400" style="s2">and then boom the old order</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.960" end="01:23:18.400" style="s2">reestablishes itself</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.960" end="01:23:22.639" style="s2">reacts very strongly is strongly</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.120" end="01:23:25.679" style="s2">reactionary</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.639" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">um it throws out all of that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.679" end="01:23:30.159" style="s2">new garbage whatever that was and tries</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">to continue where things were</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.159" end="01:23:35.920" style="s2">but they&#39;ve also picked up a bit of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">social dynamics of the new world</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.920" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">uh so eventually though it is</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:42.480" style="s2">when the counter reaction or when the</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:45.600" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.480" end="01:23:47.440" style="s2">revolution is defeated on its own terms</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.600" end="01:23:49.360" style="s2">because it never has</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.440" end="01:23:51.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look towards a new</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.360" end="01:23:53.840" style="s2">equilibrium state it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.040" end="01:23:56.880" style="s2">towards the future tractors</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.840" end="01:24:01.120" style="s2">so inevitably it&#39;s doomed</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.880" end="01:24:05.120" style="s2">um but it&#39;s going to win first</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.120" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">um to the excesses of the revolution</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.120" end="01:24:08.719" style="s2">and right now we&#39;re in that counter</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:12.880" style="s2">revolution which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.719" end="01:24:15.679" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing across europe uh in</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.880" end="01:24:16.639" style="s2">the united states in world politics at</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.679" end="01:24:19.520" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.639" end="01:24:20.400" style="s2">um and also in the cultural dynamics of</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.520" end="01:24:22.400" style="s2">our day and age</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.400" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">uh so and it&#39;s often during the</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.400" end="01:24:26.960" style="s2">counter-revolution that</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">most the worst atrocities are committed</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.960" end="01:24:31.840" style="s2">unfortunately so we&#39;re looking probably</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:36.080" style="s2">towards a fairly grim time</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.840" end="01:24:38.960" style="s2">which makes our seeding forms</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.080" end="01:24:39.280" style="s2">that we um come up with now and try on</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.960" end="01:24:41.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.280" end="01:24:43.199" style="s2">all the more important for for the time</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:45.520" style="s2">when they have matured</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.199" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">and the counter-revolution has run out</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.520" end="01:24:48.320" style="s2">of fuel and shown that</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually produce a much</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.320" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">better society</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:55.840" style="s2">um and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:57.600" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the in-betweenness</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.840" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">historically speaking that i feel we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.600" end="01:25:01.520" style="s2">in right</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:01.520" style="s2">now so we&#39;re in fairly dark times</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:07.440" style="s2">hopefully that brings everybody down a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.679" end="01:25:07.440" style="s2">notch against subjective state</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.679" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve gone up to 13.</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.639" end="01:25:24.719" style="s2">brent do you want to say something on</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.480" end="01:25:26.480" style="s2">metaxi and metamodernism and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.719" end="01:25:28.960" style="s2">stuff you&#39;ve written a lot more about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.480" end="01:25:28.960" style="s2">than i have</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.120" end="01:25:37.120" style="s2">sure thanks um i like your presentation</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.520" end="01:25:38.960" style="s2">uh you should you should include me in</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.120" end="01:25:43.280" style="s2">there somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.960" end="01:25:46.639" style="s2">um but uh no one thing i like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.280" end="01:25:48.400" style="s2">um you know kind of introduce kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.639" end="01:25:51.600" style="s2">injunction right is like</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.400" end="01:25:52.560" style="s2">these missed sources that i dug up like</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.600" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">borgman</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.560" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.080" end="01:26:01.840" style="s2">oh god i forget their names</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.600" end="01:26:04.480" style="s2">um there&#39;s there&#39;s several though the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.840" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">three or four from the 90s particular</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.480" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">and a couple from the 2000s that just</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:09.840" style="s2">aren&#39;t touched on</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:12.159" style="s2">and then you know my recent article on</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.840" end="01:26:14.159" style="s2">hyper modernism right i pivot that way</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.159" end="01:26:18.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s this parallel</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.159" end="01:26:22.080" style="s2">discourse and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.159" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">um let&#39;s say vermeulen and vandenker are</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.080" end="01:26:25.360" style="s2">they just chose not to pursue any of</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:26.719" style="s2">that right i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.360" end="01:26:28.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a mistake there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.719" end="01:26:30.480" style="s2">of interesting stuff there so it begs</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.880" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">the question of today</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.480" end="01:26:35.040" style="s2">how how we all came to this topic right</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:38.080" style="s2">and and discuss it</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.040" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">without this prior context and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.080" end="01:26:41.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a bad thing it actually it</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:44.639" style="s2">actually expands</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:47.600" style="s2">becomes more fractal because</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.639" end="01:26:48.960" style="s2">because we get this new research and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.600" end="01:26:51.040" style="s2">dovetails with the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.960" end="01:26:53.199" style="s2">historicity which is in in both</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.040" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">metamodernism and hypermodernism</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.199" end="01:26:58.000" style="s2">so we get to examine the past 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:27:00.719" style="s2">as a period right post-col</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.000" end="01:27:02.639" style="s2">post-cold war is when both of these</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.719" end="01:27:03.679" style="s2">phases really began</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.639" end="01:27:06.239" style="s2">and then of course it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.679" end="01:27:09.360" style="s2">crystallized after 2000</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.239" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">with the internet and 911. so i think</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.360" end="01:27:13.760" style="s2">i think these have been missing pieces</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.239" end="01:27:17.120" style="s2">of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.760" end="01:27:18.560" style="s2">but of course like daniel&#39;s framing is</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.120" end="01:27:21.199" style="s2">very comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.560" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2">uh excellent kind of six dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.199" end="01:27:27.280" style="s2">meta theory pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.000" end="01:27:29.520" style="s2">to undermine that it&#39;s very robust</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.280" end="01:27:31.679" style="s2">but i but i try to i try to historicize</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.520" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">it right and also problematize</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.679" end="01:27:35.760" style="s2">the way people come to metamodernism and</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.480" style="s2">misunderstand it</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.760" end="01:27:40.080" style="s2">as you touched on right and so so</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.480" end="01:27:41.280" style="s2">there&#39;s different um</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.080" end="01:27:43.120" style="s2">you know people with different</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.280" end="01:27:44.800" style="s2">ideologies that they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.120" end="01:27:46.800" style="s2">trying you know they&#39;re trying to level</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.800" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">up and trying to get away from</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.800" end="01:27:51.120" style="s2">these past ideologies or political</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">alliances but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.120" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">trapped by it um</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:00.880" style="s2">so yeah i guess that that&#39;s all i wanted</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.199" end="01:28:04.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.880" end="01:28:15.840" style="s2">kind of unpack but if anyone has any</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.000" end="01:28:15.840" style="s2">questions on that i can go deeper</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.480" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">yeah thanks friend</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.760" end="01:28:40.320" style="s2">well well i had a thought coming up uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.000" end="01:28:42.960" style="s2">why um in your lecture</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.320" end="01:28:45.199" style="s2">when you mentioned autophases right as</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.960" end="01:28:47.679" style="s2">one of those engines</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.199" end="01:28:48.560" style="s2">um so so could you elaborate a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.679" end="01:28:50.719" style="s2">bit on that of</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.560" end="01:28:52.880" style="s2">the relationship between metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.719" end="01:28:56.080" style="s2">and autopoisons if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.880" end="01:28:56.719" style="s2">any how does it play out because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.080" end="01:29:00.239" style="s2">a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.719" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">interesting concept in general</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.239" end="01:29:08.719" style="s2">and you know nope you get my question</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">yeah so so uh first of all uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.719" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">i&#39;d like to uh make a caveat that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:15.679" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:18.239" style="s2">er i&#39;m not necessarily uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.679" end="01:29:18.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.040" end="01:29:26.400" style="s2">a huge subscriber to all the polices</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.800" end="01:29:29.679" style="s2">as as it&#39;s often used</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.400" end="01:29:32.960" style="s2">namely as self-organization and</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.679" end="01:29:36.639" style="s2">it to be contrasted with than</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.960" end="01:29:38.639" style="s2">than engineering and control</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.639" end="01:29:40.000" style="s2">because i think that might be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.639" end="01:29:43.719" style="s2">false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.000" end="01:29:45.920" style="s2">if you zoom out we&#39;re never quite out of</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.719" end="01:29:46.960" style="s2">self-organization of course you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.920" end="01:29:48.719" style="s2">agents in the world</p>

<p begin="01:29:48.719" end="01:29:52.480" style="s2">environment uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.159" end="01:29:53.280" style="s2">that&#39;s engineering but if you uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.480" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">crisscross</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.280" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">all of those different uh perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:29:59.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.960" end="01:30:01.520" style="s2">all those different agencies you do have</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.360" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">a self-organization</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.520" end="01:30:04.960" style="s2">the point is that the self-organization</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:07.840" style="s2">can can then</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.960" end="01:30:08.400" style="s2">land on stable equilibria like like a</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.840" end="01:30:11.120" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.400" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">ecosystem or it can have some agents</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.120" end="01:30:16.000" style="s2">taking too much control</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.639" end="01:30:18.960" style="s2">and not having feedback processes which</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.000" end="01:30:20.639" style="s2">regulate them back into what is good for</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.960" end="01:30:23.199" style="s2">the wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.639" end="01:30:24.239" style="s2">so for instance human beings get super</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.199" end="01:30:27.040" style="s2">much control</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.239" end="01:30:29.120" style="s2">after we develop all these technologies</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.040" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">and organize ourselves into modern</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.120" end="01:30:33.360" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:33.360" style="s2">and then we make um</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.679" end="01:30:37.920" style="s2">well huge irrigation projects and</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:40.000" style="s2">whatnot which then disconnect from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.920" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">self-organization that exists in</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.000" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">local communities and also</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.679" end="01:30:46.960" style="s2">might fail to integrate the systems of</p>

<p begin="01:30:46.960" end="01:30:50.400" style="s2">and so they are huge failures sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.520" end="01:30:54.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.400" end="01:30:58.000" style="s2">cause incredible damage so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.800" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">i mean that kind of takes the boat and</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.000" end="01:31:01.679" style="s2">there that yes there is a critique</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.400" end="01:31:05.360" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.679" end="01:31:06.719" style="s2">against engineering social engineering</p>

<p begin="01:31:06.719" end="01:31:13.440" style="s2">but at the same time we can never fully</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.400" end="01:31:15.040" style="s2">disentangle the two concepts of agency</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.440" end="01:31:17.679" style="s2">and planned</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.040" end="01:31:19.520" style="s2">engineering which just means</p>

<p begin="01:31:23.440" end="01:31:27.760" style="s2">there&#39;s not like this pure innocent</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.080" end="01:31:32.320" style="s2">autophages and this</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.760" end="01:31:36.080" style="s2">uh evil control freak of an engineer</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.320" end="01:31:39.280" style="s2">on the other hand what what does exist</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.080" end="01:31:42.800" style="s2">are the feedback loops which are too</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.280" end="01:31:46.880" style="s2">slow or too disconnected</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.800" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">so that things fall out of autopleases</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.880" end="01:31:53.760" style="s2">in terms of a certain unit of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:56.960" style="s2">for instance an ecosystem so right now</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.760" end="01:31:59.760" style="s2">humanity has is</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.960" end="01:32:02.080" style="s2">a species on earth among many others and</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.760" end="01:32:05.120" style="s2">we have self-organized in societies</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.080" end="01:32:08.000" style="s2">but the feedback processes from</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.120" end="01:32:09.120" style="s2">from nature are too slow so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.000" end="01:32:11.199" style="s2">regulate back</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.120" end="01:32:12.880" style="s2">when we harm nature because it harms us</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.199" end="01:32:16.239" style="s2">back too slowly and too</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.880" end="01:32:19.360" style="s2">regularly for us to naturally</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.239" end="01:32:21.440" style="s2">regulate back and then we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.360" end="01:32:22.560" style="s2">make forecasts about the environment and</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.440" end="01:32:26.480" style="s2">start talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.560" end="01:32:29.840" style="s2">but our whole institutions and so on and</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.480" end="01:32:31.199" style="s2">habits and way of life are entirely</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.840" end="01:32:34.239" style="s2">disconnected from that</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.199" end="01:32:38.480" style="s2">feedback process um so</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.239" end="01:32:41.440" style="s2">that being said yes metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.480" end="01:32:42.000" style="s2">as a sentiment and also as a philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.440" end="01:32:46.480" style="s2">looking at</p>

<p begin="01:32:54.320" end="01:33:01.600" style="s2">as its dna as it were um</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.000" end="01:33:06.239" style="s2">it lines up with autophagic theories</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.600" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2">such as we should identify with a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.239" end="01:33:10.400" style="s2">perspective with a wider perspective or</p>

<p begin="01:33:28.480" end="01:33:36.159" style="s2">and also in terms of organization then</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.000" end="01:33:39.600" style="s2">we will try to maximize the autonomy</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.159" end="01:33:42.000" style="s2">of uh and the sovereignty of each</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.280" end="01:34:12.320" style="s2">to get to auto pleases you have to</p>

<p begin="01:34:44.800" end="01:34:49.440" style="s2">like we know that these suggestions</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.679" end="01:34:50.960" style="s2">might not work but we have to try them</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.440" end="01:34:51.600" style="s2">because we have to develop together</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.960" end="01:34:54.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.600" end="01:34:58.719" style="s2">right yes yes i mean this</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.880" end="01:35:01.320" style="s2">and and of course i was thinking uh</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.719" end="01:35:02.560" style="s2">uh uh about autopsies as an</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.320" end="01:35:05.760" style="s2">intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.560" end="01:35:07.440" style="s2">connected part of psychology and uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.760" end="01:35:09.280" style="s2">outer places of consciousness and</p>

<p begin="01:35:09.280" end="01:35:13.760" style="s2">you know because you can&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.840" end="01:35:16.159" style="s2">developmental stages up to a point</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.760" end="01:35:17.679" style="s2">without thinking about autopoaces</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.159" end="01:35:19.440" style="s2">and how the um how the how the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.679" end="01:35:22.639" style="s2">consciousness works and</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.440" end="01:35:24.400" style="s2">and the psychology and so like even in</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.639" end="01:35:26.280" style="s2">simple models like keegan and</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.400" end="01:35:28.400" style="s2">and self-authorship and</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.280" end="01:35:31.679" style="s2">self-transformation so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.400" end="01:35:33.520" style="s2">this element of autopsies come into play</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.679" end="01:35:36.239" style="s2">and how we use our consciousness you</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.520" end="01:35:39.760" style="s2">know and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.239" end="01:35:42.159" style="s2">it&#39;s very very similar to metamodern</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:43.600" style="s2">modernism as a as a psychological stage</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.159" end="01:35:48.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.600" end="01:35:51.440" style="s2">yes i i do believe it is and actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.400" end="01:35:55.440" style="s2">in when we look at the</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.440" end="01:35:57.600" style="s2">different meta memes as</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.440" end="01:35:58.719" style="s2">when we look at metamodernism as a meta</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.600" end="01:36:02.639" style="s2">meme it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.719" end="01:36:07.360" style="s2">certain cultural um</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.639" end="01:36:10.960" style="s2">generator function so it generates</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.360" end="01:36:13.600" style="s2">culture of a certain kind or or just</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.960" end="01:36:16.000" style="s2">actually the same is true of</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.600" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">post-modernism so for instance</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.000" end="01:36:19.199" style="s2">look at the painting over there it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.480" end="01:36:21.360" style="s2">impressive</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.199" end="01:36:23.119" style="s2">i made it a bunch of years ago</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.360" end="01:36:26.400" style="s2">nevertheless you can look at it</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.119" end="01:36:29.679" style="s2">and see that is this painting</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.400" end="01:36:31.920" style="s2">from the 1700s</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.679" end="01:36:33.360" style="s2">and you can just answer no and it</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.920" end="01:36:38.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have anything to do</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.360" end="01:36:40.480" style="s2">with my developmental stage as an artist</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.159" end="01:36:41.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just the fact that i live in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.480" end="01:36:44.960" style="s2">postmodern world</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.840" end="01:36:48.800" style="s2">so uh flattening things up</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.960" end="01:36:51.040" style="s2">and uh and making a dreamy symbolical</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.800" end="01:36:52.000" style="s2">landscape which is maybe a sea maybe not</p>

<p begin="01:36:52.000" end="01:36:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe a son who knows</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.159" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of expressed emotion</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.000" end="01:37:02.320" style="s2">in it even though</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.520" end="01:37:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not very well expressed the the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.320" end="01:37:06.800" style="s2">that very thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.760" end="01:37:09.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t be conceived</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.800" end="01:37:10.800" style="s2">if you&#39;re not in the post-modern</p>

<p begin="01:37:10.800" end="01:37:16.800" style="s2">um and and this is so so they</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.159" end="01:37:17.840" style="s2">they are kind of auto poetic systems in</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.800" end="01:37:20.000" style="s2">and of the moment</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.840" end="01:37:21.040" style="s2">in and of themselves has generated</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.000" end="01:37:24.480" style="s2">function and the same</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.040" end="01:37:27.600" style="s2">goes i believe but i can&#39;t prove it</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.480" end="01:37:30.960" style="s2">for how our for how our</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.600" end="01:37:34.239" style="s2">mind works meaning that uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.960" end="01:37:36.320" style="s2">well so let&#39;s say somebody has</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.239" end="01:37:37.280" style="s2">a thousand different propositions that</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.320" end="01:37:40.400" style="s2">they believe in</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.280" end="01:37:43.520" style="s2">which link up together and they</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.400" end="01:37:47.440" style="s2">all um they</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.520" end="01:37:50.239" style="s2">all support one another at least partly</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.440" end="01:37:52.080" style="s2">and they uh together they make up a</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.239" end="01:37:54.159" style="s2">post-modern world view</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.080" end="01:37:56.000" style="s2">along comes comes your meta-modern</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.159" end="01:37:57.040" style="s2">friend and says a meta-modern</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.000" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.040" end="01:38:04.159" style="s2">and it contradicts a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.800" end="01:38:07.840" style="s2">presuppositions that you already have so</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.159" end="01:38:09.840" style="s2">your gravity just pulls it down</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.840" end="01:38:12.480" style="s2">and falsifies it it&#39;s just like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.840" end="01:38:14.960" style="s2">no way this one can be true because then</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.480" end="01:38:16.960" style="s2">all of this one these 1 000 different</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.960" end="01:38:20.159" style="s2">things that i uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.960" end="01:38:23.960" style="s2">that i already believe would not be true</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.159" end="01:38:25.840" style="s2">rather than for for the</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.960" end="01:38:26.800" style="s2">self-organizational system of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.840" end="01:38:30.080" style="s2">to shift</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.800" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">you have to shift and</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.080" end="01:38:37.040" style="s2">500 or more of those little little</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.679" end="01:38:39.199" style="s2">nodes or stars on your sky uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.040" end="01:38:41.360" style="s2">into new constellations and then they</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.199" end="01:38:43.119" style="s2">link up and then they start</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.360" end="01:38:44.800" style="s2">because the mind is always the process</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.119" end="01:38:47.360" style="s2">always doing things and then</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.800" end="01:38:48.080" style="s2">they start doing things in new patterns</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.360" end="01:38:51.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.080" end="01:38:53.840" style="s2">a self-organization um</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.119" end="01:38:55.360" style="s2">these uh and interestingly then i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.840" end="01:38:57.280" style="s2">know if others have noticed this but</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.360" end="01:39:01.760" style="s2">when i talk to you guys for instance</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.280" end="01:39:04.239" style="s2">and and a select crowd like this one</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.760" end="01:39:05.600" style="s2">the words just kind of flow you know i</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.239" end="01:39:07.360" style="s2">just you just</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.600" end="01:39:09.280" style="s2">ask me all sorts of difficult questions</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.360" end="01:39:12.480" style="s2">i come up with some kind of answer</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.280" end="01:39:15.040" style="s2">and and i kind of feel supported by</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.480" end="01:39:17.199" style="s2">like just the vibe i&#39;m in by the</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.040" end="01:39:19.119" style="s2">presuppositions of the crowd</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.199" end="01:39:21.920" style="s2">well then i go down to i don&#39;t know my</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.119" end="01:39:23.679" style="s2">old colleagues at the university or my</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.920" end="01:39:27.199" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.679" end="01:39:29.600" style="s2">and i try to explain just</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.199" end="01:39:30.960" style="s2">something i view differently and i just</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.600" end="01:39:33.520" style="s2">can&#39;t find the words</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.960" end="01:39:35.119" style="s2">right because well trans personal</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.520" end="01:39:38.560" style="s2">perspective right but</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.119" end="01:39:43.840" style="s2">that like i don&#39;t have the other</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.560" end="01:39:43.840" style="s2">points to link to i can you know i can</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.800" end="01:39:48.400" style="s2">i can tinker a little bit with one or</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.800" end="01:39:50.880" style="s2">two points and say wouldn&#39;t it be</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.400" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">interesting if or blah blah blah but</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.880" end="01:39:54.320" style="s2">but by and large i&#39;ll find i have a</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:39:57.679" style="s2">whole like</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.320" end="01:40:00.960" style="s2">other part of me which just</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.679" end="01:40:01.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t there&#39;s a barrier i can&#39;t breach</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.960" end="01:40:04.719" style="s2">and i can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.840" end="01:40:06.560" style="s2">past it and i just can&#39;t speak and even</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.719" end="01:40:08.960" style="s2">if we go deep into discussions i</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.560" end="01:40:10.560" style="s2">i can&#39;t come up with anything to say and</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.960" end="01:40:12.800" style="s2">that would be metamodern</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.560" end="01:40:14.400" style="s2">so then i&#39;ll stay within a postmodern or</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.800" end="01:40:16.719" style="s2">modern uh</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.400" end="01:40:17.679" style="s2">mindset and i&#39;ll also not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.719" end="01:40:20.560" style="s2">think of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.679" end="01:40:21.600" style="s2">while i&#39;m going there a little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.560" end="01:40:23.760" style="s2">the thoughts will be</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.600" end="01:40:25.760" style="s2">farther away from me so they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.760" end="01:40:29.119" style="s2">transpersonal they&#39;re also in in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.760" end="01:40:29.119" style="s2">field so to speak right</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.679" end="01:40:38.320" style="s2">which again i mean speaks</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.520" end="01:40:40.000" style="s2">a lot to this thing about viewing</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.320" end="01:40:42.800" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.000" end="01:40:44.080" style="s2">as a movement that as a movement on a</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.800" end="01:40:46.159" style="s2">deep level even though we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.080" end="01:40:48.239" style="s2">calling it metamodernism necessarily and</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.159" end="01:40:48.880" style="s2">there are all these interconnected dots</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.239" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.880" end="01:40:53.119" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to have much in common</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.840" end="01:40:56.560" style="s2">nevertheless</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.119" end="01:40:57.119" style="s2">um you can enter into these different</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.560" end="01:41:00.960" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.119" end="01:41:03.440" style="s2">and and kind of interact a lot</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.960" end="01:41:04.080" style="s2">along this self-organizational logic</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.440" end="01:41:07.520" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.080" end="01:41:09.119" style="s2">that you experience and also the</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.520" end="01:41:12.719" style="s2">embodiment becomes different</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.119" end="01:41:13.840" style="s2">um you also you just become a different</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.719" end="01:41:17.280" style="s2">person like you</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.840" end="01:41:19.199" style="s2">like your metamodern self or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.280" end="01:41:20.320" style="s2">which is also a big part of why i had to</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.199" end="01:41:23.440" style="s2">isolate myself</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.320" end="01:41:25.600" style="s2">uh writing the books by the way um just</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.440" end="01:41:30.840" style="s2">to get away from all the gravity</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.600" end="01:41:33.840" style="s2">that where i couldn&#39;t access that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.840" end="01:41:33.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.320" end="01:41:39.199" style="s2">as your neurology goes into a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.280" end="01:41:41.199" style="s2">stress response if you&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.199" end="01:41:42.639" style="s2">this different perspective</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.199" end="01:41:45.040" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s things aren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.639" end="01:41:47.280" style="s2">to land the right way</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.040" end="01:41:48.239" style="s2">yeah i guess that could be a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.280" end="01:41:50.560" style="s2">it uh i</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.239" end="01:41:52.480" style="s2">i mean hey i wish i was a bigger person</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.560" end="01:41:55.600" style="s2">than that and could live up to</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.480" end="01:41:58.320" style="s2">well that&#39;s just more perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.600" end="01:41:59.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll play with it but uh but oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.320" end="01:42:02.639" style="s2">i do</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.520" end="01:42:03.679" style="s2">feel a bit of distance and well as you</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.639" end="01:42:05.679" style="s2">age of course you</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.679" end="01:42:07.760" style="s2">uh you learn to live with it and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.679" end="01:42:08.239" style="s2">you accept that for what it is and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.760" end="01:42:10.639" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.239" end="01:42:12.480" style="s2">find well there are many ways to relate</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.639" end="01:42:13.679" style="s2">to other people and once you&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.480" end="01:42:16.159" style="s2">had your fill</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.679" end="01:42:17.199" style="s2">with meta modern code and culture and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.159" end="01:42:19.760" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.199" end="01:42:20.320" style="s2">then it becomes more okay that people</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.760" end="01:42:22.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.320" end="01:42:24.880" style="s2">different and we have different settings</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.960" end="01:42:27.440" style="s2">to be in right</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.880" end="01:42:29.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m also thinking a bit in the in</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.440" end="01:42:32.480" style="s2">the cultural somatics frame</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.440" end="01:42:33.600" style="s2">of kind of what kind of attachment is</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.480" end="01:42:36.080" style="s2">there between the</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.600" end="01:42:38.000" style="s2">the emerging meta-modern culture and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.080" end="01:42:40.080" style="s2">postmodern or modern</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.000" end="01:42:42.239" style="s2">cultures and it&#39;s not a secure</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.080" end="01:42:42.960" style="s2">relationship at this point right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.239" end="01:42:44.560" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.960" end="01:42:45.920" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough of an established</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.560" end="01:42:47.840" style="s2">base particularly if you&#39;re outside of</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.920" end="01:42:49.920" style="s2">your supportive context</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.840" end="01:42:51.520" style="s2">to really have that kind of secure</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.920" end="01:42:53.199" style="s2">attachment neurological relationship</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.520" end="01:42:54.320" style="s2">with a different cultural context around</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.199" end="01:42:57.040" style="s2">you right now</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.320" end="01:42:58.560" style="s2">and and that&#39;s i don&#39;t know as you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.040" end="01:42:59.760" style="s2">i&#39;m very fascinated by this cultural</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.560" end="01:43:02.719" style="s2">semantics uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.760" end="01:43:04.400" style="s2">frame and like what kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.719" end="01:43:06.000" style="s2">cultural interactions can be modeled</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.400" end="01:43:10.080" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.000" end="01:43:14.639" style="s2">yes uh i i agree uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.080" end="01:43:18.080" style="s2">and i think um i think um</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.639" end="01:43:20.960" style="s2">that this was something i was</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.080" end="01:43:21.920" style="s2">talking to uh jim rutt with on his</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.960" end="01:43:25.679" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.920" end="01:43:26.080" style="s2">uh that and and this is connects back to</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.679" end="01:43:29.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.080" end="01:43:32.400" style="s2">fourth age the hermetics right</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.360" end="01:43:33.520" style="s2">um that there is a particular role for</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.400" end="01:43:37.119" style="s2">this category</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.520" end="01:43:40.639" style="s2">within uh uh within the metamodernists</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.119" end="01:43:44.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re a little less outward</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.639" end="01:43:45.040" style="s2">bound so hipsters engage with all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.400" end="01:43:47.199" style="s2">of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.040" end="01:43:49.600" style="s2">around them as do of course hackers and</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.199" end="01:43:51.600" style="s2">hippies as well</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.600" end="01:43:52.960" style="s2">whereas introvert types are often a</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.600" end="01:43:56.239" style="s2">little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.960" end="01:43:59.600" style="s2">the the hermetics and um</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.239" end="01:44:00.800" style="s2">and they have a particular role to play</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.600" end="01:44:03.280" style="s2">when it comes to creating</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.800" end="01:44:04.000" style="s2">well meta-modern temples where we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.280" end="01:44:06.719" style="s2">charge</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.000" end="01:44:08.000" style="s2">our batteries as it were culturally and</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.719" end="01:44:11.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.000" end="01:44:12.239" style="s2">embody stuff better and and just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.119" end="01:44:15.440" style="s2">feel supported by</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.239" end="01:44:17.199" style="s2">my community and culture uh which feels</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.440" end="01:44:20.080" style="s2">a little bit esoteric but just a little</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.199" end="01:44:21.600" style="s2">bit just ironically esoteric right</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.080" end="01:44:23.760" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t actually have anything to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.600" end="01:44:26.400" style="s2">hide right</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.760" end="01:44:27.440" style="s2">but but sometimes it helps to have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.400" end="01:44:30.400" style="s2">of space</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.440" end="01:44:32.800" style="s2">yeah and and so some interesting rituals</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.400" end="01:44:35.520" style="s2">and these can be reinvented</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.800" end="01:44:36.400" style="s2">like continually but we need to probably</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.520" end="01:44:39.360" style="s2">as a movement</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.400" end="01:44:40.719" style="s2">become better at that and i um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.360" end="01:44:43.600" style="s2">optimistic that i see</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.719" end="01:44:45.840" style="s2">more and more of this tendency at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.600" end="01:44:48.719" style="s2">same time of course is a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.840" end="01:44:50.880" style="s2">dangerous path to walk because hey then</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.719" end="01:44:54.239" style="s2">you get into all the stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.880" end="01:44:55.679" style="s2">well esoteric stuff basically but when</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.239" end="01:44:58.159" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s difficult to explain to</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.679" end="01:45:02.320" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.159" end="01:45:05.600" style="s2">psychedelic practices not least and</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.320" end="01:45:09.280" style="s2">and this um</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.600" end="01:45:09.840" style="s2">this creates um this can also create a</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.280" end="01:45:13.040" style="s2">chasm</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.840" end="01:45:15.840" style="s2">or and actually also slides into</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.040" end="01:45:17.600" style="s2">things that that are connected to</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.840" end="01:45:19.360" style="s2">esoterism and occultism</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.600" end="01:45:21.440" style="s2">for instance far-right thinking where</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.360" end="01:45:22.560" style="s2">you feel like whoa i felt the strong</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.440" end="01:45:24.320" style="s2">energy so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.560" end="01:45:25.760" style="s2">make this strong energy take over</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.320" end="01:45:29.119" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.760" end="01:45:31.600" style="s2">not not a good idea yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.119" end="01:45:33.360" style="s2">i i find i find some hopeful things in</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.600" end="01:45:35.520" style="s2">the uh in the immersive theater</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.360" end="01:45:37.040" style="s2">uh scene the interactive theater uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.520" end="01:45:38.560" style="s2">festival practices</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.040" end="01:45:40.719" style="s2">that are pretty big here in in san</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.560" end="01:45:43.360" style="s2">francisco or were when we could</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.719" end="01:45:44.800" style="s2">run off and have big interactive groups</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.360" end="01:45:48.000" style="s2">of people running around in</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.800" end="01:45:51.199" style="s2">in costumes and and and story lines</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.000" end="01:45:55.199" style="s2">uh but that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.199" end="01:45:56.960" style="s2">uh a a supportive ritual that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.199" end="01:45:58.960" style="s2">it brings in both the irony and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.960" end="01:46:00.560" style="s2">sincerity um you know it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.960" end="01:46:02.080" style="s2">looking for authentic connection but in</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.560" end="01:46:03.840" style="s2">the context of</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.080" end="01:46:06.320" style="s2">some sort of crazy plot line that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.840" end="01:46:09.280" style="s2">all agreed is real for the weekend</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.320" end="01:46:10.320" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s the kind of place where</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.280" end="01:46:12.719" style="s2">i see some ritual</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.320" end="01:46:13.360" style="s2">possibilities emerging this appears to</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.719" end="01:46:15.520" style="s2">be a</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.360" end="01:46:16.880" style="s2">recurring theme actually so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.520" end="01:46:21.600" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.880" end="01:46:21.600" style="s2">uh i i noticed you were waving michael</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.679" end="01:46:25.600" style="s2">yeah i was uh more curious what you said</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.800" end="01:46:27.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.600" end="01:46:29.280" style="s2">when you show up in a setting like this</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.520" end="01:46:30.880" style="s2">as you met a modern self and</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.280" end="01:46:33.040" style="s2">stuff i&#39;ve been noticed certainly now</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.880" end="01:46:35.280" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing in digital contest</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.040" end="01:46:37.280" style="s2">on a screen in zoom here but still you</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.280" end="01:46:38.880" style="s2">can summon your metal modern self when</p>

<p begin="01:46:38.880" end="01:46:41.520" style="s2">think are</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.679" end="01:46:42.719" style="s2">meta modern and what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.520" end="01:46:44.880" style="s2">really i&#39;ve been noticing</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.719" end="01:46:46.000" style="s2">it all summer and fall when i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.880" end="01:46:49.870" style="s2">circle some course</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.000" end="01:46:52.970" style="s2">you i just show up as a a more me</p>

<p begin="01:46:53.199" end="01:46:56.639" style="s2">so so i think henry might have said part</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.360" end="01:47:00.080" style="s2">of it that</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.639" end="01:47:02.800" style="s2">uh that well if we feel that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.080" end="01:47:04.159" style="s2">going to say isn&#39;t going to be super</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.800" end="01:47:06.639" style="s2">well understood</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.159" end="01:47:08.719" style="s2">and maybe what we feel also when we feel</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.639" end="01:47:10.880" style="s2">the kind of expression that we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.719" end="01:47:12.480" style="s2">is going to be misunderstood and</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.880" end="01:47:14.480" style="s2">misrepresented</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.480" end="01:47:15.679" style="s2">and then we get a little bit nervous and</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.480" end="01:47:18.560" style="s2">nervous</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.679" end="01:47:20.320" style="s2">shuts down shuts down complex processes</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.560" end="01:47:23.199" style="s2">right so that&#39;s i&#39;m not on a very</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.320" end="01:47:23.760" style="s2">simple visceral level that could be it</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.199" end="01:47:26.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.760" end="01:47:28.000" style="s2">but um but the other part i really think</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.400" end="01:47:30.719" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.000" end="01:47:32.000" style="s2">uh like well we&#39;re social beings we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.719" end="01:47:35.600" style="s2">interactive beings</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.000" end="01:47:39.040" style="s2">and interactive beings uh so that like</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.600" end="01:47:40.239" style="s2">you say something it prompts me to do</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.040" end="01:47:44.159" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.239" end="01:47:47.199" style="s2">and so uh like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.159" end="01:47:50.719" style="s2">like a dance or whatever right so uh</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.199" end="01:47:54.400" style="s2">you will throw me balls which</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.719" end="01:47:57.760" style="s2">for me aren&#39;t curved balls i can</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.400" end="01:48:00.960" style="s2">catch them they make sense to me uh</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.760" end="01:48:01.199" style="s2">i can feel i can play with it we get in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.960" end="01:48:05.119" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.199" end="01:48:08.320" style="s2">more playful mood and and</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.119" end="01:48:11.119" style="s2">like there are enough uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.320" end="01:48:11.119" style="s2">there are enough</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.320" end="01:48:18.000" style="s2">presuppositions shared for for like</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.920" end="01:48:19.119" style="s2">a breakdown of the conversation not to</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.000" end="01:48:22.560" style="s2">be imminent</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.119" end="01:48:24.560" style="s2">every 20 seconds so</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.560" end="01:48:25.760" style="s2">this helped we help each other to</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.560" end="01:48:28.960" style="s2">stretch our minds</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.760" end="01:48:32.080" style="s2">into more complex modes of</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.960" end="01:48:35.679" style="s2">thinking and being and now of course</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.080" end="01:48:37.280" style="s2">um the critique of against this is that</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.679" end="01:48:38.800" style="s2">when we stretch our minds and do more</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.280" end="01:48:41.280" style="s2">pretty into more</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.800" end="01:48:42.159" style="s2">complexity we also disembodied a little</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.280" end="01:48:45.440" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.159" end="01:48:49.119" style="s2">uh because then we&#39;re in our heads</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.440" end="01:48:52.400" style="s2">and i have to say i&#39;m i&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.119" end="01:48:54.639" style="s2">scared of um disembodiment</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.400" end="01:48:55.440" style="s2">for uh for a little while here and there</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.639" end="01:48:57.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.440" end="01:48:59.520" style="s2">uh because well i mean sure if you get</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.679" end="01:49:03.119" style="s2">stuck in it</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.520" end="01:49:06.560" style="s2">and uh you get less sensual or</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.119" end="01:49:09.119" style="s2">less sexual or less less uh</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.560" end="01:49:10.320" style="s2">alive or something then that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.119" end="01:49:13.280" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.320" end="01:49:14.480" style="s2">or you forget to tune in your feelings</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.280" end="01:49:17.679" style="s2">and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.480" end="01:49:18.480" style="s2">but for a while it&#39;s okay to be in our</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.679" end="01:49:21.040" style="s2">heads and</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.480" end="01:49:22.080" style="s2">play with ideas and then it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.040" end="01:49:24.960" style="s2">inherent tension</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.080" end="01:49:26.800" style="s2">in meta-modernism that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.960" end="01:49:29.760" style="s2">trying to go very very</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.800" end="01:49:32.960" style="s2">uh complex and we&#39;re trying to go you</p>

<p begin="01:49:38.480" end="01:49:41.280" style="s2">might be better</p>

<p begin="01:49:47.360" end="01:49:56.239" style="s2">and ideally we could get into</p>

<p begin="01:49:56.239" end="01:50:00.239" style="s2">linda wrote in the chat that she will</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.639" end="01:50:01.119" style="s2">explain what it actually means at some</p>

<p begin="01:50:01.119" end="01:50:09.119" style="s2">uh but um but i ideally we could really</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.320" end="01:50:11.280" style="s2">be in both and maybe in the future we as</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.119" end="01:50:14.719" style="s2">individuals and we together will be</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.280" end="01:50:15.679" style="s2">incapable of that uh integralism claimed</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.719" end="01:50:18.400" style="s2">to be that</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.679" end="01:50:20.159" style="s2">um but in many ways it&#39;s it failed</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.400" end="01:50:21.920" style="s2">particularly on the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.159" end="01:50:26.480" style="s2">stringency side</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.920" end="01:50:30.639" style="s2">and the depth and community and</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.480" end="01:50:33.040" style="s2">communion would would trump uh</p>

<p begin="01:50:33.840" end="01:50:40.960" style="s2">right so so we have to be defenders</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.000" end="01:50:41.679" style="s2">of both of these sides i guess um and</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.960" end="01:50:43.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.679" end="01:50:45.520" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s a part of the tension</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.679" end="01:50:52.400" style="s2">that never leaves us</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.520" end="01:50:54.239" style="s2">that even when we are together right</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.400" end="01:50:55.679" style="s2">i think daniel if i could just come back</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.239" end="01:50:59.440" style="s2">on back to my question</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.679" end="01:50:59.760" style="s2">on um i don&#39;t know what my question was</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.440" end="01:51:03.440" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="01:51:05.520" end="01:51:08.560" style="s2">saying now because</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.639" end="01:51:10.719" style="s2">i think behind my question i sort of got</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.560" end="01:51:12.320" style="s2">it into my head that somebody who&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.719" end="01:51:14.960" style="s2">of meta modern</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.320" end="01:51:15.920" style="s2">is likely to have a greater facility for</p>

<p begin="01:51:15.920" end="01:51:19.119" style="s2">operating at different levels engaging</p>

<p begin="01:51:22.719" end="01:51:26.960" style="s2">people who might come from you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.719" end="01:51:27.760" style="s2">different ends of the spectrum almost</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.960" end="01:51:29.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.760" end="01:51:31.679" style="s2">that cam in my personal experience that</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.760" end="01:51:32.880" style="s2">can be quite a dangerous situation i</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.679" end="01:51:34.880" style="s2">mean not that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.880" end="01:51:36.560" style="s2">setting myself up as the next messiah to</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.880" end="01:51:38.080" style="s2">be crucified but</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.560" end="01:51:40.639" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re kind of</p>

<p begin="01:51:40.639" end="01:51:46.719" style="s2">playing being in between for the sake of</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.239" end="01:51:48.080" style="s2">kind of sharing things that are going to</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.719" end="01:51:51.520" style="s2">be received by people</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.080" end="01:51:51.520" style="s2">it can be quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.800" end="01:52:01.119" style="s2">agreed but so are all other positions</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.040" end="01:52:04.239" style="s2">um so what we argue in</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.119" end="01:52:05.040" style="s2">the nordic ideology is that modernists</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.239" end="01:52:06.880" style="s2">are going to win</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.040" end="01:52:09.920" style="s2">in the long run and they&#39;re the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.880" end="01:52:13.360" style="s2">of populists because populists</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.920" end="01:52:15.280" style="s2">and they go for local complexity and</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.360" end="01:52:16.400" style="s2">thus towards the lowest common</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.280" end="01:52:18.960" style="s2">denominator</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.400" end="01:52:20.960" style="s2">so uh a lot of people are bothered by</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.960" end="01:52:23.040" style="s2">the presence of a lot of new arabs in</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.960" end="01:52:26.639" style="s2">swedish society so the populist party</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.040" end="01:52:30.159" style="s2">are going to say well how about not iris</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.639" end="01:52:32.400" style="s2">and yeah stuff like that right</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.159" end="01:52:33.840" style="s2">uh whereas metamodernists go in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.400" end="01:52:37.119" style="s2">opposite direction and say</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.840" end="01:52:39.119" style="s2">hey we&#39;re gonna do so complex stuff um</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.119" end="01:52:40.800" style="s2">and be so nuanced we&#39;re gonna bore you</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.119" end="01:52:43.520" style="s2">all to tears</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.800" end="01:52:44.400" style="s2">uh you&#39;re not gonna be wanting to listen</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.520" end="01:52:46.560" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.400" end="01:52:47.840" style="s2">so they&#39;ll always they&#39;ll always only</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.560" end="01:52:50.560" style="s2">attract uh</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.840" end="01:52:51.440" style="s2">in terms of votes versus popular support</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.560" end="01:52:55.280" style="s2">a lower</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.440" end="01:52:58.800" style="s2">uh a lower lower portion</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.280" end="01:53:00.639" style="s2">but because uh these processes</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.800" end="01:53:03.199" style="s2">that are created in that modern circles</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.639" end="01:53:03.199" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.360" end="01:53:06.560" style="s2">manage greater complexity they also</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.360" end="01:53:10.000" style="s2">manage to</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.560" end="01:53:13.199" style="s2">imbue more perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.000" end="01:53:13.520" style="s2">and then they can uh traverse what other</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.199" end="01:53:16.719" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.520" end="01:53:19.920" style="s2">others view as flat</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.719" end="01:53:21.040" style="s2">um scales or one-dimensional scales or</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.920" end="01:53:25.280" style="s2">two-dimensional scales</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.040" end="01:53:25.280" style="s2">and they can uh well</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.440" end="01:53:29.199" style="s2">walk through the third dimension and pop</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.360" end="01:53:33.679" style="s2">out on different places</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.199" end="01:53:37.280" style="s2">and as such they can have uh more</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.679" end="01:53:40.480" style="s2">weak ties and that&#39;s a powerful uh</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.280" end="01:53:41.360" style="s2">uh theory in network theory that weak</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.480" end="01:53:44.480" style="s2">ties</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.360" end="01:53:47.199" style="s2">can can help out a lot uh and</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.480" end="01:53:49.520" style="s2">in those weak ties they can always offer</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.199" end="01:53:51.360" style="s2">interesting counter perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.520" end="01:53:53.840" style="s2">so a person on the right will get</p>

<p begin="01:56:13.360" end="01:56:19.760" style="s2">but in accumulation</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.480" end="01:56:23.199" style="s2">canada will save the world right</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.760" end="01:56:24.639" style="s2">and but the middle class won&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.199" end="01:56:26.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to pay for that with</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.639" end="01:56:29.199" style="s2">their tax money in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.400" end="01:56:31.440" style="s2">ubi and so on and then there is an</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.199" end="01:56:33.679" style="s2">alliance and between</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.440" end="01:56:35.280" style="s2">metamodern is since the creative class</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.679" end="01:56:37.199" style="s2">but also the precariat</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.280" end="01:56:39.119" style="s2">the people who don&#39;t fit in and the</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.199" end="01:56:42.560" style="s2">categories of</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.119" end="01:56:46.320" style="s2">worker entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.560" end="01:56:47.520" style="s2">and and so on uh so there&#39;s of course a</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.320" end="01:56:49.520" style="s2">revolving door if you</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.520" end="01:56:51.599" style="s2">live a risky life for the creative class</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.520" end="01:56:55.920" style="s2">you can land a preterity it has happened</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.599" end="01:56:59.040" style="s2">a lot of us um and um</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.920" end="01:57:00.639" style="s2">and then what both of these groups need</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.040" end="01:57:02.000" style="s2">is a more listening society which</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.639" end="01:57:04.880" style="s2">empowers</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.000" end="01:57:05.679" style="s2">sovereignty and doesn&#39;t let you spend</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.880" end="01:57:09.040" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.679" end="01:57:09.520" style="s2">unemployed days uh you know making all</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.040" end="01:57:12.719" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.520" end="01:57:14.880" style="s2">applications uh and</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.719" end="01:57:16.719" style="s2">you know jumping in so many hoops from</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.880" end="01:57:20.880" style="s2">the from the authorities and</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.719" end="01:57:24.960" style="s2">and uh and the companies and</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.880" end="01:57:28.320" style="s2">so so uh i i do see</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.960" end="01:57:31.679" style="s2">a separate class interest there um</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.320" end="01:57:35.920" style="s2">which is orthogonal to to the</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.679" end="01:57:40.000" style="s2">to the classical scale and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.920" end="01:57:42.960" style="s2">before it has you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.000" end="01:57:44.480" style="s2">gotten its support structures it feels a</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.960" end="01:57:47.360" style="s2">lot more dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.480" end="01:57:49.360" style="s2">but actually it&#39;s one of the less</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.360" end="01:57:51.840" style="s2">dangerous positions in society</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.360" end="01:57:53.360" style="s2">because uh when push comes to shop and</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.840" end="01:57:56.000" style="s2">things uh</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.360" end="01:57:57.840" style="s2">there is a lot of turmoil uh we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.000" end="01:57:59.920" style="s2">uh allies and friends and perspectives a</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.840" end="01:58:03.679" style="s2">bit more all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.920" end="01:58:06.320" style="s2">um which i mean the chameleon is</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.679" end="01:58:06.960" style="s2">is often safe and the the the octopus is</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.320" end="01:58:09.119" style="s2">often safe</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.960" end="01:58:09.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.560" end="01:58:13.920" style="s2">yeah can i just ask you a bit more about</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.639" end="01:58:15.920" style="s2">the precarious</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.920" end="01:58:17.040" style="s2">that you mentioned that because i mean</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.920" end="01:58:20.000" style="s2">if you if you follow</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.040" end="01:58:22.080" style="s2">um guy standings analysis he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.000" end="01:58:23.040" style="s2">about the development of a kind of class</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.080" end="01:58:26.639" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.040" end="01:58:29.199" style="s2">there but but three very disparate</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.639" end="01:58:30.080" style="s2">groups in society in western society</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.199" end="01:58:32.400" style="s2">that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.080" end="01:58:34.880" style="s2">tend to be antagonistic towards each</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.400" end="01:58:37.520" style="s2">other so you&#39;ve got the descendants of</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.880" end="01:58:40.080" style="s2">the traditional working class you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.520" end="01:58:40.960" style="s2">ethnic minority immigrants and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.080" end="01:58:44.239" style="s2">also got</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.960" end="01:58:47.199" style="s2">kind of highly educated younger</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.239" end="01:58:48.880" style="s2">people who don&#39;t find any employment</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.199" end="01:58:50.560" style="s2">commensurate with a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.880" end="01:58:52.239" style="s2">you know their complete levels of</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.560" end="01:58:54.480" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.239" end="01:58:56.040" style="s2">so so what you&#39;re saying now about a</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.480" end="01:58:59.360" style="s2">kind of quadruple</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.040" end="01:58:59.840" style="s2">h class consciousness developing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.360" end="01:59:02.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.840" end="01:59:05.119" style="s2">interested to know how that would help</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.960" end="01:59:08.159" style="s2">what guy standings talking about in</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.119" end="01:59:10.159" style="s2">terms of engaging with the precarious</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.159" end="01:59:12.080" style="s2">yes so i realized we&#39;re on times i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.159" end="01:59:15.440" style="s2">have to uh respond</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.080" end="01:59:16.719" style="s2">very quickly uh but i&#39;m not a super fan</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.440" end="01:59:19.280" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.719" end="01:59:20.880" style="s2">of the chi stamina&#39;s precarious uh</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.280" end="01:59:21.599" style="s2">theory because i don&#39;t view it as</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.880" end="01:59:25.040" style="s2">realistic</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.599" end="01:59:28.320" style="s2">to the the fundamental um</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.040" end="01:59:31.119" style="s2">uh alliance as realistic</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.320" end="01:59:32.960" style="s2">um and and in fact since you published</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.119" end="01:59:35.440" style="s2">the book you haven&#39;t seen these uh</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.960" end="01:59:36.320" style="s2">this new dangerous class emerging really</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.440" end="01:59:39.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.320" end="01:59:42.960" style="s2">and what what you see in on the</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.840" end="01:59:45.440" style="s2">uh in the cop like</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.960" end="01:59:46.480" style="s2">what what my sociologists colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.440" end="01:59:50.560" style="s2">have studied in</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.480" end="01:59:53.119" style="s2">um and their protest studies and</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.560" end="01:59:54.960" style="s2">demonstration studies they see that</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.119" end="01:59:58.800" style="s2">young people show up at these</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.960" end="02:00:01.280" style="s2">protests and demonstrate what uh</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.800" end="02:00:03.520" style="s2">what we would call pomos the the</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.280" end="02:00:07.760" style="s2">postmodern population</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.520" end="02:00:11.599" style="s2">um and um i i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.760" end="02:00:14.639" style="s2">bit of a left-wing wet fantasy that um</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.599" end="02:00:15.840" style="s2">the working class would align with all</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.639" end="02:00:18.639" style="s2">of these new immigrants</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.840" end="02:00:20.560" style="s2">who are competing for the same jobs and</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.639" end="02:00:21.920" style="s2">at the same time their national identity</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.560" end="02:00:23.920" style="s2">being perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.920" end="02:00:26.320" style="s2">their primary source of pride that they</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.920" end="02:00:29.360" style="s2">still have if they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.320" end="02:00:32.320" style="s2">privileged in society</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.360" end="02:00:34.960" style="s2">and i also have difficulty seeing these</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.320" end="02:00:38.159" style="s2">very disparate groups that are the</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.960" end="02:00:42.080" style="s2">the immigrants organizing as</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.159" end="02:00:45.280" style="s2">such um they tend to organize</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.080" end="02:00:48.320" style="s2">according to the lines of ethnic uh</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.280" end="02:00:51.840" style="s2">ethnicities and so</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.320" end="02:00:55.520" style="s2">um what i mean rather</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.840" end="02:00:59.760" style="s2">is um that okay</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.520" end="02:01:02.639" style="s2">a lot of us work outside of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.760" end="02:01:03.199" style="s2">of the norms and the habits and</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.639" end="02:01:06.880" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.199" end="02:01:09.920" style="s2">of the the modern labor market</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.880" end="02:01:12.960" style="s2">and as such we have a shared</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.920" end="02:01:16.080" style="s2">interest with unemployed people</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.960" end="02:01:18.159" style="s2">and people who don&#39;t quite fit in and</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.080" end="02:01:19.199" style="s2">these this group in itself cannot</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.159" end="02:01:22.320" style="s2">organize itself</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.199" end="02:01:24.960" style="s2">for logical reasons because</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.320" end="02:01:26.880" style="s2">everybody wants to stop being unemployed</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.960" end="02:01:30.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.880" end="02:01:34.159" style="s2">skip out</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.239" end="02:01:38.159" style="s2">out of that out of that hole right</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.159" end="02:01:41.520" style="s2">so rather it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.159" end="02:01:42.800" style="s2">if uh metamodernists and the quadruple</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.520" end="02:01:44.800" style="s2">age population</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.800" end="02:01:46.000" style="s2">build a more listening society with</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.800" end="02:01:48.080" style="s2">basic uh</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.000" end="02:01:50.000" style="s2">support structures for everyone not</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.080" end="02:01:52.320" style="s2">necessarily ubi but other</p>

<p begin="02:01:52.320" end="02:01:56.880" style="s2">through all the modern hoops</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.159" end="02:01:58.000" style="s2">then there&#39;s likely to be a quiet</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.880" end="02:02:00.880" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.000" end="02:02:01.760" style="s2">from somewhere from well from the</p>

<p begin="02:02:11.760" end="02:02:16.560" style="s2">more people are</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.159" end="02:02:19.840" style="s2">falling into that category due to the</p>

<p begin="02:02:19.840" end="02:02:27.280" style="s2">and and of course digitization</p>
