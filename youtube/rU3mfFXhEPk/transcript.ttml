<p begin="00:00:24.340" end="00:00:28.570" style="s2">Joe has been associated with the New</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.230" end="00:00:31.210" style="s2">England complex systems Institute often</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.570" end="00:00:33.190" style="s2">identified by the acronym and the CSI</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.210" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">there&#39;s published articles with people</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.190" end="00:00:37.540" style="s2">there so he&#39;s another complexity guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">like me but I must confess I&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.540" end="00:00:41.890" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute bigot since I first</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:43.870" style="s2">read John Holland&#39;s adaptation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.890" end="00:00:46.329" style="s2">natural and artificial systems and soon</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.870" end="00:00:48.489" style="s2">thereafter Stuart Kaufman&#39;s origins of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.329" end="00:00:52.210" style="s2">order and truthfully I know relatively</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.489" end="00:00:53.980" style="s2">little about any CSI maybe Joe you could</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.210" end="00:00:56.829" style="s2">give us a short version of your at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.980" end="00:00:59.949" style="s2">academic life and tell us what Rita any</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.829" end="00:01:01.690" style="s2">CSI and what it&#39;s about sure absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.949" end="00:01:03.789" style="s2">so just to make it even easier we call</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.690" end="00:01:06.070" style="s2">it neck see neck fazer</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.789" end="00:01:07.480" style="s2">yup so it&#39;s very hard to say and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.070" end="00:01:09.850" style="s2">moderately hard to say and then easy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.480" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">say so neck see is good so I did my PhD</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.850" end="00:01:13.750" style="s2">at Florida Atlantic University at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">Center for complex systems and brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.750" end="00:01:18.520" style="s2">sciences there I studied self</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.520" end="00:01:23.500" style="s2">pattern formation all in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.490" end="00:01:25.540" style="s2">visual perception after that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.500" end="00:01:27.310" style="s2">really looking to expand the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.540" end="00:01:29.350" style="s2">what I was looking at and next he had</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.310" end="00:01:30.640" style="s2">caught my interest I had attended of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:32.649" style="s2">course there during grad school a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.640" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">two-week long course taught by uni</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.649" end="00:01:36.610" style="s2">herbarium who&#39;s the president and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:38.380" style="s2">founder as well as Hiroki syama who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.610" end="00:01:40.329" style="s2">now at Binghamton University and won a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:42.369" style="s2">very fine complex system scientist I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.329" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">will say and you know what really caught</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.369" end="00:01:47.500" style="s2">my eye about nexi was an attention to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:49.810" style="s2">real-world problems including</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.500" end="00:01:52.030" style="s2">engineering and design problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.810" end="00:01:53.710" style="s2">how complex systems not only is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.030" end="00:01:55.869" style="s2">an interesting way of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.710" end="00:01:57.880" style="s2">world but what it can actually do to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.869" end="00:02:00.189" style="s2">make differences for real problems that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.880" end="00:02:01.780" style="s2">people face so I headed up to nexi at</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.189" end="00:02:03.310" style="s2">that point spent a couple years there as</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:05.799" style="s2">a postdoc I&#39;m currently an affiliate</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.310" end="00:02:07.450" style="s2">there and I&#39;m also an instructor at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.799" end="00:02:10.240" style="s2">real-world risk institute and we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.450" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">have an acronym for that our WRI and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.240" end="00:02:14.100" style="s2">say raisa what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:15.569" style="s2">in there and that&#39;s Nassim Taleb school</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:18.030" style="s2">we run a three times a year at new york</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">city and i just do a few hours of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.030" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">lecturing there each time and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.770" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">another point of involvement with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">complex systems community and its</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:27.630" style="s2">application to real world issues it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.970" style="s2">would drew to the study of complexity as</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.630" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">we both know it&#39;s a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.970" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">field well actually I can say it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">runs in the family</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">my father worked for many years at mitre</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:40.020" style="s2">corporation and he kind of developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:41.819" style="s2">himself into and really he&#39;s a pioneer</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.020" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">in the field of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.819" end="00:02:45.630" style="s2">engineering so when I was a kid there</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">was always you know you mentioned Stu</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.630" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">Coffman for instance John Holland these</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">books were around when I was a kid and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">pick him up and look at them and read</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:54.570" style="s2">them kind of casually browse them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">you know I was much more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.570" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">skateboarding but it kind of started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:01.350" style="s2">sink in I think at that point as I got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">little older I started looking during</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.350" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">college at philosophy of mind and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:07.640" style="s2">drew me towards some systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">for instance of Francisco Varela</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.640" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">Humberto Maturana around Auto pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">obviously the sort of development of AI</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">from symbolic AI through connectionism</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">etc and really I started to link up all</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:21.959" style="s2">of those ideas what I was naturally kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">of pulled towards and these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.959" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">complexity and emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:27.269" style="s2">self-organization and so really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">connections start to light up for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.269" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">then and kind of just been gradual one</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">step at a time since then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">interesting how people take different</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">paths well my dad was a cop so I never</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">saw any of this kind of stuff right but</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:41.220" style="s2">in the later days of my business career</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">I stumbled on to it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:45.150" style="s2">story up you know little chance</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:47.430" style="s2">happenings change one&#39;s life I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:48.989" style="s2">see a one-paragraph little blurb in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.430" end="00:03:50.579" style="s2">Scientific American about something</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.989" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">called genetic algorithms what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.579" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">is that I say it sounds interesting let</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">me look it up I can&#39;t tell you the exact</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">date but it must have been within a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:03:59.130" style="s2">months of Amazon starting because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">think that one of the earliest books in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.130" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">my Amazon books ordered is adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:04.450" style="s2">and natural and artificial systems and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:06.310" style="s2">read that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.450" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">whoa is this quite interesting then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.310" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">found origins and order read that then</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">from there I kind of use that parallax</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">to discover the Santa Fe Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">kind of started drilling into that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">started using complexity thinking in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.320" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">business career particularly things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">co-evolutionary Fitness landscapes which</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:25.510" style="s2">actually turns out to be very useful in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">thinking about corporate growth and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.510" end="00:04:30.010" style="s2">particularly M&amp;A and then when I retired</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:31.720" style="s2">I started doing some work that came to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.010" end="00:04:33.250" style="s2">the attention of Santa Fe Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.720" end="00:04:35.139" style="s2">they invited me out there I was gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:37.210" style="s2">out for a year as a researcher and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.139" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">residents ended up staying 10 years and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.210" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">ended up as the chairman of the place</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:42.850" style="s2">you know weird things all from reading</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:44.950" style="s2">one paragraph in Scientific American and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.850" end="00:04:46.780" style="s2">as I hoped complexity science turned out</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.950" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">to be a deep enough domain to keep me</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.780" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">from going back to work that was my real</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:53.470" style="s2">fear right it&#39;s written enough to last a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">lifetime of course you know as we both</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.470" end="00:04:57.639" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of things that call</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:04:59.590" style="s2">themselves complexity science what do</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.639" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">you describe as a domain of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.590" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">science that you&#39;re interested in well</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:04.780" style="s2">as I said I&#39;m really interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:07.240" style="s2">idea of applied complexity science so</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.780" end="00:05:09.070" style="s2">not just the understanding of some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.240" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">the themes and features of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.070" end="00:05:13.330" style="s2">emergence self-realization etc but how</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:14.500" style="s2">do those actually impact our</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.330" end="00:05:16.030" style="s2">decision-making so you mentioned an</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.500" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">interesting one coevolution and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.030" end="00:05:19.990" style="s2">co-evolutionary Fitness landscapes so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:22.180" style="s2">how does coevolution for example fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.990" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">into how we structure organizations what</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.180" end="00:05:26.169" style="s2">does that mean for how we expect them to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:27.729" style="s2">work and so my current sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.169" end="00:05:29.260" style="s2">professional interest is addressing</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.729" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">those questions of ok how do we now go</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.260" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">apply but with respect to what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:35.410" style="s2">complexity science per se you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:37.419" style="s2">really stuck on that crystallised the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.410" end="00:05:40.060" style="s2">idea in my mind about what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.419" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">essential about either set of phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.060" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in or a system that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.770" end="00:05:45.550" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in or set of objects</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.210" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">whatever may be is that what&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.550" end="00:05:51.010" style="s2">what&#39;s essential about them isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">actually in the stuff that they&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.010" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">of as we usually think about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:56.289" style="s2">actually in the organization of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:05:57.580" style="s2">stuff and this started to really click</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.289" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">for me start to make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.580" end="00:06:00.550" style="s2">because you know sort of especially in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.229" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">the West I&#39;ll say we&#39;re very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.550" end="00:06:04.990" style="s2">exposed to reductionism almost as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">underlying where we treat as an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.990" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">assumption underlying all of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:09.380" style="s2">investigations the way we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:10.970" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.380" end="00:06:13.100" style="s2">and for me like I said it was really</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.970" end="00:06:15.170" style="s2">Coffman and is focused on organization I</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.100" end="00:06:17.060" style="s2">remember he for a time at least used a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.170" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">term propagation of organization that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.060" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">really stuck with me and it just lit up</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:24.320" style="s2">a light bulb in my mind where I said aha</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:25.730" style="s2">this is really the key they were keying</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.320" end="00:06:28.550" style="s2">in on something essential here what</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.730" end="00:06:30.650" style="s2">systems are and how they produce</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.550" end="00:06:33.290" style="s2">behaviors how they interact with other</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.650" end="00:06:35.090" style="s2">systems etc are all really about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.290" end="00:06:37.570" style="s2">patterns and these patterns exist at</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.090" end="00:06:39.890" style="s2">different scales so it&#39;s organization</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.570" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">organization is really important because</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.890" end="00:06:44.450" style="s2">it&#39;s about constraints and structure on</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:46.760" style="s2">interactions so complexity is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.450" end="00:06:48.920" style="s2">about the way interactions give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.760" end="00:06:50.540" style="s2">phenomena so these are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.920" end="00:06:52.250" style="s2">themes that really capture me and I find</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.540" end="00:06:54.530" style="s2">important and essential to understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.250" end="00:06:56.360" style="s2">the world and some of the more even</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.530" end="00:06:58.550" style="s2">currently edged thinking that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.360" end="00:07:00.470" style="s2">attracted to you know it&#39;s performed by</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.550" end="00:07:02.750" style="s2">folks like Chris Alexander another SFI</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:04.520" style="s2">guy where all of a sudden we have not</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.750" end="00:07:07.160" style="s2">only are we moving beyond reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.520" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">in terms of emergence of novel</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.160" end="00:07:12.260" style="s2">properties but also the way that whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:14.570" style="s2">systems say a single organism give rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.260" end="00:07:16.460" style="s2">to what we can kind of part out and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.570" end="00:07:18.790" style="s2">analyze as the parts of the system so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.460" end="00:07:21.670" style="s2">very much unlike the way we construct</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.790" end="00:07:24.410" style="s2">systems artificial systems often a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.670" end="00:07:26.870" style="s2">organic and growing complex system</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.410" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">develops and will actually synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.870" end="00:07:31.940" style="s2">its own components functional components</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">etc and this is very much beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.940" end="00:07:36.710" style="s2">reductionism as a philosophy can really</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">speak to and so I feel like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.710" end="00:07:41.480" style="s2">really where the edge of the thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:43.550" style="s2">is how do we now not only have emergent</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.480" end="00:07:45.470" style="s2">properties but how do we have things</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.550" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">like functional properties say in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.470" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">organ of an organism arising out of not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">only that piece of the system but that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.750" style="s2">piece and how it relates to the context</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:55.550" style="s2">that gave rise to it and I just feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.750" end="00:07:57.350" style="s2">that we&#39;re only at the beginning really</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.550" end="00:07:59.480" style="s2">of grappling with that kind of a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.350" end="00:08:01.310" style="s2">great I love it I think we must have</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.480" end="00:08:04.100" style="s2">come in through a very similar door</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.310" end="00:08:06.650" style="s2">because the simple metaphor I used for</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.100" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">people back home to explain complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:11.930" style="s2">versus reductionism as I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:14.330" style="s2">study of the dancer is reductionism the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.930" end="00:08:16.430" style="s2">study of the dance is complexity oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.330" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">that&#39;s nice that&#39;s nice and I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">like that because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:24.539" style="s2">is something that is kind of playful its</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:26.970" style="s2">organic it&#39;s not a recipe it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.539" end="00:08:28.770" style="s2">structure but it&#39;s not sort of pre</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.970" end="00:08:30.060" style="s2">formulated and I think that&#39;s so much of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.770" end="00:08:32.219" style="s2">what we experience the world is really</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.060" end="00:08:34.919" style="s2">the spontaneous kind of cult sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.219" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">game playing or dancing and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.919" end="00:08:38.430" style="s2">really have a great handle on that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:41.219" style="s2">in fact even the sort of structure of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.430" end="00:08:42.899" style="s2">formal systems proper don&#39;t play well in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.219" end="00:08:45.570" style="s2">a crucial way with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.899" end="00:08:47.910" style="s2">spontaneous playfulness that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.570" end="00:08:50.190" style="s2">observe in the world and even built</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.910" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">systems that involve humans have that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.190" end="00:08:53.670" style="s2">attribute even if the designers didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:08:55.649" style="s2">intend them to because humans are wilful</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.670" end="00:08:57.300" style="s2">little sons of bitches right I worked in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.649" end="00:09:00.120" style="s2">corporate America much of my life half</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">startups and half big corporations and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.120" end="00:09:04.380" style="s2">would always tell every new CEO you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:07.020" style="s2">all those buttons and levers that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.380" end="00:09:09.029" style="s2">theoretically on your desk most of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.020" end="00:09:10.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t connected anything right you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.029" end="00:09:11.820" style="s2">press all those buttons pull those</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.440" end="00:09:13.589" style="s2">levers not a goddamn thing will happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.820" end="00:09:15.240" style="s2">because the corporate equivalent of deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.589" end="00:09:17.339" style="s2">state will keep on doing what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.240" end="00:09:19.950" style="s2">and its own self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.339" end="00:09:21.779" style="s2">self-interested agency risk fashion and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.950" end="00:09:23.700" style="s2">if they do manage to do anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.779" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">as you mentioned most likely whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.700" end="00:09:26.310" style="s2">those consequences are will be</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:28.890" style="s2">unintended ones as opposed to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.310" end="00:09:31.010" style="s2">that executive imagined the effect would</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.890" end="00:09:33.240" style="s2">be so we just have so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.010" end="00:09:35.430" style="s2">interdependencies and then subtle</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.240" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">effects and variables and unidentified</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.430" end="00:09:39.510" style="s2">relevant variables etc so when you pull</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">on that lever you think a is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.510" end="00:09:43.560" style="s2">happen and maybe it happens maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:46.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen but you often get XY and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.560" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2">Z instead indeed the other topic you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.020" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">mentions one that&#39;s also of considerable</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:51.060" style="s2">interest to me I will say I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.500" end="00:09:53.339" style="s2">expert in it I probably do need to read</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.060" end="00:09:54.990" style="s2">more on it and this is this as you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.339" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">cutting edge thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.990" end="00:10:02.040" style="s2">distinctions between holes and their</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">components some people I use a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.040" end="00:10:07.560" style="s2">which to my mind is still a little hazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:10.230" style="s2">downward causality that somehow the hole</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.560" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">creates an ecosystem and environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.230" end="00:10:13.770" style="s2">that supports the existence of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:15.420" style="s2">I think actually the reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.770" end="00:10:17.379" style="s2">something even more strange than that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.420" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">but have you heard of the term down</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.379" end="00:10:20.799" style="s2">causality if you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:22.509" style="s2">that oh yeah absolutely I mean downward</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.799" end="00:10:24.579" style="s2">causation exactly this is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.509" end="00:10:27.039" style="s2">grapple with this issue of well if</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.579" end="00:10:29.349" style="s2">emergence is not merely epistemic but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.039" end="00:10:31.359" style="s2">some sense an to logic then what does it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.349" end="00:10:33.369" style="s2">mean when we say something new emerges</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.359" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">is it somehow contradicting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.369" end="00:10:36.369" style="s2">lower-level properties if not everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:37.899" style="s2">is arising from them so downward</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.369" end="00:10:40.509" style="s2">causation is an attempt to start to deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.899" end="00:10:42.819" style="s2">with that problem now I also have had I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.509" end="00:10:45.039" style="s2">don&#39;t have any strong feelings on</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.819" end="00:10:46.329" style="s2">downward causation except I wonder if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.039" end="00:10:47.949" style="s2">is the right frame and I actually really</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.329" end="00:10:51.699" style="s2">like the way you framed it with respect</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.949" end="00:10:54.339" style="s2">to sort of a a novel domain emerges that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.699" end="00:10:55.869" style="s2">supports new dynamics that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.339" end="00:10:58.089" style="s2">present otherwise without that domain</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.869" end="00:10:59.859" style="s2">now is that sort of top causing bottom</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.089" end="00:11:01.059" style="s2">maybe maybe that&#39;s not the right way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.859" end="00:11:02.739" style="s2">think about though maybe it&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.059" end="00:11:04.749" style="s2">emergent constraints and then from those</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.739" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">constraints you can get novel structures</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.349" end="00:11:11.949" style="s2">think it&#39;s at that edge that I was</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.949" end="00:11:16.359" style="s2">one kind of key word call it that sort</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.359" end="00:11:20.049" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if anyone has done work</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.549" end="00:11:22.509" style="s2">that&#39;s very convincing on that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.049" end="00:11:24.429" style="s2">there&#39;s a fellow Eric Cole who has done</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.509" end="00:11:26.529" style="s2">some work about using the idea of error</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.609" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">really captured the essence and I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.499" end="00:11:37.629" style="s2">like again what you said in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:40.029" style="s2">developing and emerging domain that then</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.629" end="00:11:41.499" style="s2">enables novel dynamics to happen I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.029" end="00:11:43.209" style="s2">you think of something like Turing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.499" end="00:11:45.189" style="s2">morphogenesis patterns right tearing</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.209" end="00:11:46.600" style="s2">patterns and you know Turing was really</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.189" end="00:11:49.119" style="s2">onto something with that no doubt about</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.600" end="00:11:52.299" style="s2">it but what it leaves out is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.119" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">that the media that those patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.299" end="00:11:57.069" style="s2">occurring on in biological systems is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:59.199" style="s2">actually provided by the organism itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.069" end="00:12:01.689" style="s2">so when the skin se develops into</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.199" end="00:12:02.799" style="s2">stripes on a fish those stripes and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.689" end="00:12:04.509" style="s2">development those stripes can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.799" end="00:12:07.359" style="s2">somewhat accounted for at least by</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.509" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">reaction diffusion systems things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.359" end="00:12:11.139" style="s2">that you can think of it as but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">this kind of interesting causal loop</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.139" end="00:12:15.009" style="s2">where yes but it&#39;s the organism</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:17.649" style="s2">developing that&#39;s generating the domain</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.009" end="00:12:19.209" style="s2">for those Turing patterns so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.649" end="00:12:21.009" style="s2">something we&#39;re not quite capturing when</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.209" end="00:12:22.539" style="s2">we say just look at Turing patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.009" end="00:12:24.459" style="s2">fact I have some unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.539" end="00:12:26.319" style="s2">unpublished and that&#39;s just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.459" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">priority stack issue but unpublished</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.319" end="00:12:29.420" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing to actually deal with</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:31.280" style="s2">some of that issue and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.420" end="00:12:33.950" style="s2">you can think of nested layers of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.280" end="00:12:36.050" style="s2">pattern formation where say a bounded</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.950" end="00:12:38.120" style="s2">organism is forming and creating</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.050" end="00:12:40.010" style="s2">conditions for other sort of sub</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.120" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">patterns to be generated within that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.010" end="00:12:44.270" style="s2">domain I also think it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:46.730" style="s2">one&#39;s head around until one thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.270" end="00:12:48.380" style="s2">temporal depth right particularly with</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.730" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">respect to natural systems I think one</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.380" end="00:12:51.560" style="s2">of the truest statements about biology</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">is nothing makes sense in biology</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.560" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">without respect to evolution and so if</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.410" end="00:12:59.240" style="s2">we think about the whole providing an</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:01.370" style="s2">ecosystem that has some degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:03.890" style="s2">freedom for evolution to work in we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.370" end="00:13:06.680" style="s2">start thinking about this whole in parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.890" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">coevolution essentially right so you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.680" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">look a series of generations don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">at a static developmental framework in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">short period of time but rather you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:15.140" style="s2">multiple generations you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:17.150" style="s2">provides some degrees of freedom for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.140" end="00:13:19.160" style="s2">internal parts you know person&#39;s liver</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.150" end="00:13:20.900" style="s2">can be bigger or smaller without killing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.160" end="00:13:23.900" style="s2">them though it probably had some impact</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.900" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">on their phenotypic afib Nisour so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.900" end="00:13:27.650" style="s2">know there&#39;s some changes at the top</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:29.330" style="s2">let&#39;s say the organism and all of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.650" end="00:13:31.910" style="s2">components including its brain and its</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.330" end="00:13:33.800" style="s2">social systems discover a new way eating</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.910" end="00:13:35.270" style="s2">right or find a new food that&#39;s richer</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.800" end="00:13:37.310" style="s2">in things that are good for the liver</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.270" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">and so the liver can get smaller and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.310" end="00:13:41.480" style="s2">less of our energy is spent on liver</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:44.150" style="s2">function and more can be spent on brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.480" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">function so you have over a time depth</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.150" end="00:13:49.190" style="s2">you have a very interesting coevolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:51.140" style="s2">going on between the phenotypical full</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:53.750" style="s2">organism level and its structural</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.140" end="00:13:55.430" style="s2">components that&#39;s absolutely true and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.750" end="00:13:58.430" style="s2">you know one of the things that Kaufmann</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.430" end="00:14:00.350" style="s2">really hammers home is that these sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.430" end="00:14:02.660" style="s2">of functional roles that different</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.350" end="00:14:05.000" style="s2">structures play over that evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.660" end="00:14:06.740" style="s2">time are pretty fluid in in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.000" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">that just because a structure plays</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.740" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">function a today doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">couldn&#39;t play some other function</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:14.870" style="s2">tomorrow and a striking example of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:17.630" style="s2">is the jaw bone in our long distant</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.870" end="00:14:20.300" style="s2">lizard-like ancestors at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.630" end="00:14:22.250" style="s2">evolution it began to become perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.300" end="00:14:24.230" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure but perhaps vestigial in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.250" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">the sense that it became small and not</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.230" end="00:14:27.740" style="s2">responsible for articulating the jaw</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.820" end="00:14:30.020" style="s2">anymore and there was another bone that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.740" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">evolved that did serve that function but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.020" end="00:14:33.890" style="s2">the structures didn&#39;t disappear what</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:34.610" style="s2">they did is migrated towards the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.890" end="00:14:36.829" style="s2">where our in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.610" end="00:14:38.750" style="s2">year now exists and became our inner ear</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.829" end="00:14:41.029" style="s2">bones that allow us to transduce</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.750" end="00:14:42.769" style="s2">pressure waves into nerve impulses</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.029" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">otherwise known as hearing so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.769" end="00:14:47.149" style="s2">something that was once for the mouth to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:49.610" style="s2">open and close became later for hearing</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.149" end="00:14:51.320" style="s2">which seemed worlds apart yet evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.610" end="00:14:53.029" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mind it will kind of grab what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.320" end="00:14:55.430" style="s2">available and through that process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.029" end="00:14:57.740" style="s2">coevolution discover really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.430" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2">novel functional purposes and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.740" end="00:15:00.589" style="s2">something of practical import so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.300" end="00:15:02.899" style="s2">mentioned that you found coevolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.589" end="00:15:05.000" style="s2">really useful for thinking about state</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.899" end="00:15:07.190" style="s2">organizations and this is because things</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.000" end="00:15:09.110" style="s2">like this can emerge and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.190" end="00:15:11.329" style="s2">something that anyone would necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.110" end="00:15:13.310" style="s2">imagine they&#39;re not necessarily even</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.329" end="00:15:14.649" style="s2">priests a de belen in terms of state</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.310" end="00:15:17.570" style="s2">space which is a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.649" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">possibility so exactly right unless we</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.570" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">look at the fullness of time we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:23.180" style="s2">really have a good handle on these</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:24.620" style="s2">things so I guess another piece is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.180" end="00:15:26.450" style="s2">sort of hinted at it but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.620" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">essential for me to think about complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.450" end="00:15:30.890" style="s2">systems is that we&#39;re always really</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">facing patterns that exist at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.890" end="00:15:34.130" style="s2">scales so that&#39;s multiple spatial scales</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">that&#39;s also certainly multiple time</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.130" end="00:15:38.630" style="s2">scales so that functional fluidity I</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">think is huge and it also speaks to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.630" end="00:15:43.190" style="s2">way we think about engineering say in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:45.949" style="s2">terms of imagine someone engineering the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.190" end="00:15:46.970" style="s2">organism that became us and at some</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.949" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">point they said I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.970" end="00:15:51.410" style="s2">understand what these old jaw bones are</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">doing so let&#39;s actually optimize them</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.410" end="00:15:54.350" style="s2">right out and make this system much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.050" style="s2">optimal because it&#39;s wasting resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.350" end="00:15:58.940" style="s2">and well you know if that had happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.050" end="00:16:01.640" style="s2">then we would have missed the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.940" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">opportunity to hear yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.640" end="00:16:06.529" style="s2">it turns out my actual deep scientific</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:09.470" style="s2">expertise is in evolutionary computation</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.529" end="00:16:11.449" style="s2">and we see this all the time and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.470" end="00:16:13.760" style="s2">say genetic programming right if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.449" end="00:16:16.459" style="s2">don&#39;t manage your genetic program which</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.760" end="00:16:18.380" style="s2">is essentially a way to evolve programs</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.459" end="00:16:20.269" style="s2">right you start with sort of random</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.380" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2">programs and you do cross over a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.269" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">mutation you get better programs to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:26.209" style="s2">solve problems and you can quickly get</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.930" end="00:16:29.390" style="s2">bloat where you get lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.209" end="00:16:31.160" style="s2">what seems like dead code and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.390" end="00:16:32.630" style="s2">there are optimization algorithms one</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.160" end="00:16:34.730" style="s2">can do in fact you can actually just put</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.630" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">a very heavy tax on length and that will</p>

<p begin="00:17:05.270" end="00:17:08.539" style="s2">working on that that&#39;s really cool stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.770" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">and you know as you talk about it the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.539" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">thing that comes to my mind is okay so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of the temptation is to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">well maybe there&#39;s kind of a sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">for that variety you know like you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:19.579" style="s2">if it&#39;s too much blow to just cogging</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">your resources if it&#39;s not enough it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:38.690" style="s2">support of upload so you kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:41.179" style="s2">variety and then met a variety you might</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.690" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">say and so all of these ideas I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.179" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">are so essential for how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">build systems into the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">because we&#39;re pretty much beyond the</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:05.779" style="s2">gonna think out loud here which is</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.029" end="00:18:13.429" style="s2">thinking right when you say diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.940" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">bloat what that actually means is</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.429" end="00:18:19.669" style="s2">probably the lack of tightness in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:21.289" style="s2">ecosystem typically and let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.669" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">natural system and then I&#39;ll give you</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:58.879" style="s2">would conceptually be okay right at a</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.399" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">running the experiments I&#39;d love to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:00.980" style="s2">a look and then talk about them and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.820" end="00:20:03.080" style="s2">know I guess the challenge is and once</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.080" end="00:20:06.259" style="s2">a limb here and I would need to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.580" end="00:20:08.450" style="s2">about it more to have confidence but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.259" end="00:20:11.450" style="s2">almost wonder if the question itself is</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.450" end="00:20:16.190" style="s2">know how much bloat</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.190" end="00:20:18.440" style="s2">this problem deserves so to speak and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.190" end="00:20:20.179" style="s2">wonder if we can answer that a priori in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.440" end="00:20:22.850" style="s2">any reasonable fashion I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.179" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">into it in many cases kind of where that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.850" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">balance might be struck but whether it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:28.669" style="s2">can be solved once for all I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:31.309" style="s2">I&#39;m actually quite strong on that you</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.760" end="00:22:14.660" style="s2">irreducibility necessarily but rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.530" end="00:22:16.490" style="s2">the general concept of irreducibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.660" end="00:22:18.650" style="s2">and what I mean by that is you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.490" end="00:22:20.030" style="s2">have for instance a a very specific kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.650" end="00:22:22.040" style="s2">of irreducibility such as computational</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.030" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">irreducibility that Stephen Wolfram</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.470" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">about essentially any process that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.380" end="00:22:40.460" style="s2">computable in that framework and in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">frame a reducibility can sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.460" end="00:22:45.169" style="s2">summarized by saying well there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:53.570" style="s2">you have to go through every step so</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:55.370" style="s2">everything in the in his world is</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.370" end="00:23:00.500" style="s2">automata deterministic nevertheless even</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:03.110" style="s2">with all that determinism in the system</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.500" end="00:23:04.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no concise sort of compressible</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.110" end="00:23:07.820" style="s2">formula to say well what will happen at</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.940" end="00:23:10.070" style="s2">time 1 billion or 10 billion or ever it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.820" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">is so it&#39;s irreducible in the sense that</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.890" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">happened</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.289" style="s2">no shortcut so that&#39;s sort of a summary</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.279" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">of computational irreducibility but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.289" end="00:23:23.529" style="s2">really gets at this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:27.159" style="s2">irreducibility more generally which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.529" end="00:23:30.399" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s no further amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.159" end="00:23:33.639" style="s2">you can deconstruct the system into</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.399" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">smaller pieces or fundamental laws or</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.639" end="00:23:39.159" style="s2">something like that that allows one to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:42.039" style="s2">impress the system further say sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.159" end="00:23:45.100" style="s2">compress it to something a redundant</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.100" end="00:23:47.740" style="s2">allows one to kind of project in time or</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:54.130" style="s2">how will it behave and so I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.510" end="00:23:56.409" style="s2">comes up in other places like in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.130" end="00:23:59.649" style="s2">cybernetics irreducibility has to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.409" end="00:24:02.169" style="s2">with essentially matrices and whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.649" end="00:24:03.669" style="s2">they can be broken down their machine</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.169" end="00:24:05.590" style="s2">can be broken down into smaller sub</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.669" end="00:24:07.419" style="s2">components that behave independently so</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.590" end="00:24:08.889" style="s2">that&#39;s the general idea and I just like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.419" end="00:24:11.889" style="s2">the term irreducibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.889" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">because it really puts emphasis on that</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.850" end="00:28:12.650" style="s2">compost collects and and it&#39;s uphill and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.310" end="00:28:14.420" style="s2">that&#39;s useful because you know until we</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.650" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">collect the compost to spread somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.420" end="00:28:18.890" style="s2">intentionally it&#39;s now running down the</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.390" end="00:28:31.730" style="s2">have designed but they&#39;re emerging out</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.730" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">over time yep that&#39;s really entering and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.010" end="00:28:39.170" style="s2">just as an interesting isn&#39;t the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:40.160" style="s2">strange I originally ran across Joe and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.170" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">a friend of mine said hey you oughta</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.160" end="00:28:44.150" style="s2">talk to Joe Norman he&#39;s a smart guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:46.130" style="s2">interested in local agriculture I had no</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.150" end="00:28:48.110" style="s2">idea it was a complexity dude how about</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.130" end="00:28:49.730" style="s2">that it&#39;s a beautiful intersection</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.110" end="00:28:51.740" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough of it there is some</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.730" end="00:28:53.900" style="s2">and especially in when you do start to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.740" end="00:28:55.610" style="s2">look into the local AG even without it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.900" end="00:28:57.920" style="s2">being explicitly called out so many of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.610" end="00:28:59.630" style="s2">the insights of complexity are embedded</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.920" end="00:29:01.370" style="s2">in there and you know for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.630" end="00:29:04.850" style="s2">permaculture and some of these other</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.370" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">philosophies we had Joel Salatin out at</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.850" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">the Santa Fe Institute one time that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:10.220" style="s2">quite interesting I loved you all I&#39;ll I</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:11.750" style="s2">mean I haven&#39;t met him in person but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.220" end="00:29:13.220" style="s2">love his writing so that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.750" end="00:29:14.780" style="s2">that must have been fun Joel&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.220" end="00:29:15.920" style="s2">neighbor we live close to Joel we know</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.780" end="00:29:18.170" style="s2">reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.920" end="00:29:20.930" style="s2">run into him fairly frequently so he is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.170" end="00:29:23.420" style="s2">an amazing character a true American</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.930" end="00:29:25.370" style="s2">innovator in his books are well worth</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.420" end="00:29:26.780" style="s2">reading my favorite is everything I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.370" end="00:29:29.180" style="s2">to do is illegal</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.780" end="00:29:31.250" style="s2">great title and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.180" end="00:29:33.530" style="s2">interesting book and he is right at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.250" end="00:29:35.510" style="s2">cutting edge of helping to rethink what</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.530" end="00:29:37.880" style="s2">local agriculture might actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.510" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">though I will say we did not really</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.880" end="00:29:42.710" style="s2">successfully inoculate him with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:44.030" style="s2">complexity virus but it maybe helped us</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.710" end="00:29:45.830" style="s2">perceptions a little bit he certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.030" end="00:29:48.110" style="s2">helped our perceptions a little bit by</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.830" end="00:29:50.540" style="s2">bring in more practice oriented things</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.110" end="00:29:52.400" style="s2">you know more in the applied space I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.540" end="00:29:54.170" style="s2">gonna jump here a little bit when I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.400" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">preparing for this I liked their prepare</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.170" end="00:29:57.650" style="s2">5 to 10 hours for each guest and one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:29:59.870" style="s2">the things I ran across was your</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.650" end="00:30:01.850" style="s2">dissertation and I read that with</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.870" end="00:30:04.760" style="s2">considerable interest that was on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.850" end="00:30:06.050" style="s2">perception of objects in motion and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.760" end="00:30:08.120" style="s2">particularly liked the fact the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.050" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">irreverence one of my favorite cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.120" end="00:30:11.660" style="s2">scientists who actually sort of became</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:14.690" style="s2">an anti cognitive scientists later</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.660" end="00:30:16.070" style="s2">JJ Gibson if you&#39;re up to it maybe talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.690" end="00:30:17.450" style="s2">a little bit about you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.070" end="00:30:19.640" style="s2">learned in doing the work for your</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">dissertation oh yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.640" end="00:30:24.770" style="s2">yeah so JJ Gibson is wonderful he is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:26.530" style="s2">you know his most famous book is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.770" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">ecological approach to visual perception</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.530" end="00:30:31.820" style="s2">what he means by ecological is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:32.900" style="s2">necessarily the way you think of ecology</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.820" end="00:30:35.240" style="s2">in terms of all we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.900" end="00:30:38.420" style="s2">interactions of organisms like that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.240" end="00:30:40.580" style="s2">the fact that the living human or any</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.420" end="00:30:43.550" style="s2">living organism with vision in this case</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.580" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">is embedded within an ecological system</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.550" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">and that has some profound implications</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:49.910" style="s2">for how we think about perception you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:52.610" style="s2">know one of his key concepts is this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.910" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">idea of affordance and an affordance is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.610" end="00:30:59.660" style="s2">a we could call it an atom of perception</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:02.120" style="s2">that is action-oriented or implies some</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.660" end="00:31:04.430" style="s2">set of possibilities for action so his</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.120" end="00:31:05.810" style="s2">idea is we don&#39;t perceive abstract</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.430" end="00:31:07.730" style="s2">physical properties of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.810" end="00:31:10.850" style="s2">we&#39;re not gathering census data to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.730" end="00:31:12.680" style="s2">reconstruct a kind of physical theory of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.850" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">what&#39;s out there but rather what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:17.330" style="s2">doing is picking up opportunities for us</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">to act on the environment or within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.330" end="00:31:22.400" style="s2">environment so you might think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:24.800" style="s2">something like a branch is graspable and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.400" end="00:31:26.509" style="s2">so you don&#39;t see that the branch is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.800" end="00:31:27.769" style="s2">know approximately cylindrical</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.509" end="00:31:30.349" style="s2">something like that you see no I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.769" end="00:31:32.539" style="s2">actually grab that with my hand and pull</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.349" end="00:31:35.469" style="s2">on it and pull myself up this tree so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.539" end="00:31:37.549" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very much an action-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.469" end="00:31:40.249" style="s2">heuristic kind of you might think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.549" end="00:31:43.190" style="s2">base idea of perception and what this</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.249" end="00:31:45.859" style="s2">really starts to draw out is that what</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.190" end="00:31:47.899" style="s2">we think of as perception is really a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.859" end="00:31:48.979" style="s2">relational property so we often again</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.899" end="00:31:51.469" style="s2">from from this kind of Western</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.979" end="00:31:53.299" style="s2">reductionist to Canon think of okay we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.469" end="00:31:55.669" style="s2">have a brain and inside that brain we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.299" end="00:31:56.959" style="s2">modeling the world out there but when</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.669" end="00:31:59.299" style="s2">you think about what does it mean for a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.959" end="00:32:01.249" style="s2">branch say to be graspable well now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.299" end="00:32:02.599" style="s2">invoking the structure of the organism</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.249" end="00:32:04.369" style="s2">itself as well because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.599" end="00:32:05.989" style="s2">relationship between say the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.369" end="00:32:07.429" style="s2">branch and the size of a hands that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.989" end="00:32:11.149" style="s2">grip it these are some of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.429" end="00:32:13.219" style="s2">JJ Gibson introduced and are so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.149" end="00:32:15.499" style="s2">and really can affect the way you look</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.219" end="00:32:17.809" style="s2">at the interaction of organism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.499" end="00:32:19.489" style="s2">environment and what it means for an</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.809" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">organism to be structured and what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.489" end="00:32:23.779" style="s2">means for the experience and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:25.669" style="s2">perception of the organism and this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.779" end="00:32:28.129" style="s2">also related to ideas of like um felt</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.669" end="00:32:30.589" style="s2">like a like an animal or a species as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.129" end="00:32:33.379" style="s2">certain kind of life world that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.589" end="00:32:35.119" style="s2">inhabit and that life world is with</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.379" end="00:32:37.249" style="s2">respect to the structure of the organism</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.119" end="00:32:39.799" style="s2">itself now how this worked into my</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.249" end="00:32:42.229" style="s2">dissertation I actually in large part</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.799" end="00:32:45.139" style="s2">included JJ Gibson in my dissertation as</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.229" end="00:32:47.329" style="s2">a nod to where I felt I fell short which</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.139" end="00:32:49.699" style="s2">is I did a lot of psychophysical</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.329" end="00:32:52.279" style="s2">experimentation looking at perception of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.699" end="00:32:54.679" style="s2">motion of folks sitting and looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.279" end="00:32:56.209" style="s2">computer screen and having some frames</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.679" end="00:32:58.339" style="s2">flash and asking them if they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.209" end="00:33:00.379" style="s2">discern shapes what they saw with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.339" end="00:33:02.149" style="s2">respect to patterns of motion and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.379" end="00:33:04.099" style="s2">think I uncovered some really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.149" end="00:33:07.009" style="s2">things doing that but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.099" end="00:33:10.279" style="s2">there was an ever-present awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.009" end="00:33:11.989" style="s2">this is not like an ecological setting</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.279" end="00:33:14.269" style="s2">there&#39;s something much different about</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.989" end="00:33:15.949" style="s2">sitting in a testing room looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.269" end="00:33:18.679" style="s2">computer screen and answering questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.949" end="00:33:21.109" style="s2">now I will say that to do justice to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.679" end="00:33:23.509" style="s2">that setting that is itself an</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.109" end="00:33:25.669" style="s2">ecological setting of a kind but one</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.509" end="00:33:27.859" style="s2">needs to always maintain the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.669" end="00:33:29.839" style="s2">that that is a very specific a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.859" end="00:33:32.269" style="s2">special setting and not a general</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.839" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">setting and there are in fact some</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.269" end="00:33:36.379" style="s2">features of more general settings that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">might be important to and certainly are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.379" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">important to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:42.280" style="s2">what I was discovering really is</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">important or not important perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.280" end="00:33:46.630" style="s2">ecological perception so what I looked</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:48.190" style="s2">at was the way that looks at several</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.630" end="00:33:50.050" style="s2">things but for instance the way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.190" end="00:33:52.180" style="s2">certain patterns visual patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.050" end="00:33:54.400" style="s2">multi stable so you can show the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.180" end="00:33:56.050" style="s2">pattern to either different people or</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.400" end="00:33:58.360" style="s2">the same person at different times and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.050" end="00:34:00.730" style="s2">what they perceive is different one time</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.360" end="00:34:03.100" style="s2">versus another so we looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.730" end="00:34:05.050" style="s2">dynamics of that we looked at some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.100" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">the older literature we spoke to in</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.050" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">psychophysics that did some poor</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:10.690" style="s2">statistics frankly and assume some</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">things that were not quite right should</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.690" end="00:34:14.139" style="s2">know there&#39;s different kinds of visual</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:16.750" style="s2">information that people are using for</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.139" end="00:34:19.120" style="s2">different kinds of processes and really</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.750" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">showed that the response is quite a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.120" end="00:34:26.530" style="s2">nonlinear one and you can capture a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">of very different seeming stimuli with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.530" end="00:34:30.850" style="s2">concise model and i/o at design model to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:32.919" style="s2">a dynamical neural network into showed</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.850" end="00:34:34.870" style="s2">that a very generic pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.919" end="00:34:37.210" style="s2">interaction among the neurons in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.870" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">neural network exposed to patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.210" end="00:34:42.700" style="s2">looked a lot like I&#39;ll say very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">close to what people perceive across</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.700" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">these patterns and that connected it to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:49.030" style="s2">the old psychology with respect to sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:50.230" style="s2">of perceptual principles and embody</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.030" end="00:34:52.899" style="s2">those principles is something a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.230" end="00:34:54.760" style="s2">more hard coded say in a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.899" end="00:34:56.740" style="s2">and computational model yeah I found it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.760" end="00:35:00.270" style="s2">very interesting because my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.740" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">single personal project is building a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.270" end="00:35:05.710" style="s2">rudimentary conscious cognition embedded</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:08.650" style="s2">in an ecosystem modeled on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.710" end="00:35:10.660" style="s2">white-tailed deer and I used Gibson as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.650" end="00:35:13.720" style="s2">significant part of my inspiration I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.660" end="00:35:15.700" style="s2">thought of what you were doing as the if</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.720" end="00:35:16.930" style="s2">it&#39;s true well someday maybe find out as</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.700" end="00:35:19.060" style="s2">one of the building blocks on which</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.930" end="00:35:20.860" style="s2">these phenomena are built so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.060" end="00:35:22.660" style="s2">specify down at that level I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.860" end="00:35:24.850" style="s2">at a higher level and I assume something</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.660" end="00:35:28.270" style="s2">like that is going on which delivers</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.850" end="00:35:30.280" style="s2">into the global work space objects and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.270" end="00:35:32.110" style="s2">set of affordances which are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.280" end="00:35:34.810" style="s2">discovered over time relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.110" end="00:35:36.550" style="s2">motion etc and so it was like right</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.810" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">next-door neighbor of the work that I do</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.550" end="00:35:40.220" style="s2">and I said wow you know I wish I&#39;d read</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:41.930" style="s2">this when I first started working on it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.220" end="00:35:43.700" style="s2">might have built a little bit more down</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.930" end="00:35:46.280" style="s2">in that direction oh that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.700" end="00:35:48.109" style="s2">you know there&#39;s two directions that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.280" end="00:35:50.569" style="s2">I had continued on that particular path</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.109" end="00:35:52.280" style="s2">I was planning to pursue and things just</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.569" end="00:35:54.440" style="s2">change and I didn&#39;t put any more time</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.280" end="00:35:56.329" style="s2">into them but one was indeed that okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.440" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">let&#39;s start embedding this in Asians</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.329" end="00:35:59.720" style="s2">that are in an environment and exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:02.510" style="s2">that so let&#39;s start to see if they can</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.720" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">discover affordances the other was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.510" end="00:36:06.619" style="s2">fact that I&#39;ve looked at these things so</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">often that I became very good at</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.619" end="00:36:11.240" style="s2">controlling what I was perceiving so</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:12.740" style="s2">most of the subjects were sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.240" end="00:36:14.599" style="s2">know that they experienced it as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.740" end="00:36:16.280" style="s2">passive reception of they either saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.599" end="00:36:18.109" style="s2">this or they saw that whereas I could</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.280" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">decide in real-time what I was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.109" end="00:36:22.040" style="s2">and I started to run some experiments</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.060" end="00:36:24.319" style="s2">that showed that there were definite</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.040" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">time scales at which this did happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.319" end="00:36:28.190" style="s2">over and therefore it also didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.650" style="s2">over and they were different than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.190" end="00:36:32.750" style="s2">time scales of the perception itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.650" end="00:36:35.780" style="s2">sort of just to say it quickly if the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.750" end="00:36:37.160" style="s2">motion patterns were too fast you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.780" end="00:36:38.510" style="s2">still perceive the motion but you could</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.160" end="00:36:40.579" style="s2">no longer control it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.510" end="00:36:42.170" style="s2">whereas if that you slow them down to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.579" end="00:36:44.450" style="s2">certain critical speed you could start</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.170" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">to actually control which pattern you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.450" end="00:36:48.050" style="s2">were perceiving and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">has some there&#39;s some deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.050" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">between these two as well and with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.410" style="s2">question of perceptual learning and how</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:55.910" style="s2">we discover affordances over time I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.410" end="00:36:58.220" style="s2">give you a great perceptual learning</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.910" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">example and once it happened to me about</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.220" end="00:37:02.450" style="s2">seven years ago I&#39;ve been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:05.420" style="s2">interested in perceptual learning you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.450" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">know as a farmer myself every spring I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.420" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">spend about seven to ten days</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.390" end="00:37:11.660" style="s2">eradicating invasive weeds that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.940" style="s2">trying to attack my field spring</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:17.480" style="s2">specific invasives right and they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.940" end="00:37:20.089" style="s2">coral berry Barbary and autumn olive</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.480" end="00:37:21.740" style="s2">right and after seven to ten days of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.089" end="00:37:23.990" style="s2">riding around four or five hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.740" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">in making a real-time decision on which</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.990" end="00:37:28.190" style="s2">is one of those three species before he</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.990" style="s2">has a pit when I was near done with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.190" end="00:37:32.660" style="s2">as I dried up the roads in a nearby town</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:34.369" style="s2">any invasive species in people&#39;s field</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.660" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just like blinked at me it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.369" end="00:37:38.089" style="s2">amazing all right they just popped it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.550" style="s2">was an astounding you know just really</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.089" end="00:37:41.990" style="s2">strong example of perceptual learning</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.550" end="00:37:43.819" style="s2">and since then I&#39;ve taken the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.990" end="00:37:46.190" style="s2">learning literature much more seriously</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.819" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">than I ever did before that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.190" end="00:37:51.069" style="s2">once again just to draw on my recent</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:53.499" style="s2">experiences of beginning the homestead</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.069" end="00:37:54.999" style="s2">lifestyle is just that when I first got</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.499" end="00:37:56.619" style="s2">here Jim I didn&#39;t even want to like clip</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.999" end="00:37:58.900" style="s2">a branch I was like what am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.619" end="00:38:00.579" style="s2">screw up if I clip this branch and over</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.900" end="00:38:02.859" style="s2">time I&#39;m developing the perception of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.579" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">sort of seeing out in time a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.859" end="00:38:07.449" style="s2">further where I can see you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:10.059" style="s2">let this thing go where will it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.449" end="00:38:12.369" style="s2">tend to go if I clip it now what will</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.059" end="00:38:14.410" style="s2">tend to happen say around it&#39;s gonna let</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.369" end="00:38:16.239" style="s2">more light in and things like that so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.410" end="00:38:18.519" style="s2">think that perceptual learning is really</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.239" end="00:38:21.069" style="s2">essential and it&#39;s fascinating the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.519" end="00:38:23.079" style="s2">we kind of have to step into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.069" end="00:38:24.729" style="s2">because you can&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.079" end="00:38:26.109" style="s2">perceive something you haven&#39;t perceived</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.729" end="00:38:28.089" style="s2">yet so you have to continue to put</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.109" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">yourself into the situation over and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.089" end="00:38:32.920" style="s2">over where these kind of serendipitous</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:35.079" style="s2">moments can happen where something</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.920" end="00:38:36.519" style="s2">clicks inside of you is it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.079" end="00:38:38.709" style="s2">some kind of a self organizational</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.519" end="00:38:40.690" style="s2">process can&#39;t be top-down directed but</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.709" end="00:38:42.219" style="s2">something snaps and all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.690" end="00:38:42.609" style="s2">can see something you couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.219" end="00:38:44.589" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.609" end="00:38:47.109" style="s2">you&#39;d have a tool that the higher-level</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.589" end="00:38:48.219" style="s2">systems can use also which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.109" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">what&#39;s that perceptual learning is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.219" end="00:38:51.910" style="s2">clicked in you can operate much more</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:54.459" style="s2">rapidly and targeting your invasives</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.910" end="00:38:56.349" style="s2">anyway let&#39;s flip back now to talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.459" end="00:38:58.209" style="s2">about complex systems and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.349" end="00:38:59.469" style="s2">things that you know it did trigger some</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.209" end="00:39:01.630" style="s2">thoughts in my head as I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.469" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">your dissertation is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.630" end="00:39:06.729" style="s2">between complex systems science and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:08.650" style="s2">modeling and simulations you know some</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.729" end="00:39:11.499" style="s2">people say hey you really can&#39;t do these</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.650" end="00:39:12.969" style="s2">probes on complex systems and at some</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.499" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">level they&#39;re correct but at other</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.969" end="00:39:17.140" style="s2">levels they&#39;re not I mean we hit we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.890" end="00:39:18.789" style="s2">do probes on complex systems with both</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.140" end="00:39:20.890" style="s2">models and thinking through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.789" end="00:39:22.989" style="s2">implications of models and sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.890" end="00:39:24.940" style="s2">quick and dirty with simulations have</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.989" end="00:39:27.009" style="s2">you given any thought to where model</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.940" end="00:39:29.529" style="s2">building and simulations fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.009" end="00:39:31.239" style="s2">explorations of complexity science yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.529" end="00:39:33.549" style="s2">absolutely and so from an applied</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.239" end="00:39:35.559" style="s2">perspective we&#39;re really trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.549" end="00:39:36.940" style="s2">a problem understand a system that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.559" end="00:39:38.680" style="s2">need to interact with better that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.940" end="00:39:41.410" style="s2">trying to get something from I think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.680" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">number one utility to modeling is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:46.029" style="s2">make assumptions very explicit so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:48.069" style="s2">have to if we want a computer simulation</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.029" end="00:39:49.989" style="s2">to run we have to write down what are</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.069" end="00:39:51.759" style="s2">the assumptions that are being made so</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.989" end="00:39:53.829" style="s2">that it can unfold its behavior at time</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.759" end="00:39:55.509" style="s2">making those assumptions very explicit</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.829" end="00:39:57.249" style="s2">and then when we go back to the system</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.509" end="00:39:58.430" style="s2">to observe the real natural system</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.249" end="00:40:00.200" style="s2">determining</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.430" end="00:40:02.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve made those the right assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.200" end="00:40:04.670" style="s2">so you know modeling and simulation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.599" end="00:40:07.130" style="s2">often considered in the paradigm of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.670" end="00:40:08.510" style="s2">prediction sort of build the model run</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.130" end="00:40:09.859" style="s2">it forward a time and predict what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.510" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">going to happen there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.859" end="00:40:12.920" style="s2">problems with that it can work under</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:16.250" style="s2">certain conditions but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.920" end="00:40:18.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a secondary kind of a utility of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.250" end="00:40:19.910" style="s2">modeling and really this primary utility</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.260" end="00:40:21.530" style="s2">is to didn&#39;t we get the assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:23.780" style="s2">right you know agent-based modeling I</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.530" end="00:40:26.300" style="s2">think one of the really powerful aspects</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.780" end="00:40:29.660" style="s2">of it is that because we&#39;re able to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.300" end="00:40:32.599" style="s2">a large set of micro assumptions we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.660" end="00:40:35.089" style="s2">actually see the difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.599" end="00:40:37.609" style="s2">aggregate behavior between what unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.089" end="00:40:39.290" style="s2">from that agent-based model and what</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.609" end="00:40:41.900" style="s2">maybe we would have thought would unfold</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.290" end="00:40:44.150" style="s2">if we did some more macro level formal</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.900" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">modeling say for example say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.150" end="00:40:48.619" style="s2">modeling a hospital and looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.790" style="s2">infections might propagate through a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.619" end="00:40:51.589" style="s2">hospital you know there&#39;s there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.790" end="00:40:52.550" style="s2">issue where you go to the hospital and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.589" end="00:40:53.690" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get better but you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.550" end="00:40:54.619" style="s2">might pick up an infection while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.690" end="00:40:56.930" style="s2">there because there&#39;s a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.619" end="00:40:58.339" style="s2">sick people around and whatnot so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.930" end="00:41:00.740" style="s2">say we&#39;re modeling that and if we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.339" end="00:41:02.750" style="s2">even AG based model we could say okay we</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.740" end="00:41:04.579" style="s2">can model a surface we can make some</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.750" end="00:41:06.530" style="s2">assumptions about if someone touches the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.579" end="00:41:08.119" style="s2">surface and they have say this bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.530" end="00:41:10.010" style="s2">on their hand maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.119" end="00:41:11.480" style="s2">probability that it transfers to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.010" end="00:41:13.160" style="s2">surface now someone else comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.480" end="00:41:14.930" style="s2">service so we can model really at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.160" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">very micro level where our assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.930" end="00:41:18.500" style="s2">are actually probably pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:20.180" style="s2">relative to our macro assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.500" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">whereas if we wanted to do some</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.180" end="00:41:24.230" style="s2">high-level mathematical modeling of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:25.970" style="s2">system we might assume something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.230" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">for instance that some set of events are</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.970" end="00:41:30.140" style="s2">independent like my touching a surface</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:31.460" style="s2">and you&#39;re touching a surface are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.140" end="00:41:33.290" style="s2">kind of independent events where they</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.460" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">might actually have interdependencies</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.290" end="00:41:38.450" style="s2">and therefore follow different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:40.549" style="s2">distributions and so that&#39;s just to give</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.450" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">a little bit of crystallization to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.549" end="00:41:46.069" style="s2">general idea that really we are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:48.410" style="s2">worst at understanding our own</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.069" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">assumptions and identifying where</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:52.040" style="s2">they&#39;re faulty and modeling and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.230" style="s2">simulation can allow us to draw them out</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.040" end="00:41:56.299" style="s2">force them to become explicit and give</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.230" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">us an opportunity to adjust them as we</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.299" end="00:42:00.440" style="s2">observe the real system the natural</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.630" style="s2">system I like that way of thinking I may</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.440" end="00:42:04.819" style="s2">add one additional thing which I often</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.630" end="00:42:06.440" style="s2">do when people are talking about models</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.819" end="00:42:07.970" style="s2">agent based models or physical</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.440" end="00:42:10.430" style="s2">simulations which is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.970" end="00:42:12.410" style="s2">one side it helps you clarify your</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.430" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">assumptions and on the second as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.410" end="00:42:17.000" style="s2">pointed out one should not believe any</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:19.940" style="s2">given subject area right however I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.000" end="00:42:21.800" style="s2">believe that once a model has been well</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.940" end="00:42:23.330" style="s2">developed and the assumptions vetted by</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.800" end="00:42:25.430" style="s2">experts and by the best available</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.330" end="00:42:27.260" style="s2">evidence one can often learn some</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.430" end="00:42:29.960" style="s2">interesting things from ensemble</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.260" end="00:42:32.150" style="s2">statistics of large numbers of runs</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.960" end="00:42:34.910" style="s2">right for instance we can find out if</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.150" end="00:42:37.940" style="s2">we&#39;re in mediocrity and/or extremists</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.910" end="00:42:39.980" style="s2">and in the NNT type language right we</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.940" end="00:42:41.990" style="s2">can see how much variance is there</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.980" end="00:42:43.609" style="s2">between the runs because the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.990" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">agent based models if they&#39;re not too</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.609" end="00:42:46.970" style="s2">big you can run them a million times</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.670" style="s2">right you can really get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.970" end="00:42:51.349" style="s2">statistical distribution of outcomes are</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.670" end="00:42:53.180" style="s2">we likely to see with this set of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.349" end="00:42:54.770" style="s2">assumptions I add that it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.180" end="00:42:57.770" style="s2">that people often miss when they think</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.770" end="00:43:00.050" style="s2">about what can you do with simulations</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.770" end="00:43:02.300" style="s2">or models that&#39;s right and I would never</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.050" end="00:43:04.820" style="s2">take a model too too seriously that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.300" end="00:43:06.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t have some stochastic City</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.820" end="00:43:08.300" style="s2">involved so that you run it you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.500" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">many times over and look at the in Samba</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.300" end="00:43:13.369" style="s2">that said there is always the danger</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:15.109" style="s2">that even across those who say build</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.369" end="00:43:18.170" style="s2">models in principle it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.109" end="00:43:20.510" style="s2">independently there are subtle ways for</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.170" end="00:43:21.859" style="s2">non independence of assumptions to arise</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.510" end="00:43:23.869" style="s2">you might think of something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.859" end="00:43:25.369" style="s2">climate science where you have many</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.869" end="00:43:27.410" style="s2">different teams many different</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.369" end="00:43:29.000" style="s2">individuals building models and some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.410" end="00:43:30.440" style="s2">the way they&#39;re structured some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.000" end="00:43:32.150" style="s2">factors they incorporate are different</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.440" end="00:43:33.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s some independence among how</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.150" end="00:43:36.470" style="s2">they&#39;re instantiated nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.560" end="00:43:37.849" style="s2">there&#39;s a cultural I almost a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.470" end="00:43:41.660" style="s2">climate maybe that&#39;s a little confusing</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.849" end="00:43:44.780" style="s2">oh well that can inject more subtle non</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.660" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">independence into the Assumption set and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.780" end="00:43:48.890" style="s2">so even when we do have a nice model</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:51.430" style="s2">even if it&#39;s very robust I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.890" end="00:43:54.500" style="s2">always always hyper cautious of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.430" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">committing too much to any action that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.500" end="00:43:59.060" style="s2">solely coming out of a modeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">prediction even on an ensemble but I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.060" end="00:44:03.170" style="s2">agree with your main point that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:04.970" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about you know run</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.170" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">them the deterministic model for it in</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.970" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">time and think that&#39;s how the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:10.430" style="s2">goes no the real world is always messier</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:12.290" style="s2">than that and ensembles are the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.430" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">way to think and even interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.290" end="00:44:17.660" style="s2">which you know you mentioned NNT the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">same we often think of running ensembles</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.660" end="00:44:22.040" style="s2">so that we can think of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:23.210" style="s2">of possibilities into the future but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.040" end="00:44:25.369" style="s2">actually have a lot of uncertainty about</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.210" end="00:44:27.140" style="s2">the past as well and thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.369" end="00:44:29.240" style="s2">past in terms of ensembles actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.140" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">makes a lot of sense - we only have one</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.240" end="00:44:34.369" style="s2">past we only have one but this is about</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">knowledge of the past and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.369" end="00:44:38.930" style="s2">very difficult to transmit you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:41.180" style="s2">perfect fidelity what actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.930" end="00:44:43.940" style="s2">in any given situation and in fact if</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.180" end="00:44:45.619" style="s2">you take seriously the idea of just just</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.940" end="00:44:48.980" style="s2">think of a simple fixed point attractor</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.619" end="00:44:50.420" style="s2">and if say more than one path you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.980" end="00:44:52.609" style="s2">converges any kind of many to one</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.420" end="00:44:54.950" style="s2">mapping then in principle we can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.609" end="00:44:56.510" style="s2">which paths led to it now we might have</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.950" end="00:44:59.210" style="s2">some nice evidence where we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.510" end="00:45:00.710" style="s2">reasonably say but as a general point</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:02.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a real problem with understanding</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.710" end="00:45:04.580" style="s2">kind of where we are where we come from</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.450" end="00:45:06.440" style="s2">interesting yeah you could run the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.580" end="00:45:07.910" style="s2">simulation backwards you know it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.440" end="00:45:09.710" style="s2">give you the answer but it will give you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.910" end="00:45:12.619" style="s2">a set of things some of which could be</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.710" end="00:45:15.230" style="s2">close to the answer right exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.619" end="00:45:16.820" style="s2">is actually pretty interesting what do</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.230" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">you think of climate science I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.820" end="00:45:20.089" style="s2">you&#39;ve written a little bit I saw your</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.089" end="00:45:24.140" style="s2">folks what are your thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.830" end="00:45:25.460" style="s2">climate science and how we should think</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.140" end="00:45:27.890" style="s2">about it and how we should think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.460" end="00:45:29.810" style="s2">as we know a fair amount of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.890" end="00:45:31.970" style="s2">is based on modeling where is your head</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.810" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">as a complexity applied the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.970" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">guy around climate science well you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.270" style="s2">the letter we wrote was really a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:40.280" style="s2">companion piece to our larger piece on</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.270" end="00:45:42.680" style="s2">we call non naive precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.280" end="00:45:44.150" style="s2">principle and with respect to climate</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.680" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of making a point that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.150" end="00:45:47.150" style="s2">think is essential for someone to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:49.490" style="s2">making and we have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.150" end="00:45:51.020" style="s2">polarized discussion where we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.490" end="00:45:53.300" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of the believers and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.020" end="00:45:54.710" style="s2">deniers and the believers say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.300" end="00:45:56.810" style="s2">what the models are saying here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.710" end="00:45:58.339" style="s2">scientific consensus they&#39;re saying so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.810" end="00:46:00.680" style="s2">here&#39;s why we should be worried about</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.339" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">climate and the deniers are saying you</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.680" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">know this is funded agenda or this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">the models are bunk and so we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">be worried about it but the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:12.500" style="s2">thing is we all can agree that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:13.859" style="s2">climate is important if it goes outside</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.500" end="00:46:15.630" style="s2">a range</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.859" end="00:46:18.089" style="s2">becomes too volatile and that&#39;s very bad</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.630" end="00:46:19.829" style="s2">for living systems including us and all</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.089" end="00:46:24.029" style="s2">of the life support systems we depend on</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.829" end="00:46:26.339" style="s2">so the implication of having poor models</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.029" end="00:46:28.259" style="s2">that do a bad job predicting is not at</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.339" end="00:46:30.029" style="s2">all well don&#39;t worry about it then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.259" end="00:46:32.279" style="s2">actually the opposite it says if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.029" end="00:46:34.589" style="s2">really have trouble predicting this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.279" end="00:46:37.109" style="s2">system and we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.589" end="00:46:39.479" style="s2">happen then we should probably exercise</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.109" end="00:46:41.880" style="s2">an abundance of precaution around this</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.479" end="00:46:44.759" style="s2">system and we should do what we can to</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.739" end="00:46:57.390" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to necessarily understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.109" end="00:46:59.640" style="s2">the exact trajectory of dynamics that</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.700" end="00:47:13.019" style="s2">once then you&#39;re easily contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.309" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">the destabilization of what is likely a</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.890" end="00:47:23.999" style="s2">we have around the models the more we</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.809" end="00:47:27.029" style="s2">need to move forward with an abundance</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.999" end="00:47:28.829" style="s2">of caution and not assume that oh well</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.029" end="00:47:30.599" style="s2">you know if the models aren&#39;t great at</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.599" end="00:47:34.469" style="s2">about it and I would also add this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.729" end="00:47:37.589" style="s2">Mary always look for is get away from</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.469" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">just data and look at causality there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.589" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">a base causality around climate which</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:44.239" style="s2">everybody needs to keep in mind which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:45.869" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolute easily provable</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.239" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">physical-chemical</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.869" end="00:47:53.130" style="s2">finding that if you build a system and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:56.489" style="s2">add greenhouse gases into it and radiate</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.130" end="00:47:59.459" style="s2">light into that system and have it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.489" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">reflect back as infrared more energy</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.459" end="00:48:02.109" style="s2">will be stored in the system that has</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:04.180" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.109" end="00:48:06.700" style="s2">greenhouse gases so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.180" end="00:48:08.710" style="s2">important base fact which some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.700" end="00:48:11.230" style="s2">deniers don&#39;t even seem to know right</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.710" end="00:48:13.749" style="s2">that is true and the question then</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.230" end="00:48:16.059" style="s2">becomes from my perspective what are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.749" end="00:48:19.329" style="s2">other agents in the system that might</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.059" end="00:48:21.339" style="s2">then start feeding back and alter that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.329" end="00:48:23.230" style="s2">particular trajectory so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.339" end="00:48:25.749" style="s2">like Freeman Dyson that has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.230" end="00:48:27.309" style="s2">well the earth is greening and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.749" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">you have all the co2 the atmosphere that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.309" end="00:48:30.579" style="s2">means that plants grow more easily so</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:32.680" style="s2">the earth is greening so you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.579" end="00:48:34.869" style="s2">some kind of feedback effects now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.680" end="00:48:36.339" style="s2">really arguing that once again oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.869" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">no problem it will kind of stabilize out</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.339" end="00:48:41.499" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:43.150" style="s2">priori but certainly yes you you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.499" end="00:48:46.539" style="s2">some pretty sound science there that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.150" end="00:48:48.130" style="s2">says given these assumptions yes you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.539" end="00:48:50.289" style="s2">will have more energy in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.130" end="00:48:51.549" style="s2">that means that you expect to enter a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.289" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">different regime than you&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.549" end="00:48:56.499" style="s2">in which for us is probably not a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:59.529" style="s2">thing not now to your point there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.499" end="00:49:02.140" style="s2">many many side loops for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.529" end="00:49:05.140" style="s2">climate models probably the least bound</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.140" end="00:49:07.480" style="s2">element in the simulations around cloud</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.140" end="00:49:09.849" style="s2">formation with increased water vapor in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.480" end="00:49:11.559" style="s2">the atmosphere right and say well why is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.849" end="00:49:14.170" style="s2">that important because clouds are far</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.559" end="00:49:16.900" style="s2">more reflective of light then the earth</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.170" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">or the water is so you know if cloud</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.900" end="00:49:21.190" style="s2">formation as water vapour cycles operate</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:22.809" style="s2">faster and faster in the atmosphere as</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.190" end="00:49:25.930" style="s2">temperature starts to rise a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.809" end="00:49:28.420" style="s2">it is possible the cloud formation could</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.930" end="00:49:30.670" style="s2">be the adapter that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.420" end="00:49:32.710" style="s2">constrains the system but the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.670" end="00:49:34.539" style="s2">models we have show that while it makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.710" end="00:49:37.150" style="s2">a significant difference in the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.539" end="00:49:38.769" style="s2">run-up it is nowhere near enough to stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.150" end="00:49:40.390" style="s2">the run-up at least that&#39;s the models</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.769" end="00:49:42.999" style="s2">I&#39;m familiar with the other second</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.390" end="00:49:44.950" style="s2">biggest one is the absorption of co2</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.999" end="00:49:47.170" style="s2">into the oceans now that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.950" end="00:49:49.180" style="s2">short-term fix because the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.170" end="00:49:51.009" style="s2">problem is let&#39;s assume somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.180" end="00:49:53.559" style="s2">magically which does not appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.009" end="00:49:55.900" style="s2">correct from the physical chemistry that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.559" end="00:49:58.480" style="s2">all the co2 excess co2 is absorbed the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.900" end="00:50:01.059" style="s2">ocean the end result is an acidic ocean</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.480" end="00:50:02.380" style="s2">with all kinds of dire effects right you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.059" end="00:50:03.670" style="s2">know I think that&#39;s for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.380" end="00:50:05.289" style="s2">that&#39;s been one of the more downplayed</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.670" end="00:50:06.849" style="s2">aspects of the danger is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.289" end="00:50:09.700" style="s2">acidification of oceans and what that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.849" end="00:50:12.099" style="s2">means for coal earth ecosystems and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.700" end="00:50:12.760" style="s2">of course in this particular case we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.099" end="00:50:14.320" style="s2">talk about the</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.320" end="00:50:18.460" style="s2">but in the area of climate there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.540" end="00:50:19.990" style="s2">side loops and we can see in the</p>

<p begin="00:50:19.990" end="00:50:25.210" style="s2">where we could move from you know</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:01.570" style="s2">could cause a very rapid run eopns and</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.030" end="00:51:11.140" style="s2">fully mapped you could get a positive</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.670" end="00:51:16.870" style="s2">causes more methane ices to evaporate</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.870" end="00:51:22.510" style="s2">air and we could rapidly spin up to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.730" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">something like a 15 degree C 25 26</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:29.860" style="s2">truly disastrous and so the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:31.480" style="s2">our system with the side loops that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.860" end="00:51:33.460" style="s2">could drive positive feedback as a</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.320" end="00:51:39.910" style="s2">and obviously there are potential as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.110" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">put them side loops that have negative</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.910" end="00:51:43.840" style="s2">feedback but really that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">not sure about you&#39;ve mentioned this one</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.840" end="00:51:47.500" style="s2">particular one how many have we not</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.500" end="00:51:51.100" style="s2">of positive feedback loops points of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.000" end="00:51:52.990" style="s2">instability are there lurking that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.100" end="00:51:54.850" style="s2">know nothing about right now and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.990" end="00:51:56.470" style="s2">don&#39;t want to find out the hard way we</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.850" end="00:51:58.780" style="s2">do know from the geological record that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.470" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">it has happened from the Greenland ice</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:03.310" style="s2">cores we have found periods where</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:05.700" style="s2">temperatures have jumped 15 C in 50</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.310" end="00:52:07.690" style="s2">years that would be catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.700" end="00:52:10.540" style="s2">interesting well let&#39;s talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.690" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">precautionary principle I read carefully</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.540" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">your paper on GMOs mm-hmm I will say</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:20.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a paper on precautionary principle</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">and we we use the application as GMOs as</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.470" end="00:52:24.260" style="s2">an example case yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">killer powers a counterexample case and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.260" end="00:52:28.369" style="s2">i will say i walked into it with a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:30.230" style="s2">farmer&#39;s bias that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.369" end="00:52:32.270" style="s2">right but on the other hand by time I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.230" end="00:52:35.119" style="s2">was finished reading and I said mmm</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.270" end="00:52:37.819" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re right but I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:39.380" style="s2">probe into that one a little bit and see</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.819" end="00:52:42.260" style="s2">if we can clarify my thinking and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.380" end="00:52:44.119" style="s2">yours why don&#39;t you tell the story and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.260" end="00:52:45.109" style="s2">use it from the GMO perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.119" end="00:52:47.660" style="s2">maybe if you want to compare and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.109" end="00:52:49.640" style="s2">contrast with nuclear on the story were</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.660" end="00:52:51.619" style="s2">telling of that paper we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.640" end="00:52:52.789" style="s2">for a long time frankly a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.619" end="00:52:54.890" style="s2">talking point is sort of we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.789" end="00:52:56.329" style="s2">modifying organisms forever which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.890" end="00:52:58.700" style="s2">true we&#39;ve been doing it from an</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.329" end="00:53:00.770" style="s2">artificial selection standpoint now what</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.700" end="00:53:03.530" style="s2">is happening with GMO is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.770" end="00:53:05.510" style="s2">top-down design thinking where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.530" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">saying okay we have this ability to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.510" end="00:53:10.670" style="s2">insert trans genes into organisms and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:13.309" style="s2">elicit desirable properties and then use</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.670" end="00:53:14.780" style="s2">those as cultivars in agriculture so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.309" end="00:53:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s actually quite a few problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.780" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">here but one of the fundamental issues</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.210" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">is that these designs that these folks</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">are imagining these sort of whole system</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:27.829" style="s2">design of kind of reimagining every</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:30.529" style="s2">facet of Agriculture are making a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.829" end="00:53:32.420" style="s2">simplifying assumptions around what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.529" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">complexities of Agriculture actually are</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.420" end="00:53:37.549" style="s2">and the way complex systems work and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:39.950" style="s2">they push back on things so just as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.549" end="00:53:42.740" style="s2">very sort of well-known example</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.950" end="00:53:45.349" style="s2">herbicidal resistance is often</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.740" end="00:53:48.470" style="s2">engineered into these organisms well lo</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.349" end="00:53:50.809" style="s2">and behold the herbicide is used a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.470" end="00:53:53.420" style="s2">on these crops so that the crops live</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.809" end="00:53:55.099" style="s2">and the weeds die well the weeds evolve</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.420" end="00:53:56.869" style="s2">herbicide resistance right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.099" end="00:53:58.250" style="s2">these assumptions that aren&#39;t built into</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.869" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">their top-down design that they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.250" end="00:54:02.420" style="s2">reacting to but are not something they</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:05.059" style="s2">imagined happening there&#39;s other issues</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.420" end="00:54:06.980" style="s2">specific issues like the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.059" end="00:54:08.779" style="s2">know they claim the pesticide usage</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.980" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">levels are way down but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.779" end="00:54:12.950" style="s2">accounting for the fact that all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">these organisms are generating producing</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.950" end="00:54:17.270" style="s2">bt pesticides inside of them inside of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:19.400" style="s2">each cell endogenously producing these</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.270" end="00:54:20.990" style="s2">proteins so the idea that the count of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.400" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">application is down doesn&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.990" end="00:54:24.109" style="s2">what&#39;s actually in there and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:26.089" style="s2">specifically has the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.109" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">of what you can&#39;t wash that off and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.089" end="00:54:28.759" style="s2">other problems as well as you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:30.529" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to the pollinator</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.759" end="00:54:33.319" style="s2">populations these are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.529" end="00:54:34.789" style="s2">service insecticides for these crops so</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.319" end="00:54:38.029" style="s2">those are some specific issues the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.789" end="00:54:40.190" style="s2">general issue is we are tinkering with</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.029" end="00:54:43.369" style="s2">we are playing with you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:54:43.369" end="00:54:48.680" style="s2">runaway cascade effects can happen in</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.769" end="00:55:05.809" style="s2">the paper the idea isn&#39;t that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.430" end="00:55:08.809" style="s2">activity of modifying the organism is in</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.809" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">and of itself dangerous or risky the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.809" end="00:55:14.900" style="s2">issue is we are without any sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:16.519" style="s2">potential cascade effects we are</p>

<p begin="00:55:37.789" end="00:55:44.420" style="s2">effect on crops there&#39;s no clear upper</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.180" end="00:55:47.329" style="s2">bound at which if we move into a space</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.809" end="00:56:20.619" style="s2">the idea isn&#39;t to predict one or other</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.240" end="00:57:02.770" style="s2">replacing other more time-tested systems</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.670" end="00:57:06.460" style="s2">with these kinds of systems as another</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.770" end="00:57:08.170" style="s2">kind of bonus risk and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.460" end="00:57:10.270" style="s2">okay we&#39;re definitely in a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.170" end="00:57:12.760" style="s2">regime where fat tails exist we</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.270" end="00:57:14.680" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t have the analytic nor</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.760" end="00:57:17.170" style="s2">modeling and simulation tools to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.680" end="00:57:19.390" style="s2">exhaustively look at the possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.170" end="00:57:21.579" style="s2">trajectories of this we&#39;re not treating</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.390" end="00:57:23.800" style="s2">this as a risk to environmental exposure</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.579" end="00:57:26.140" style="s2">but we are exposing the environment to</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.800" end="00:57:28.300" style="s2">it in a massive way and so you start to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.140" end="00:57:31.260" style="s2">stack up these different features and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.300" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">you see that this is a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.260" end="00:57:35.800" style="s2">we&#39;re imagining these benefits you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:36.520" style="s2">I hate the corporate talking points</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.800" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re frankly</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.520" end="00:57:40.030" style="s2">unethical but you know oh don&#39;t you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.130" style="s2">to feed the world is this can feed the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.030" end="00:57:43.420" style="s2">world and your way won&#39;t for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.130" end="00:57:44.680" style="s2">reason even though that&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.420" end="00:57:46.420" style="s2">straw man there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.680" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">approaches that don&#39;t pose the same risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.420" end="00:57:50.170" style="s2">that could indeed feed the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:51.910" style="s2">so you&#39;re stacking all of these risks up</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.170" end="00:57:54.579" style="s2">and you&#39;re pointed to these benefits and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.910" end="00:57:56.920" style="s2">the fact of the matter is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.579" end="00:57:59.470" style="s2">have these potential downsides</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.920" end="00:58:01.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no finite amount of benefits you</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.470" end="00:58:04.030" style="s2">can kind of articulate and tack on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.750" end="00:58:05.799" style="s2">justify taking the risk of collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.030" end="00:58:07.869" style="s2">ecosystems which we all depend on which</p>

<p begin="00:58:12.490" end="00:58:18.190" style="s2">back a little bit right we quickly were</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.109" end="00:58:31.990" style="s2">ameliorate it when we think about GMOs I</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.109" end="00:58:36.670" style="s2">have yet to see a compelling causal</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.990" end="00:58:40.119" style="s2">story on how a GMO plant could cause</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.670" end="00:58:42.250" style="s2">widespread devastation in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.119" end="00:58:44.470" style="s2">let&#39;s think you know one example ok I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.250" end="00:58:44.950" style="s2">take the example let&#39;s use cotton it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:58:44.950" end="00:58:50.170" style="s2">number one GMO planet if you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:51.820" style="s2">another one we can use corn cotton soy</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.170" end="00:58:53.980" style="s2">these are the ones that are at mostly</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.820" end="00:58:56.589" style="s2">mono crop so obviously you have at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.980" end="00:58:58.900" style="s2">level of human nourishment the ability</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.589" end="00:59:01.060" style="s2">to eat you have the risks of massive</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.900" end="00:59:02.890" style="s2">amounts of monoculture coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.060" end="00:59:05.560" style="s2">this sort of unprecedented levels of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.890" end="00:59:07.540" style="s2">monoculture now monoculture is a risk</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.560" end="00:59:09.490" style="s2">regardless of GMO but GM overly</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.540" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">exacerbates the degree of monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.490" end="00:59:12.730" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:15.670" style="s2">talking globally so if you did have some</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.730" end="00:59:18.460" style="s2">kind of a viral event or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.670" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">pathogen event this can spread now</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.460" end="00:59:23.560" style="s2">worldwide and the effect on our food</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:26.560" style="s2">system our food supply could be massive</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.560" end="00:59:28.930" style="s2">and imagine all the other interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.560" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">interdependent human systems once the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.930" end="00:59:33.369" style="s2">food system starts to be stressed that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:35.619" style="s2">hard okay so so there&#39;s one let&#39;s stop</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.369" end="00:59:38.260" style="s2">there because what you just described is</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.619" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">the danger of monoculture not the danger</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.260" end="00:59:44.470" style="s2">of GMO and we had horrendous monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:47.470" style="s2">long far back as we probably know like</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.470" end="00:59:50.170" style="s2">95% of our bananas they&#39;re all clones of</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.470" end="00:59:52.119" style="s2">one banana it&#39;s astounding and apples</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.170" end="00:59:55.089" style="s2">were way more monoculture than they are</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.119" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">now I never blew mostly eaten apples nor</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.089" end="00:59:59.589" style="s2">mostly in bananas but more and more we</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:01.480" style="s2">are mostly eating corn mostly eating soy</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.589" end="01:00:05.500" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about these crops and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.480" end="01:00:07.329" style="s2">the GMO in this case is a enabler of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.500" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">degree of monoculture that didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.329" end="01:00:12.280" style="s2">before at least early before you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:14.470" style="s2">the patents expire etc it may actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.280" end="01:00:16.690" style="s2">drive diversity if people take different</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.470" end="01:00:18.520" style="s2">GMO approaches so I would say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.690" end="01:00:19.810" style="s2">arguing against the monoculture which I</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.520" end="01:00:22.060" style="s2">strongly agree with we can have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.810" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">wonderful conversation about that it may</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.060" end="01:00:27.220" style="s2">be that GMO is an accelerant but it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:31.000" style="s2">not I would say in the in this leaf</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.220" end="01:00:32.740" style="s2">first argument not the fundamental well</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.000" end="01:00:34.750" style="s2">you say it could be an accelerant but</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.740" end="01:00:37.210" style="s2">but as we know well from complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.750" end="01:00:39.099" style="s2">science more is different so when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.210" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">when you speed something up that quickly</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.099" end="01:00:42.670" style="s2">you can quickly end up in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.589" style="s2">qualitatively different regime and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.670" end="01:00:46.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re positing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.589" end="01:00:46.830" style="s2">experiencing with this so yes you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.510" end="01:00:49.110" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.830" end="01:00:51.810" style="s2">there other ways but getting there</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.110" end="01:00:53.190" style="s2">faster implies much more risk the one</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.810" end="01:00:55.350" style="s2">could throw out a counter way to</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.190" end="01:00:58.170" style="s2">regulate right rather than to be in</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.350" end="01:00:59.940" style="s2">Europe and banning GMOs let&#39;s say we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.170" end="01:01:03.780" style="s2">have an anti Monaco to rule we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.940" end="01:01:08.490" style="s2">require that no more than 20% of any</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.780" end="01:01:11.400" style="s2">grain crop can be within X DN a has a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.490" end="01:01:14.490" style="s2">Hamming distance of the rest of the crop</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.400" end="01:01:17.490" style="s2">and so force diversity rather than ban</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.490" end="01:01:19.590" style="s2">the technology you could what you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.490" end="01:01:20.790" style="s2">find I mean in a realistic application</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.590" end="01:01:23.310" style="s2">that so let&#39;s say we wanted that as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.790" end="01:01:26.370" style="s2">policy what what would happen well the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.310" end="01:01:28.620" style="s2">value proposition to global corporations</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.370" end="01:01:30.510" style="s2">would drop rapidly because their whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.620" end="01:01:32.280" style="s2">value prop is really about this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.510" end="01:01:34.530" style="s2">actually hard to develop a GMO line so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.280" end="01:01:36.180" style="s2">they kind of every once in a while</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.530" end="01:01:38.820" style="s2">something that makes sense for their</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.180" end="01:01:40.440" style="s2">profit model and they deploy it in sync</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.820" end="01:01:42.450" style="s2">so you would experience a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.440" end="01:01:45.330" style="s2">pushback on that policy via regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.450" end="01:01:46.560" style="s2">capture from these large corporations so</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.330" end="01:01:48.750" style="s2">just in terms of real-world</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.560" end="01:01:50.070" style="s2">implementation of a policy like that so</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.750" end="01:01:51.090" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine that somehow we could get</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.070" end="01:01:52.770" style="s2">such a policy implemented</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.090" end="01:01:55.410" style="s2">I agree that&#39;d be a great mitigant would</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.770" end="01:01:56.190" style="s2">that mitigate all of the risks of GMO no</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.410" end="01:01:58.890" style="s2">not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.190" end="01:02:01.320" style="s2">we have other issues like crossbreeding</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.890" end="01:02:04.620" style="s2">things are promiscuous in nature you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.320" end="01:02:07.260" style="s2">know from bacteria to plants and there</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.620" end="01:02:10.680" style="s2">is very good evidence of these traits</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.260" end="01:02:12.150" style="s2">not staying confined into the the crops</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.680" end="01:02:14.250" style="s2">themselves but actually crossbreeding</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.150" end="01:02:15.750" style="s2">into wild grasses and things for</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.250" end="01:02:19.080" style="s2">instance is a very interesting study in</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.750" end="01:02:21.990" style="s2">Switzerland that has had from you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.080" end="01:02:25.080" style="s2">day 0 a total ban on the cultivation or</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.990" end="01:02:27.090" style="s2">import of GMO and what you find are</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.080" end="01:02:28.770" style="s2">grasses that have cross bred and have</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.090" end="01:02:30.870" style="s2">these traits along the train tracks</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.770" end="01:02:33.240" style="s2">while Y along the train tracks because</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.870" end="01:02:35.730" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of a pollination event</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.240" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s happening the trains travel</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.730" end="01:02:38.850" style="s2">themselves so there&#39;s all these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:41.250" style="s2">dynamics that we&#39;re not factoring in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.850" end="01:02:42.870" style="s2">about how things spread and when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.250" end="01:02:44.850" style="s2">talking about spreading these traits</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.870" end="01:02:47.550" style="s2">well what traits well there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.850" end="01:02:50.070" style="s2">frankly propaganda around oh they could</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.550" end="01:02:51.810" style="s2">be traits that are for drought tolerance</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.070" end="01:02:51.970" style="s2">and they could be traits for you know if</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.810" end="01:02:54.040" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.970" end="01:02:56.560" style="s2">so that people don&#39;t go blind and things</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.040" end="01:02:59.470" style="s2">but in reality the only traits that have</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.560" end="01:03:01.510" style="s2">found any utility are herbicidal</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.470" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">resistance and insecticide production</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.510" end="01:03:06.490" style="s2">and so we could imagine a different</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.000" end="01:03:08.109" style="s2">universe in which some other trait is</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.490" end="01:03:10.150" style="s2">discovered now when we go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.109" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">this is a little different no free lunch</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.150" end="01:03:12.760" style="s2">than we were talking about before but</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:14.470" style="s2">there&#39;s no free lunch in terms of you</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.760" end="01:03:16.090" style="s2">know you&#39;re gonna engineer and drought</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.470" end="01:03:18.130" style="s2">tolerance well well something&#39;s gotta</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.090" end="01:03:20.349" style="s2">give so what does that mean a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.130" end="01:03:22.840" style="s2">stuff is more fantastical than practical</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.349" end="01:03:25.000" style="s2">but in essence we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.840" end="01:03:26.790" style="s2">systems that can do many things so mono</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.000" end="01:03:29.500" style="s2">crop is one of the features</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.790" end="01:03:31.300" style="s2">crossbreeding and spreading proteins and</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.500" end="01:03:33.040" style="s2">amplifying certain proteins that might</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.300" end="01:03:34.990" style="s2">say service and secta size throughout an</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.990" end="01:03:39.730" style="s2">systemic risk so we need pollinators I</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.630" end="01:03:41.080" style="s2">don&#39;t really buy the idea that we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.730" end="01:03:42.250" style="s2">replace all their pollinators with</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.080" end="01:03:42.849" style="s2">little robots and everything will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.250" end="01:03:45.340" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.849" end="01:03:47.530" style="s2">we need these ecosystems cyclers and</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.340" end="01:03:49.510" style="s2">connector nodes and pollinators are a</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.530" end="01:03:52.270" style="s2">huge one of those and we&#39;re also now</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.510" end="01:03:55.000" style="s2">we&#39;re having wild plants that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.270" end="01:03:56.320" style="s2">growing insecticide in ways that no</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.000" end="01:03:58.510" style="s2">other plant was growing them before and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.320" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">now plants in general do often have</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.510" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">insecticidal qualities but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:05.440" style="s2">presenting a very novel exposure in</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:06.700" style="s2">short order in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.440" end="01:04:08.710" style="s2">respect something we talked about before</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.700" end="01:04:09.580" style="s2">the co-evolutionary dynamics of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.710" end="01:04:11.470" style="s2">ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.580" end="01:04:13.510" style="s2">now ecosystems generally play nice</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.470" end="01:04:16.150" style="s2">precisely because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.510" end="01:04:18.700" style="s2">coevolution happening as an example of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.150" end="01:04:21.609" style="s2">non GMO issue that we all recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.700" end="01:04:23.140" style="s2">is related to this is invasive species</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.609" end="01:04:25.210" style="s2">why are invasive species invasive you</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.140" end="01:04:27.670" style="s2">were talking about those weeds well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.210" end="01:04:29.470" style="s2">because they&#39;re now in a new context</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.670" end="01:04:31.330" style="s2">that they weren&#39;t in before and so they</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.470" end="01:04:33.160" style="s2">lacked the co-evolutionary history of</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.330" end="01:04:35.109" style="s2">that ecosystem and so there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.160" end="01:04:36.640" style="s2">proper push and pull that develops over</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.109" end="01:04:38.530" style="s2">time so how does that proper push and</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.640" end="01:04:40.930" style="s2">pull develop it&#39;s the coevolution and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.530" end="01:04:43.480" style="s2">frankly small local extinction events</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.930" end="01:04:44.589" style="s2">when coevolution doesn&#39;t satisfy you</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.480" end="01:04:46.510" style="s2">know when it ends up in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.589" end="01:04:48.490" style="s2">Malthusian extinction and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.510" end="01:04:51.369" style="s2">somehow something undercuts its own</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.490" end="01:04:53.019" style="s2">resource or assumption set of survival</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.369" end="01:04:55.749" style="s2">and so without this</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.019" end="01:04:57.549" style="s2">illusionary process we&#39;re really playing</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.749" end="01:05:00.069" style="s2">with fire here and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.549" end="01:05:02.649" style="s2">monoculture it&#39;s systemic perturbation</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.069" end="01:05:04.390" style="s2">of ecosystem functioning that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.649" end="01:05:06.459" style="s2">but let&#39;s say there&#39;s a hop it to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.390" end="01:05:08.589" style="s2">specific grass in a specific region back</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.459" end="01:05:10.479" style="s2">to your paper wouldn&#39;t that fall into</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.589" end="01:05:12.369" style="s2">the limited category say it&#39;s a specific</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.479" end="01:05:15.339" style="s2">grass that lives at a certain elevation</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.369" end="01:05:17.589" style="s2">in the highlands of Central Europe in</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.339" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">Switzerland right if that is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.589" end="01:05:20.409" style="s2">happens yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:22.689" style="s2">but the issue is we can&#39;t exhaustively</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.409" end="01:05:25.359" style="s2">say all the ifs that might occur with</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.689" end="01:05:28.509" style="s2">this and we are certainly in a space</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.359" end="01:05:30.489" style="s2">where massive spread beyond such bounds</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.509" end="01:05:32.529" style="s2">are possible so there is every</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.489" end="01:05:34.239" style="s2">possibility in the world that yes some</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.529" end="01:05:36.130" style="s2">event could happen that would then be</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.239" end="01:05:38.439" style="s2">contained and bounded of course you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.130" end="01:05:41.259" style="s2">this is inherent in the idea of say a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.439" end="01:05:43.989" style="s2">power-law distribution there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.259" end="01:05:46.239" style="s2">many many many small events what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.989" end="01:05:49.539" style="s2">problem is is that every once in a while</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.239" end="01:05:50.890" style="s2">you have a very very big event and these</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.539" end="01:05:53.019" style="s2">are what we&#39;re worried about not the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.890" end="01:05:55.239" style="s2">many small events I did like that part</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.019" end="01:05:57.069" style="s2">of your argument and I will say it will</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.239" end="01:05:59.019" style="s2">cause me to think about this more but I</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.069" end="01:06:01.059" style="s2">would say I&#39;m not yet convinced because</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.019" end="01:06:03.130" style="s2">I will put the challenge back to you and</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.059" end="01:06:06.630" style="s2">the people you work with to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.130" end="01:06:09.369" style="s2">a causal mechanism by which plant based</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.630" end="01:06:12.069" style="s2">pasts could go out of control on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.369" end="01:06:14.709" style="s2">worldwide basis as opposed to perhaps do</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.069" end="01:06:17.109" style="s2">some damage to a local ecosystem where a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.709" end="01:06:19.449" style="s2">given species in which there was a Hopf</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.109" end="01:06:21.969" style="s2">occurred but we know no plant species</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.449" end="01:06:23.769" style="s2">are ubiquitous around the world well the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.969" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">thing that&#39;s changing that is our</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.769" end="01:06:28.329" style="s2">agriculture and our international</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:30.539" style="s2">transport so more and more we are</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.329" end="01:06:33.069" style="s2">getting species that are very widespread</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.539" end="01:06:35.589" style="s2">crops that are very widespread with very</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.069" end="01:06:37.089" style="s2">little genetic diversity so I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.589" end="01:06:38.769" style="s2">the pushback frankly I think it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.089" end="01:06:40.329" style="s2">good to kind of sharpen the sword and to</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.769" end="01:06:42.369" style="s2">question one&#39;s assumptions another</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.329" end="01:06:43.749" style="s2">relevant piece that comes to mind with</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.369" end="01:06:45.969" style="s2">respect to the precautionary principle</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.749" end="01:06:48.239" style="s2">and how we&#39;re presenting it is what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.969" end="01:06:50.859" style="s2">the supposed problem that this</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.239" end="01:06:53.199" style="s2">innovation is addressing or this</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.859" end="01:06:55.089" style="s2">intervention is addressing and are there</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.199" end="01:06:57.699" style="s2">other ways that present a lot less</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.089" end="01:07:01.809" style="s2">uncertainty to address this and in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.699" end="01:07:03.640" style="s2">case of agriculture there is all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.809" end="01:07:05.470" style="s2">promise in the world of other approaches</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.640" end="01:07:07.630" style="s2">not only don&#39;t present the risks that</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.470" end="01:07:09.340" style="s2">GMO presents but also have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.630" end="01:07:10.990" style="s2">other positive externalities that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.340" end="01:07:12.820" style="s2">mitigate a lot of other risks we face</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.990" end="01:07:14.770" style="s2">for instance around soil erosion and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.820" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">things of that nature and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.770" end="01:07:19.990" style="s2">feeds back into carbon sequestration and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:21.760" style="s2">all these other issues so it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.990" end="01:07:23.560" style="s2">that there&#39;s risks it&#39;s that we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.760" end="01:07:25.420" style="s2">alternatives that don&#39;t present the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.560" end="01:07:27.040" style="s2">risks yeah I would agree with that now</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.420" end="01:07:28.360" style="s2">would be a wonderful discussion and at</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.040" end="01:07:30.700" style="s2">some point in the future I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.360" end="01:07:32.800" style="s2">a whole month on forward-thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.700" end="01:07:35.220" style="s2">agriculture now maybe I&#39;ll have you back</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.800" end="01:07:38.170" style="s2">we can talk just about this topic</p>

<p begin="01:07:38.170" end="01:07:41.830" style="s2">has been a wonderful conversation and</p>
