<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">in choice making a lot of my work</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">centers around</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">ontological questions so questions about</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">what is what is a concept what are ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">how do you map them</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">how do you make them and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">this presentation comes in so i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">to share my screen</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">bear with me um super experimental</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">never done this before in person</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">tell me if you guys you guys see my</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">okay cool so concept unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">is the alchemical art of concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">creation while chemical</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to that but first the limits</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">of my language are the limits</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">of my world ludwig withgenstein said</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">this and i believe it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">um my question to you is can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">consciously expand</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">the limits of our language to midwife a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">more beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to lose my voice this early</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">into the presentation i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">um so concept unfolding is is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">systematic generation of new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">from incipient concepts so in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">session i want to familiarize you with</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">this psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">by demonstrating in action um initiating</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">breakout sessions so that you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">use it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">allow your creative juices to flow and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">hopefully help emerge a set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">completely new concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">so how does it work</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">building blocks are concepts which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">morphemes like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">horse which are the the the unit words</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">in compound words like horsemanship for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">uh so so a lot of the concepts that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">use democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">have dem have two words within</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">themselves or several morphemes within</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">demos kratos people power power of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">for example uh and along with concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">lenses or functions or morphisms so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">people familiar</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">with uh the mathematical uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">subdiscipline of category theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">will understand what a morphism is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">just like a mapping from one concept to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">another or a function</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see it&#39;s a lot simpler than</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">what it sounds like um</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">the process is choose a concept choose a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">lens</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">run the concept through the lens define</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">the resulting concept</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">and then assess its usefulness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what it looks like you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">got your original</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">pentagon you run it through a lens then</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">you get a diamond</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">right but to make this really juicy i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">stop sharing my screen and perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">guys can see this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">or i spent like part of the day doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">origami i&#39;m really bad at it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">so this is a swan in the swan</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">peter can you see this okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">so so the swan could unfold</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">in the in concept space right into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">pyramid just use your imagination here</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">or a dragon this drag it&#39;s so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">make dragons</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">um but i i did my best we want we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">we want swans to unfold into dragons or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">dragons into swans we don&#39;t want these</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">kind of like nothing concepts</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">and and i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna give you a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">disclaimer as to why</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">concept unfolding is a terrible psycho</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">technology before i proceed any further</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">and just like shoot myself in the foot</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">so back to sharing my screen</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">right so why is this a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">psychotec</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">a high degree of freedom so essentially</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">recombinable with concepts</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">you have um infinite combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">an infinite combinatorial system so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">and then we can recombine the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">that have been combined with other</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">concepts and so this system grows</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">infinitely and expands into itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">exponentially which means it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">what does that mean you can&#39;t complete</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t have time to completely</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">um and uh and so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">to navigate this exhaustively the space</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">term is non-ergodicity</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">you can&#39;t possibly exhaustively explore</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">um so so essentially our we can use our</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">our creativity to its maximum capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to be lost in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">expect exponentially large space</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">of course before the cart problem as</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">concepts are used to label experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">in conscious awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">um and so but right now what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">is creating concepts</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">absent the reference so absent the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">to which the concept</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">points to we&#39;re just engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">abstract creation of concepts</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">that&#39;s an exceptionally hard thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">um very disorienting no concept compass</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know which direction to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">in concept space that is maximally</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">relevant so if i take this</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">i can&#39;t see it again i have to un unsure</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a really clumsy presentation guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">so if i take this concept space</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">right here um it&#39;s not flat there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">peaks and valleys</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">right um peaks represent</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">local optima so places where concepts</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">are are pretty useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">and there may be global optima somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">we can un possibly unfold language</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">in a direction that is maximally optimal</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">it will contribute maximally to human</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">right because the limits of my language</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">are the limits of my world</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">but we don&#39;t know where that direction</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">i have some open questions that i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">share with you before i um</p>
