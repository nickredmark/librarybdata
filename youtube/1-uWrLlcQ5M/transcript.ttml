<p begin="00:00:19.670" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">thanks very much John it&#39;s nice to speak</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">to you having you know what&#39;s the little</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">we&#39;re doing from afar I particularly sat</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:32.070" style="s2">up though when you started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">Owen Barfield in a couple of talks cuz</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.070" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">he&#39;s a chap that has been very</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">inspirational to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s what he&#39;s done is he brought</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">a lot of things together for me or at</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:44.030" style="s2">least I guess found he helped me find a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">way to bring together a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.030" end="00:00:49.399" style="s2">which you know it&#39;s not unrelated to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">whole issue of the meaning of crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.399" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">I used to be a church England clergy</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">person for one thing and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">fell out of love with that left</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">I did a philosophy PhD on Plato spend</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">the whole time thinking that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">quite getting to grits law Plato was</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">saying even though I got the PhD</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">apparently fine I&#39;ve even got a past in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">physics my undergraduate degree was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">physics and and quite you know how that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:21.890" style="s2">fits into things again so he helped me</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">sort of bring together a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.890" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">primarily actually by this notion he had</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">of kind of unthinking what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">know mmm-hmm and seeing what pops up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">when you can do that and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">that starts to make more sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">Socrates it starts to make more sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">the crisis which we face now</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:46.310" style="s2">particularly within Christianity but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">think he&#39;s really presented as too</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.310" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">rational really you know as if X for as</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">wise fall is dead even in relatively</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">liberal traditions like my own so he</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">began to create kind of imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">space and the course imagination is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">big big thing football fields so he</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:07.990" style="s2">helped me to do yeah so there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:11.530" style="s2">things I&#39;d like to pick up on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.990" end="00:02:14.890" style="s2">well actually three but the first two</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.530" end="00:02:16.570" style="s2">that came to mind was you you reference</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.890" end="00:02:18.880" style="s2">the particular relationship you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.570" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">this pairs to Christianity and this this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.880" end="00:02:23.050" style="s2">brings up your recent book mark has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.100" style="s2">book out it&#39;s very well written by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.050" end="00:02:27.459" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.100" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">in fact I I find I I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.459" end="00:02:31.390" style="s2">convergent agreement with the book and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">lot of powerful ways but it&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.390" end="00:02:36.100" style="s2">beautifully written it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">secret history of Christianity is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.100" end="00:02:39.640" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">thanks and that I do recommend it I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:45.070" style="s2">think it&#39;s a very good read as you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:47.110" style="s2">many many of you know I&#39;m in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.070" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">with many people like Paul bender clay</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.110" end="00:02:54.100" style="s2">and Jonathan pazzo Mary Cohen JP Marceau</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">Christians and who are very attracted</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.100" end="00:03:00.340" style="s2">and interested in a very good faith way</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:00.970" style="s2">in my work and I am interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.340" end="00:03:02.770" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.970" end="00:03:05.830" style="s2">I&#39;m having this interesting dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.770" end="00:03:06.940" style="s2">with Christianity so the mention both</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.830" end="00:03:09.160" style="s2">points mark and then you can play with</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.940" end="00:03:11.860" style="s2">them as you wish and the first is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.160" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2">know what like you know you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.860" end="00:03:15.730" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.140" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">critical of Christianity in fact at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.730" end="00:03:18.220" style="s2">very beginning in the book I think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:19.780" style="s2">first sentence is something like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.220" end="00:03:22.120" style="s2">something wrong with Christianity today</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.780" end="00:03:24.190" style="s2">you start very critically so there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.120" end="00:03:27.370" style="s2">something wrong and then there&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.190" end="00:03:29.650" style="s2">difference of opinion or maybe view</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.370" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">ultimately about whether or not this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.650" end="00:03:35.310" style="s2">sickness unto death or whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know portends a potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:44.380" style="s2">reformulation or revival so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:46.209" style="s2">relationship to Christianity that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.380" end="00:03:48.549" style="s2">see Barfield and then how does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.209" end="00:03:50.860" style="s2">relate to you know the Nietzschean death</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.549" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">of God but also the more broadly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:54.549" style="s2">meaning crisis so I&#39;m giving you this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:55.570" style="s2">very loosely formulated question because</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.549" end="00:04:00.579" style="s2">I want to give you a lot of room to play</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.570" end="00:04:04.870" style="s2">in and then the other notion that came</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.579" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2">to mind is and these two terms because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.870" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">think and when you win when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.940" end="00:04:11.799" style="s2">talking about logos in your book and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:15.670" style="s2">believe because of Socrates the Athenian</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.799" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">Moses or the Moses of Athens and Barr</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.670" end="00:04:20.019" style="s2">fields critical of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">rationality I&#39;m very critical of what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.019" end="00:04:24.920" style="s2">call the Enlightenment know</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">of rationality and I&#39;ve tried to give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.920" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">notion that&#39;s much more Socratic is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:33.710" style="s2">adjective and then because that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:34.700" style="s2">modern notion of rationality and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.710" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to get to the term you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.700" end="00:04:38.200" style="s2">brought up but I want these two talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.380" end="00:04:40.670" style="s2">about together if possible please is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.200" end="00:04:43.640" style="s2">imagination because you&#39;re also using</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.670" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">imagination in a way that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.640" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">how it&#39;s commonly used or commonly</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">understood so the person that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:54.170" style="s2">most helpful for me on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:55.900" style="s2">apart from Barfield and Lachman</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.170" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">lachman&#39;s book was a very good book ah</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.900" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">lost knowledge of the imagination I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">believe it is what it&#39;s called is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:05.150" style="s2">especially the work of Corbin and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">the commentary and excellent work and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.150" end="00:05:08.660" style="s2">had a discussion with Thomas chief</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">enough about this the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.660" end="00:05:13.700" style="s2">distinction between the imaginal and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">merely imaginary so could you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.700" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">little I know I&#39;m giving you a lot here</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:20.270" style="s2">but I want to give you a lot of space to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:25.550" style="s2">play with so Christianity the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.270" end="00:05:28.310" style="s2">crisis Barfield right and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.550" end="00:05:30.230" style="s2">playing off against each other I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.310" end="00:05:32.770" style="s2">think they require sort of a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.230" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">reformulation imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.770" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">rationality or reason I had a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">excellent conversation about with Ian</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:41.930" style="s2">McGilchrist about this to the master</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:44.480" style="s2">news emissary so there&#39;s a lot there</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.930" end="00:05:45.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to feed you a lot so now well</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.480" end="00:05:47.330" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.170" end="00:05:49.970" style="s2">pick up in a couple of threads and see</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.330" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">where they go yeah I mean maybe start</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.970" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">where you ended up there and think</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:57.290" style="s2">because because Coleridge is another big</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:59.450" style="s2">name for yes yes yes yeah and encoder</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.290" end="00:06:01.940" style="s2">which is idea was that you can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.450" end="00:06:04.460" style="s2">difference between the imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.940" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">say mere fantasy which is to think a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:09.580" style="s2">like core bands difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:12.490" style="s2">imaginal and regular kind of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.580" end="00:06:15.800" style="s2">because the imaginable or imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.490" end="00:06:18.470" style="s2">with the capital i&#39; encoder rich it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.800" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">takes you somewhere it&#39;s not just sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.470" end="00:06:22.130" style="s2">of fun although it might be fun it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:24.320" style="s2">just playing on what you already know</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.130" end="00:06:27.170" style="s2">although it would do that but actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.320" end="00:06:29.060" style="s2">extends and develops and carries you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.170" end="00:06:31.640" style="s2">into new perceptions of reality new</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.060" end="00:06:35.180" style="s2">knowledge new awareness and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.640" end="00:06:37.400" style="s2">the reason reasons tasks is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.180" end="00:06:41.229" style="s2">discerning what the imagination throws</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.400" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">up again it&#39;s not its reason meant in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.229" end="00:06:47.630" style="s2">the sense of incorporating beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:50.630" style="s2">pattern yes and again this sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.630" end="00:06:52.750" style="s2">reach of experience and reality that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.630" end="00:06:56.090" style="s2">reason enables you to kind of relate to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.750" end="00:06:58.220" style="s2">more precisely rather than just is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.090" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">coherent illogical arabia&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.220" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">actually yeah so and then there&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:08.990" style="s2">the sort of theistic element which I</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:11.539" style="s2">have found a persuasive having kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.990" end="00:07:16.490" style="s2">gone through I can meet you in death of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.539" end="00:07:20.780" style="s2">God and try to find a way back which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.490" end="00:07:25.460" style="s2">that this must be a sharing I think with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.780" end="00:07:27.050" style="s2">a broader sense of insight these bar</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.460" end="00:07:29.270" style="s2">fills expression the inside of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.050" end="00:07:31.550" style="s2">world it&#39;s not something just going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.270" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">inside our own heads because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.550" end="00:07:36.380" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t really go anywhere it would</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.860" end="00:07:38.120" style="s2">just turn around in epicycles and sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.380" end="00:07:40.280" style="s2">of consume itself and sometimes feel a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.120" end="00:07:42.919" style="s2">bit exhausted sometimes a bit exciting</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.280" end="00:07:46.789" style="s2">but not really with a sense of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.919" end="00:07:49.400" style="s2">further inspired seeing as much as kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.789" end="00:07:52.520" style="s2">of enables you to to co-create with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.400" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">and so the code originally an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.520" end="00:07:57.169" style="s2">our imagination with the capital I and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">think this is in core band to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.169" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2">imaginal as actually taking us to Ward&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.900" end="00:08:05.509" style="s2">spirit not just amplifying our own inner</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.110" end="00:08:08.030" style="s2">life and that took me back in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.509" end="00:08:11.720" style="s2">direction of a theistic conception of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.030" end="00:08:13.430" style="s2">things so that&#39;s to say something about</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.720" end="00:08:16.490" style="s2">that sort of sighs I mean yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.430" end="00:08:18.669" style="s2">Christian bit particularly my criticism</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.490" end="00:08:21.250" style="s2">and this is very much my own story as</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.669" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">you know when I first started getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.250" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">involved in the church as an adult there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">was a big move around while</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:32.270" style="s2">demythologizing in one way to turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:34.779" style="s2">Christianity into sort of symbols for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.270" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">moral life mm-hmm and I feel very</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.779" end="00:08:41.469" style="s2">passionately against that now because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">think morality sets up laws and rules</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.469" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">and so it doesn&#39;t enable you to be free</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">really and it&#39;s all about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:51.589" style="s2">you know managing to sort of Richie</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:54.430" style="s2">Eve in your life rather than is your</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.589" end="00:08:57.589" style="s2">life really expanding and growing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.430" end="00:09:00.769" style="s2">judges but judges not so as to release</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.589" end="00:09:03.889" style="s2">you to something bigger but just purely</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.769" end="00:09:05.180" style="s2">to sort of keep you in place so that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.889" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">one side of Christianity that liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.180" end="00:09:09.529" style="s2">Christianity I knew the other side was</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">and the non realism of figures like Dom</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.529" end="00:09:15.320" style="s2">Cupid and who&#39;s still just about writing</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">I think and but he sort of felt that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.320" end="00:09:18.740" style="s2">know religious rituals are good for</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:22.130" style="s2">their own sake they kind of take you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.740" end="00:09:26.029" style="s2">outside yourself a bit and they enable</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.130" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">you to connect with place and history</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.029" end="00:09:30.829" style="s2">and that side of things they probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.649" style="s2">have some psychological benefit and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.829" end="00:09:35.540" style="s2">mean I can see that but again it felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.649" end="00:09:37.459" style="s2">like at the end of the day you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:39.639" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to kind of keep your own will</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.459" end="00:09:41.990" style="s2">assets you know you&#39;ve got to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.639" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">stir up the energy from within rather</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.990" end="00:09:47.750" style="s2">than energy coming from without it felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:51.079" style="s2">like a closed system rather than an open</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.750" end="00:09:54.589" style="s2">system and Barfield helped me with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.079" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">because what he tells is also a story of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.589" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">Christianity and why we&#39;ve come to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.500" end="00:10:01.579" style="s2">particular moment with Christianity you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:05.149" style="s2">know whether or not Christianity will</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.579" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">provide oh no it remains to be seen I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.149" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">think it could be that the the big</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:12.010" style="s2">Christian cycle you know that reached</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.810" style="s2">its culmination in the medieval period</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.010" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">is the Christian cycle and something</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.810" end="00:10:19.000" style="s2">else emerges now I&#39;m kind of open to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.890" style="s2">that possibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.000" end="00:10:26.570" style="s2">nonetheless he felt that what it did was</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.890" end="00:10:28.220" style="s2">it released a new way that we experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.570" end="00:10:30.709" style="s2">ourselves as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.220" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">particularly as individuals and by that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.709" end="00:10:35.329" style="s2">he meant that we have a rich kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:38.600" style="s2">inner life that we can claim to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.329" end="00:10:41.540" style="s2">substantial extent is our own that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.600" end="00:10:42.890" style="s2">have real choices over it and that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.540" end="00:10:45.740" style="s2">can therefore find a path for</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.890" end="00:10:48.440" style="s2">development through life and know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.740" end="00:10:50.300" style="s2">their inner life mirrors and the inner</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:52.910" style="s2">life ultimately of the divine you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.300" end="00:10:56.839" style="s2">the divine I am this in the monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.910" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">conception can be seen by the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.839" end="00:11:03.050" style="s2">that has a gathered sense of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:06.920" style="s2">if not can say I am themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.050" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">and that was tremendously energizing for</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.920" end="00:11:11.509" style="s2">the Christian period around the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:13.490" style="s2">Mediterranean particularly and it led to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.509" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">the great flourishing of medieval</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.490" end="00:11:19.819" style="s2">Christianity but went through a phase of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:22.790" style="s2">alienation in the early modern period</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.819" end="00:11:24.649" style="s2">and for Barfield alienation isn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.790" end="00:11:26.569" style="s2">isn&#39;t just bad it&#39;s both good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.649" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">it&#39;s got the bat outside which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.569" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">common the understood side that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:33.079" style="s2">creates the meaning crisis but he also</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:36.709" style="s2">thought that it throws you on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.079" end="00:11:39.430" style="s2">and if you can use the opportunity if</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.709" end="00:11:41.810" style="s2">you can sort of survive the struggle</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.430" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">actually deepens your own inner life</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.810" end="00:11:46.189" style="s2">with the potential then that opens back</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.680" style="s2">onto the inner life of all things with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.189" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">with a renewed consciousness and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.680" end="00:11:54.259" style="s2">renewed deliberation to do it but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:55.639" style="s2">renewed perceptions and so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.259" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">the question mark in a way that hangs</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.639" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">over our own time I think he thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:02.540" style="s2">that it happened with the birth of Greek</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:05.089" style="s2">philosophy and also the Hebrew prophets</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.540" end="00:12:07.670" style="s2">radical revolution I&#39;m Holdings going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.089" end="00:12:09.800" style="s2">back then it sort of found its</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.670" end="00:12:12.470" style="s2">culmination around the figure of Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.800" end="00:12:15.290" style="s2">particularly for those who turn to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.470" end="00:12:17.720" style="s2">Christianity became hugely productive</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.290" end="00:12:19.910" style="s2">fruitful and so on but you know again</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.720" end="00:12:21.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of cycle now where all</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.910" end="00:12:23.870" style="s2">this has kind of thrown into question</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.019" end="00:12:28.870" style="s2">with the good and the bad the fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.870" end="00:12:31.490" style="s2">produces that was really good</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.870" end="00:12:34.309" style="s2">no it&#39;s very good I enjoyed that very</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.490" end="00:12:38.990" style="s2">much so there was a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.309" end="00:12:41.809" style="s2">interesting things so you gave you used</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.990" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">a very very important term for me when</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.809" end="00:12:49.189" style="s2">you described reasons first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:51.319" style="s2">know the imagination as the education in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.189" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">the deep sense of to draw forth right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.319" end="00:12:56.540" style="s2">and like is it a perception which which</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:12:59.240" style="s2">are by the way is finding a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.540" end="00:13:01.250" style="s2">consonants within current cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:03.439" style="s2">science the relationship between imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.250" end="00:13:06.350" style="s2">imagination perception is much more like</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.439" end="00:13:08.269" style="s2">that than what we used to think so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.350" end="00:13:10.009" style="s2">think that&#39;s an important point you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.269" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">might want to come back to but you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.009" end="00:13:13.870" style="s2">that reason has they&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:16.189" style="s2">discernment which is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:16.400" style="s2">like because discernment of course is</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.189" end="00:13:18.140" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.400" end="00:13:20.810" style="s2">so a term about understanding and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.140" end="00:13:23.570" style="s2">it has the idea of seeing through what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.810" end="00:13:26.060" style="s2">a losery into what&#39;s real and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.570" end="00:13:27.830" style="s2">bringing in that you know that we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.060" end="00:13:30.440" style="s2">what well this is what I argue I think</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.440" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">fake fixation on sort of logical</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.960" end="00:13:38.990" style="s2">coherence to produce certain conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:40.700" style="s2">and I&#39;m doing certain like this instead</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.990" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2">we should make it back to what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.700" end="00:13:45.020" style="s2">Socrates and Plato which is as you say</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:47.900" style="s2">the training of discernment the ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.020" end="00:13:50.420" style="s2">to see through self-deception to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.900" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">through illusory aspects the way in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.420" end="00:13:53.990" style="s2">which things present themselves is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:13:55.520" style="s2">always the way they are the way we</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.990" end="00:13:57.530" style="s2">understand ourselves can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.520" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">fundamentally misleading or biased in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.530" end="00:14:00.740" style="s2">all kinds away and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:03.590" style="s2">very consonant I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.740" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">consonant but when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.590" end="00:14:08.200" style="s2">about Christ and Christianity and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:11.420" style="s2">can sort of the gathering together the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.200" end="00:14:13.580" style="s2">Kairos around him one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.420" end="00:14:15.020" style="s2">I didn&#39;t wanted to ask you is given</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.580" end="00:14:18.620" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s sort of a matter we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.020" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">together you know in imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.620" end="00:14:22.910" style="s2">reason as discernment as sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:24.590" style="s2">unified faculty and right and we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.910" end="00:14:26.360" style="s2">we won&#39;t name it but we&#39;ll say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:28.580" style="s2">there is this faculty is that okay or</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.360" end="00:14:33.290" style="s2">are you okay with them and then what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.580" end="00:14:35.170" style="s2">want to know is you&#39;ll see why what this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.290" end="00:14:38.270" style="s2">what this has to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.170" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">participation and especially post axial</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.270" end="00:14:42.890" style="s2">reciprocal what you call reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:46.340" style="s2">participation following Barfield as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.890" end="00:14:47.930" style="s2">know I think I quite independently came</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.340" end="00:14:51.050" style="s2">to the notion of participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.930" end="00:14:52.970" style="s2">through 14 Karzai and I and there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.050" end="00:14:55.610" style="s2">and that&#39;s how I asked how I came to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.970" end="00:14:57.410" style="s2">Barfield I came to Barfield through I</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.610" end="00:14:58.850" style="s2">was searching about anybody who had been</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.410" end="00:15:01.130" style="s2">talking about this and of course I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.850" end="00:15:03.110" style="s2">thrown into Plato and people but then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:05.870" style="s2">get Barfield came up that&#39;s how I came</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.110" end="00:15:07.910" style="s2">to Barfield actually through that and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.870" end="00:15:10.430" style="s2">I want to talk about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.910" end="00:15:13.510" style="s2">between this reason imagination</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:15.830" style="s2">imagination reason faculty and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.510" end="00:15:18.530" style="s2">participation participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.830" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">reciprocal participation in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.530" end="00:15:26.390" style="s2">because I think reciprocal participation</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:29.540" style="s2">is seeing an important revival in these</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.390" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">two notions of reciprocal narrowing in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.540" end="00:15:32.029" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:33.880" style="s2">addiction which should be thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.029" end="00:15:36.019" style="s2">existential and not merely psychological</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.880" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">their psychological of course but</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.019" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">they&#39;re not merely psychological their</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">existential as well right and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">opposite reciprocal opening which right</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:49.250" style="s2">has a lot to do with meaning in life and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.860" end="00:15:50.660" style="s2">I like your point also and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.250" end="00:15:53.060" style="s2">stop talking so you can talk some more</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.660" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">that and trying to reduce religion to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.060" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">morality which is still a strong impulse</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:16:00.620" style="s2">today I think is deeply mistaken because</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.990" style="s2">I think that sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.620" end="00:16:05.570" style="s2">religio which i think has an important</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.990" end="00:16:07.310" style="s2">role within reciprocal participation has</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.570" end="00:16:09.459" style="s2">a lot more to do with meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.310" end="00:16:12.019" style="s2">and meaning in life is about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.459" end="00:16:15.019" style="s2">fundamental sense of connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.019" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s neither the passive</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.019" end="00:16:19.700" style="s2">reception of empiricism nor the active</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.769" style="s2">projection of at least four so Ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.700" end="00:16:23.240" style="s2">romanticism you and I differ differ a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.769" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">little bit about how but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.240" end="00:16:27.589" style="s2">agree with me that Rousseau at least has</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:29.420" style="s2">this you know this is the this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.589" end="00:16:32.089" style="s2">Romanticism that&#39;s very much about sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.420" end="00:16:34.370" style="s2">of expressing right and painting on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.089" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">empty canvas of the world and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.370" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">notion of connectedness that people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:41.089" style="s2">seeking in meaning in life is neither</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">that path that purely passive or that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.089" end="00:16:46.699" style="s2">purely aggressive one and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:49.579" style="s2">and in his book on Owen Barfield Aoife</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.699" end="00:16:52.430" style="s2">zuzia actually brings this out as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.579" end="00:16:54.140" style="s2">really important point about Barr fields</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.430" end="00:16:56.089" style="s2">notion of participation so there again</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to give you a bunch because</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.089" end="00:17:00.110" style="s2">the last time I gave you a lot with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">so go again work that was good luck yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">thank you yeah I mean I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">say and those distinctions are right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:11.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve never liked the roost own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">Romanticism I mean Barfield actually he</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.030" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">felt the romanticism needs to come of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:17.150" style="s2">age as he put it and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:19.939" style="s2">that is his criticism of Rousseau but</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.150" end="00:17:21.980" style="s2">also the tendency in say words worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.939" end="00:17:24.199" style="s2">just to kind of fall back on wonder or</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.980" end="00:17:25.790" style="s2">mystery yeah I&#39;m and to enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.199" end="00:17:27.890" style="s2">sentiment but not really be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.790" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">much more obvious yeah although</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.890" end="00:17:34.490" style="s2">Wordsworth is a genius but yes though I</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:38.660" style="s2">mean actually just to throw in another</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.490" end="00:17:40.130" style="s2">little bit of my own bio biography</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.660" end="00:17:42.290" style="s2">because this in a way it&#39;s a keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.130" end="00:17:43.970" style="s2">practice for me and I know the Kratz is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.290" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">becoming more important for you as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.970" end="00:17:51.350" style="s2">I work as a psychotherapist my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:52.669" style="s2">everyday certainly the way I you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.350" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">earn a living is is through</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.669" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">psychotherapy and a key figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:01.370" style="s2">well there&#39;s both the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:04.850" style="s2">biographical elements of that is that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.370" end="00:18:06.919" style="s2">was undergoing my own therapy and planta</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.850" end="00:18:09.409" style="s2">in part of the training that made me</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.919" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">realize that you can take your own inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.409" end="00:18:14.809" style="s2">life seriously and it really does tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">you something and what it tells you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.809" end="00:18:19.330" style="s2">see if you can grapple with what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:22.130" style="s2">seems to be saying that extends your</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.330" end="00:18:25.700" style="s2">participation in life mm-hmm so rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.130" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">than you know say being defensive about</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.700" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">life and trying to hold on to your own</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">conception of things which you know can</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:36.620" style="s2">come about for all sorts of quite good</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:38.840" style="s2">reasons nonetheless it restricts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.620" end="00:18:41.870" style="s2">limits life and whereas understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.840" end="00:18:44.179" style="s2">your defenses and more positively</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.870" end="00:18:46.750" style="s2">understanding that your your fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.179" end="00:18:48.980" style="s2">and can connect with reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.750" end="00:18:50.419" style="s2">juxtaposition of figures that I quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.980" end="00:18:52.460" style="s2">like here I find helpful is between</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.419" end="00:18:54.110" style="s2">Freud on the one hand and Donald</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.460" end="00:18:56.510" style="s2">Winnicott on the other yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.110" end="00:18:59.990" style="s2">very significant british psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.510" end="00:19:01.940" style="s2">it&#39;s very important and he is a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.990" end="00:19:04.580" style="s2">figure but in that romance doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.940" end="00:19:07.640" style="s2">of age sense and because what Winnicott</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.580" end="00:19:11.059" style="s2">said unlike freud is that our inner life</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.640" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">can&#39;t just be the sublimation of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.059" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">inner fears kind of on to the sky say in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">the case of religion and to try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:19.970" style="s2">contain the anxiety we have about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:21.770" style="s2">paternal figures or maternal figures or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.970" end="00:19:23.929" style="s2">whatever it might be you know try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.770" end="00:19:26.539" style="s2">reach some accommodation with these</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.929" end="00:19:28.760" style="s2">things that we fear because Winnicott</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.539" end="00:19:31.059" style="s2">said we&#39;d all be mad if that was so and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.760" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">whilst we can be mad some of the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.059" end="00:19:35.750" style="s2">we&#39;re not mad all of the time and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:38.690" style="s2">thought that must mean that our</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.750" end="00:19:40.580" style="s2">fantasies actually connect with wider</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.690" end="00:19:42.919" style="s2">reality so that we have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.580" end="00:19:45.320" style="s2">feeling grounded feeling up home feeling</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:47.030" style="s2">that we&#39;ve really learned something and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.320" end="00:19:50.270" style="s2">I haven&#39;t just conjured another fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.030" end="00:19:53.169" style="s2">out of thin air and I think that so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.270" end="00:19:56.899" style="s2">sense of how the projections out</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.169" end="00:19:58.279" style="s2">actually can inspire back none it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.899" end="00:20:00.619" style="s2">really important</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.279" end="00:20:04.190" style="s2">for understanding how we can be creative</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.619" end="00:20:07.639" style="s2">how the imagination can really you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.190" end="00:20:09.559" style="s2">create works of art that last that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.639" end="00:20:11.419" style="s2">seemed to give us more life that give us</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.559" end="00:20:14.239" style="s2">energy all this kind of side of it as</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.419" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">well and I think you&#39;ve got that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.239" end="00:20:17.809" style="s2">Plato too because just to pick up a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">little bit on how that connects back</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.809" end="00:20:22.129" style="s2">with ancient Greek philosophy I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:23.269" style="s2">think what are things which Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.129" end="00:20:27.259" style="s2">showed me actually but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.269" end="00:20:28.519" style="s2">important in Plato actually to realize</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.259" end="00:20:31.549" style="s2">that he didn&#39;t even have words like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.519" end="00:20:33.769" style="s2">analysis you know that was that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.549" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">Aristotelian neologism and and words</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.769" end="00:20:39.259" style="s2">like theory for Plato mean a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:40.850" style="s2">journey that you go on the OREA but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.259" end="00:20:43.639" style="s2">completely changes your perception of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.850" end="00:20:45.470" style="s2">things it is a participative yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.639" end="00:20:46.970" style="s2">just think it&#39;s not like a vague idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.470" end="00:20:50.330" style="s2">you have in your head that you somehow</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.970" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">put to the empirical test and so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:54.619" style="s2">know analogy is really important in</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:57.320" style="s2">Plato and what he tries to do is use</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.619" end="00:20:59.989" style="s2">reason to sort of test you know your</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.320" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">kind of immediate ideas to the breaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.989" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">point to the a Poirier and then hold</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:07.580" style="s2">that moment and maybe you do another one</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:08.929" style="s2">and you sort of test that&#39;s the break</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.580" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2">its own in one dialogue you might have</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.929" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">you know a whole bunch of ideas that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:15.649" style="s2">test and it&#39;s the gaps it&#39;s the crack</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">that lets the lighting yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.649" end="00:21:19.879" style="s2">felt very similar to me you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:21.259" style="s2">modern psychotherapy in fact really the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.879" end="00:21:22.789" style="s2">reason one of the reasons why I became</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.259" end="00:21:25.100" style="s2">psychotherapists rather than say an</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.789" end="00:21:27.799" style="s2">academic philosopher was I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.100" end="00:21:29.869" style="s2">the work on yourself was as important in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.799" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">ancient philosophy you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.869" end="00:21:32.359" style="s2">resonate you&#39;ve gotta be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">participate with the heads around you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.359" end="00:21:35.239" style="s2">and it seems to me this early</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.489" style="s2">anglo-american analytic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.239" end="00:21:39.529" style="s2">really had no conception of that at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.489" end="00:21:43.190" style="s2">it had what you might call physics Envy</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.529" end="00:21:45.710" style="s2">yes just the throwing one nice little</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.190" end="00:21:48.669" style="s2">biographical element there as well I did</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.710" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">this physics degree and my physics tutor</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.669" end="00:21:55.909" style="s2">he worked on dark dark energy and when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.889" style="s2">was doing my physics almost 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.909" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">he had a poster outside his wall outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.889" end="00:22:01.639" style="s2">his office saying dark energy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.859" style="s2">exist and I go and see him every so</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.639" end="00:22:05.269" style="s2">often now cuz they be softer now right</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.859" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">so I mean journalistically about physics</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.269" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">or cosmology and he still has that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:11.510" style="s2">poster there you know so he - who knows</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:14.420" style="s2">that physics Envy</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.510" end="00:22:15.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really even exist and and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">was another lesson I learned from him so</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.920" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">yeah this sense of you know with analogy</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:26.060" style="s2">openness reason sort of testing you need</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">to have I mean I like the metaphor the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.060" end="00:22:30.860" style="s2">Vic and Stein used to to move into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:33.430" style="s2">unknown you have to have the firm walls</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.860" end="00:22:36.350" style="s2">of the well to lower yourself down in</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.430" end="00:22:38.630" style="s2">and so you need something you know to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.350" end="00:22:40.670" style="s2">on and reason does provide that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.630" end="00:22:43.430" style="s2">other things too but it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.670" end="00:22:45.470" style="s2">constantly I think have this open this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.430" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">within it and that is where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.470" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">participation happens right because</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">that&#39;s when you feel the connection and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.050" style="s2">it you know works both thank you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:57.080" style="s2">therapeutically and I think works</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.050" end="00:23:00.140" style="s2">culturally what so that&#39;s great there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.080" end="00:23:01.460" style="s2">a couple things then I want to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.140" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">on now there&#39;s so much what you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:06.350" style="s2">said but hopefully we&#39;ll get I like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">the you sort of did this when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.350" end="00:23:11.060" style="s2">brought in Plato and you were also</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:12.740" style="s2">talking about right resonance and one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.060" end="00:23:14.300" style="s2">the things that&#39;s one of those shifts</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.740" end="00:23:15.410" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t talk enough about in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.300" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">series I&#39;m gonna talk a lot more about</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.410" end="00:23:21.610" style="s2">in after Socrates is the shift in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:24.290" style="s2">from dialogue to monologue in Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.610" end="00:23:26.740" style="s2">because part of what you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.290" end="00:23:29.000" style="s2">there and and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.740" end="00:23:30.860" style="s2">psychotherapeutic analogy and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.000" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">use the word as seriously as you do if</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.860" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:38.180" style="s2">analogy is very pertinent the idea about</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.950" style="s2">you know things that and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.180" end="00:23:42.470" style="s2">think how one of the ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.950" end="00:23:44.210" style="s2">imaginal differs from for korban not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.470" end="00:23:46.310" style="s2">always but one of the ways from just the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.210" end="00:23:48.650" style="s2">imaginary the images that come up and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.310" end="00:23:51.410" style="s2">catch they catch because they afford</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.650" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">this dialogic relationship between us in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.410" end="00:23:55.910" style="s2">the world not only as you said are they</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">projections outward from us they afford</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.910" end="00:24:01.310" style="s2">the universe you know speaking to us now</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.290" style="s2">in in both ways the active sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.310" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">giving us an insight disclosing</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.290" end="00:24:08.060" style="s2">something but also calling to us giving</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">a sense of you know portending a sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.060" end="00:24:12.890" style="s2">of a more Ness and a demand on us to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">other than what we are you know will cos</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:18.110" style="s2">famous line you know after looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">the the the work of art the the I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.110" end="00:24:21.620" style="s2">was the torso of Apollo idiot you must</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:23.870" style="s2">change your life right that sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.620" end="00:24:25.370" style="s2">must change your life and so that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.870" end="00:24:27.110" style="s2">me that&#39;s sort of a touch</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.370" end="00:24:30.920" style="s2">how the imaginal differs from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.110" end="00:24:32.900" style="s2">imaginary the imaginal it you know it it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.920" end="00:24:36.020" style="s2">catches us it in that though suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.900" end="00:24:37.970" style="s2">the world suddenly speaks through and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.020" end="00:24:40.160" style="s2">and and in both senses we get oh I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.970" end="00:24:43.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t see that and also oh I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.160" end="00:24:46.850" style="s2">called beyond myself in ways I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.220" end="00:24:48.470" style="s2">and and that bad for example comes up</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">I&#39;m doing a lot of work with that Chris</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.470" end="00:24:53.780" style="s2">master Pietro and I send stock and</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.780" end="00:24:57.830" style="s2">goes well you get where you get into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">conversation with somebody and it starts</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.830" end="00:25:02.090" style="s2">to have those features the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.800" style="s2">takes on a logo so life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.090" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">you start getting those insights that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.800" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">sense of insight and calling not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:08.420" style="s2">from each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:10.550" style="s2">but the conversation of a as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.420" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">feels like it starts to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.550" end="00:25:15.890" style="s2">dialogue with sort of the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:20.600" style="s2">intelligibility the depths of being and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.890" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">so I think um why I&#39;m talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.600" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">and to bring it back to Barfield and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">bring it back to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:30.650" style="s2">about sort of art and imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:33.620" style="s2">discernment and maybe this will also get</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.650" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">us back into to religion it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.620" end="00:25:39.170" style="s2">what I see right is also a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:41.720" style="s2">attitude towards language that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.170" end="00:25:43.400" style="s2">when you get into that mode that mode</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.720" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to talk about where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.400" end="00:25:47.000" style="s2">know to use one of Plato&#39;s metaphors it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:48.920" style="s2">goes back to Heraclitus what it take</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:53.990" style="s2">when it catches fire right and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.920" end="00:25:57.650" style="s2">got that um and what I see in is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.990" end="00:26:00.800" style="s2">of a lot of the prophets are talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.650" end="00:26:03.080" style="s2">about images and that&#39;s important until</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.800" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">it does and you know obviously Young</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.080" end="00:26:09.920" style="s2">does for man but I see what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:11.420" style="s2">specific about Barfield and also this</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.920" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">puts him into an important dialogue with</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">is this turn towards language but not</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.810" end="00:26:21.860" style="s2">but but a turn about a turn and yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.630" end="00:26:24.350" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.860" end="00:26:26.150" style="s2">reorientation about how we participate</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.350" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">in language and how we understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.150" end="00:26:30.650" style="s2">language and and part of the few CEA&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:33.140" style="s2">argument is in fact he thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.650" end="00:26:35.900" style="s2">Barfield does a better job at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.140" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">return to language then Heidegger does</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.900" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">and well and I noticed you you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:41.900" style="s2">sort of similar aspects run</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:44.390" style="s2">to your work I wonder if you could speak</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.900" end="00:26:46.340" style="s2">to that um you know that this general</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.390" end="00:26:47.690" style="s2">theme of if you&#39;ll allow me this a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.340" end="00:26:49.190" style="s2">of putting it because you use the term</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.690" end="00:26:51.560" style="s2">as well in your book and it also has</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.190" end="00:26:53.780" style="s2">Christian resonance recovering the logos</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.560" end="00:26:55.670" style="s2">remember Heraclitus famously said don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.780" end="00:26:57.470" style="s2">listen to me but listen to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.670" end="00:26:57.980" style="s2">right in my words and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.470" end="00:26:59.930" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.980" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">what is the logos in language and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.930" end="00:27:03.650" style="s2">is it to listen to the logos is that a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:05.690" style="s2">fan of question do you think yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.650" end="00:27:08.060" style="s2">let me say somethings about it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.690" end="00:27:10.130" style="s2">think one of the reasons why I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.060" end="00:27:12.740" style="s2">baffled may do a better job in Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.130" end="00:27:16.970" style="s2">and say that nervously cuz you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.740" end="00:27:18.980" style="s2">Heidegger it&#39;s a big figure but is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:23.920" style="s2">think that he doesn&#39;t have a high kick</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.980" end="00:27:27.350" style="s2">hiding its hatred of Plato yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.920" end="00:27:29.780" style="s2">mean the I think Plato understood</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.350" end="00:27:32.510" style="s2">reciprocal participation yeah in a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.780" end="00:27:34.490" style="s2">that comes out of the pre-socratics and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.510" end="00:27:37.190" style="s2">comes out of Heraclitus and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.490" end="00:27:40.310" style="s2">Heidegger felt the need to reject for</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.190" end="00:27:42.740" style="s2">one reason and another I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.310" end="00:27:45.050" style="s2">it&#39;s actually that much just the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.740" end="00:27:47.960" style="s2">state of academic philosophy at the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.050" end="00:27:50.180" style="s2">actually but anyway that&#39;s perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.960" end="00:27:52.160" style="s2">can I interrupt for just one point</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.180" end="00:27:53.750" style="s2">because there&#39;s a I&#39;ve just in the midst</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.160" end="00:27:55.880" style="s2">of reading a really good book by rock</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.750" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">Kowski called Heidegger&#39;s Platonism</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.880" end="00:28:00.560" style="s2">where he makes the argument that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:04.120" style="s2">Heidegger who&#39;s lecturing on the cave</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.560" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">analogy in the 30s has a really positive</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.120" end="00:28:07.910" style="s2">attitude towards Plato and seems to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:09.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about here the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.910" end="00:28:11.420" style="s2">reciprocal opening and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.410" end="00:28:16.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s only and but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.420" end="00:28:18.500" style="s2">shift that comes out later and when he</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.070" end="00:28:20.030" style="s2">writes to the you know that the thing on</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.500" end="00:28:22.460" style="s2">Plato and the essence of truth where as</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.030" end="00:28:24.440" style="s2">you say he makes Plato the villain and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.460" end="00:28:26.870" style="s2">and so there seems to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.440" end="00:28:29.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s to be an original deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.870" end="00:28:31.610" style="s2">appreciation and Heidegger of Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.480" end="00:28:33.530" style="s2">then there&#39;s a rejection and wachowski</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:36.830" style="s2">actually argues that if Heidegger had</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.530" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">stayed true to what that original he</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.830" end="00:28:40.910" style="s2">might not have made his serious his most</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.250" style="s2">serious mistake which was getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.910" end="00:28:44.420" style="s2">involved with the Nazis so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.250" end="00:28:47.210" style="s2">to put that out there as a potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.420" end="00:28:48.680" style="s2">resource for people to consider but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.210" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">think your overall point is right that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.680" end="00:28:52.990" style="s2">Heidegger right turns on Plato in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:56.770" style="s2">important way</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.990" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">please mark well I think dad about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:02.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s you know I feel the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:05.159" style="s2">of Plato alive and I get upset actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:07.539" style="s2">when people just go for him but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.159" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">yet but the words what sort of words</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.539" end="00:29:13.299" style="s2">point picking up that and what Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:14.919" style="s2">says about that is well actually I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.299" end="00:29:16.809" style="s2">I think in other words when I go so</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.919" end="00:29:18.909" style="s2">deeper Barford is that words were his</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.809" end="00:29:23.549" style="s2">material yeah you know he was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.909" end="00:29:26.440" style="s2">philologist he realized that if words</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.549" end="00:29:29.080" style="s2">enlightened our consciousness now as</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.440" end="00:29:31.240" style="s2">they do particularly in poetry and by</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:34.600" style="s2">that he meant that the poet&#39;s task in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.240" end="00:29:37.419" style="s2">way is to put words together that he</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.600" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">familiarizes them but so is that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.419" end="00:29:41.020" style="s2">releases the energy or the in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:43.870" style="s2">meaning the felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.020" end="00:29:46.840" style="s2">yeah Alchemist of the word I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.870" end="00:29:49.149" style="s2">fresh way I mean revivify his words so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.840" end="00:29:52.570" style="s2">prose can be quite poetic but the poet</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.149" end="00:29:54.549" style="s2">just goes for that complete her so he</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:56.919" style="s2">thought that words have a kind of soul</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.549" end="00:30:00.130" style="s2">or which just means a vitality and inner</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.919" end="00:30:01.870" style="s2">life and that words come from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.130" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">you know they speak us as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.870" end="00:30:05.740" style="s2">speak then we co-create with words and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:10.090" style="s2">so again this takes him to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.740" end="00:30:11.770" style="s2">inner life of the worlds the cosmos but</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.090" end="00:30:14.440" style="s2">with this balance that we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.770" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">do something with them you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.440" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">sense of reciprocal participation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.399" style="s2">you know this then takes them but this</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">is where he gets his story from about</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.399" end="00:30:28.750" style="s2">the rise and fall of the ways of human</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:31.210" style="s2">consciousness that if words now carry</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">something about inner vitality then if</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.210" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">we can track back the way were to change</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:37.659" style="s2">meaning then they can become what he</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">called fossils of consciousness and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.659" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">can understand how things have changed</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">and so can also use them to tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:48.309" style="s2">of now as well as just try and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:49.539" style="s2">experience now yeah so I forget where we</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.309" end="00:30:51.309" style="s2">started on that but that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.539" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">about the Offit of words and why there</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.309" end="00:30:54.460" style="s2">was so central they were both his</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:55.870" style="s2">evidence if you like he didn&#39;t just sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.460" end="00:30:59.169" style="s2">of imagine this he didn&#39;t just receive</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.870" end="00:31:00.340" style="s2">it as if he was mystic and this was</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.169" end="00:31:02.230" style="s2">actually quite common in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.340" end="00:31:04.120" style="s2">century to realize that there is a story</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.230" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">can tell about the developments of words</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.120" end="00:31:09.160" style="s2">so I was very struck the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.800" style="s2">figures as diverse as Jeremy Bentham and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.160" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">Ralph Waldo Emerson are both realized</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.800" end="00:31:16.210" style="s2">that words change meaning in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:17.140" style="s2">you can actually track and they tell you</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.210" end="00:31:19.660" style="s2">something about the shift of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.140" end="00:31:22.360" style="s2">consciousness and particularly about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.660" end="00:31:24.580" style="s2">sense of how you know human inner life</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.360" end="00:31:26.680" style="s2">and inner life in the world around once</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.580" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">felt quite connected and that&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.680" end="00:31:30.400" style="s2">where language comes from and then it</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:33.100" style="s2">goes through these periods of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.400" end="00:31:34.810" style="s2">disconnected which is expressed in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.100" end="00:31:37.960" style="s2">changing change meanings of words as</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.810" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">well so that way that was very good Mike</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:42.160" style="s2">I like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:43.390" style="s2">just to bring it back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.160" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">thread the original thread was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.390" end="00:31:50.110" style="s2">comparison of a Barfield and Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:51.880" style="s2">on this return to language and that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.110" end="00:31:53.290" style="s2">know you know Heidegger has this notion</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.880" end="00:31:57.040" style="s2">that languages the house over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.290" end="00:32:01.890" style="s2">shepherd of being kind of thing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.040" end="00:32:04.870" style="s2">defeats here seems to argue that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.890" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2">Heidegger is attitude towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.870" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s kind of like the criticism</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:09.490" style="s2">you&#39;re making of Woodsworth</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:13.870" style="s2">it&#39;s very much the glass indict it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.490" end="00:32:19.510" style="s2">letting be and it&#39;s letting go but he</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.870" end="00:32:21.460" style="s2">thinks that that is I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.510" end="00:32:23.350" style="s2">too technical here but the idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.460" end="00:32:25.150" style="s2">know and you talk about this in the book</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.350" end="00:32:26.760" style="s2">your book too you know the subject has</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.150" end="00:32:29.290" style="s2">become sort of determinate of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.760" end="00:32:31.990" style="s2">objectivity it&#39;s a very Cartesian model</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.290" end="00:32:33.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very much about the will to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.990" end="00:32:35.380" style="s2">power an imposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:36.580" style="s2">and then Heidegger is trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.380" end="00:32:38.920" style="s2">out of that but what he does is he just</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.580" end="00:32:41.710" style="s2">sort of company Australia he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.920" end="00:32:45.670" style="s2">get the individual as willis as possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.710" end="00:32:47.590" style="s2">the lassen height um and that that to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.670" end="00:32:49.900" style="s2">strikes that&#39;s kind of ironic because</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.590" end="00:32:51.190" style="s2">the terms like Heidegger&#39;s still bound</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.900" end="00:32:53.560" style="s2">to the very grammar</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.190" end="00:32:55.240" style="s2">he&#39;s just negating it and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.560" end="00:32:56.560" style="s2">ironic because that&#39;s the criticism he</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.240" end="00:32:58.750" style="s2">made of Nietzsche that Nietzsche doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.560" end="00:33:01.270" style="s2">really escape Ando theology he merely</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.750" end="00:33:04.420" style="s2">inverts it and the fusee argues that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.270" end="00:33:05.680" style="s2">Barfield goes beyond Heidegger and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.420" end="00:33:08.350" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t get through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.680" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2">glass in height so if we&#39;re gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.350" end="00:33:12.160" style="s2">cart there&#39;s not only glass in height</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.600" end="00:33:13.930" style="s2">there&#39;s dirt Brooke there&#39;s breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.160" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like you said there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.930" end="00:33:20.200" style="s2">just this there&#39;s also the calling forth</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">and the drawing for and so if you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.200" end="00:33:25.960" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:28.630" style="s2">that Barfield sort of brings back the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.960" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">the participatory creativity within</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.630" end="00:33:34.600" style="s2">logos that&#39;s missing from Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:36.010" style="s2">and and so he Barfield has this notion</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.600" end="00:33:37.900" style="s2">that you&#39;ll allow me one of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.010" end="00:33:41.620" style="s2">neologisms that&#39;s much more trans</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.900" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">ejected about about this that when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.620" end="00:33:46.840" style="s2">using language and you I think you said</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:49.300" style="s2">it earlier you know it it&#39;s being Co</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.840" end="00:33:53.020" style="s2">determined its Co creative and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.300" end="00:33:55.860" style="s2">just us letting go and letting be but</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.020" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also dirt Brooke breaking through</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.860" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.440" style="s2">difference at least that as diffuse&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:03.640" style="s2">argues what do you think about that do</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.440" end="00:34:07.179" style="s2">you think it&#39;s a fair reading of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.640" end="00:34:09.490" style="s2">Barfield yeah no I mean it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.179" end="00:34:12.460" style="s2">two things that Barfield discusses one</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.490" end="00:34:16.419" style="s2">is what it takes to make a new word a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.460" end="00:34:18.340" style="s2">new word that really really lasts isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.419" end="00:34:20.080" style="s2">just a sort of technical term the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.340" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">captures something for a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.080" end="00:34:24.490" style="s2">people but and of course any people like</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:27.700" style="s2">Plato and Aristotle are great coin is of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.490" end="00:34:31.510" style="s2">new words yeah the you know that now we</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.700" end="00:34:33.399" style="s2">just assume yeah ah consciousness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.510" end="00:34:35.070" style="s2">yeah yeah and and but he says you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.399" end="00:34:38.740" style="s2">that that&#39;s a struggle that&#39;s an effort</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.070" end="00:34:42.580" style="s2">and and that is you know as it were</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.740" end="00:34:44.500" style="s2">bringing down into language something</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.580" end="00:34:47.710" style="s2">that enables you to see it and to focus</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.500" end="00:34:51.330" style="s2">on it but then provides the life of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.710" end="00:34:53.590" style="s2">words so that&#39;s one one excellent part</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.330" end="00:34:55.060" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.590" end="00:34:57.310" style="s2">that&#39;s excellent thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.060" end="00:34:59.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.310" end="00:35:01.240" style="s2">exemplification thank you sorry please</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.800" end="00:35:03.130" style="s2">continue yeah yeah and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.240" end="00:35:05.350" style="s2">thing another another take on it which I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">really like and there&#39;s really come</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.350" end="00:35:12.070" style="s2">alive for me actually is author doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:13.540" style="s2">talk a lot about Dante but um I Dante</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.070" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">has been important part of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.540" end="00:35:17.740" style="s2">psychotherapy story actually you know I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.330" end="00:35:19.330" style="s2">think so I could hope you can very good</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.740" end="00:35:20.770" style="s2">it take you into the inferno but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.330" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">not quite sure how to get you up through</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:25.869" style="s2">purgatory and and Dante&#39;s helped me do</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:31.420" style="s2">that and I think one of things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.869" end="00:35:33.900" style="s2">Dante realized is that what really takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.420" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">you into paradise how</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.900" end="00:35:40.080" style="s2">you understand that is when your will</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:43.350" style="s2">your sight your desire your knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.080" end="00:35:45.030" style="s2">and your awareness chimes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.350" end="00:35:46.740" style="s2">and more with you know he would call it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.030" end="00:35:48.600" style="s2">the divine and site design knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:52.380" style="s2">awareness and so on but you can call it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.600" end="00:35:55.890" style="s2">the logos as well and but it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.380" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">freely it&#39;s done because you&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.890" end="00:36:02.040" style="s2">on yourself and you can sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:04.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no greater enjoyment of the will</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.040" end="00:36:08.040" style="s2">desire sight knowledge and so on then</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.230" end="00:36:10.110" style="s2">when it chimes with the cosmos what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.040" end="00:36:11.580" style="s2">also interesting in Dante is that when</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.110" end="00:36:13.830" style="s2">he gets into paradise warnings that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.580" end="00:36:16.440" style="s2">rather shocks him at first is that he</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.830" end="00:36:18.330" style="s2">still sees lots of individual souls in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.440" end="00:36:21.030" style="s2">paradise he doesn&#39;t just sort of see a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.330" end="00:36:22.650" style="s2">kind of divine much and it takes in</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.030" end="00:36:25.350" style="s2">quite a lot of time through the paradise</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.650" end="00:36:28.140" style="s2">to really appreciate that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.350" end="00:36:30.600" style="s2">diversity in unity and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.140" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">kind of harmony I mean which resonates a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2">lot with what people say about non dual</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:39.210" style="s2">perception and soul and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:40.770" style="s2">another really important notion that I I</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.210" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">remember when you&#39;re talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.770" end="00:36:47.250" style="s2">the will in Heidegger that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:50.790" style="s2">an intensification of will in Dante but</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.250" end="00:36:52.530" style="s2">with this alignment as well yeah with</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.790" end="00:36:54.420" style="s2">the greater will and what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.530" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">greater flourishing of the world could</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.420" end="00:36:59.430" style="s2">the beers are worth and to be aligned</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">with the divine will so it&#39;s yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.430" end="00:37:03.540" style="s2">something about that going on as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">which I found very that sort of the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.540" end="00:37:09.870" style="s2">that Dante actually sees these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.080" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">it feels very fruitful for me okay so</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.870" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">that brings up something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:14.270" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:17.010" style="s2">all right before I forget guys everyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.270" end="00:37:19.800" style="s2">mark has a video series where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.010" end="00:37:21.780" style="s2">taking people through Dante so please</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.800" end="00:37:22.950" style="s2">check it out just a little plug for you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.780" end="00:37:25.020" style="s2">there Marcus you&#39;re doing done thank you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:27.270" style="s2">very much well I really hope I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.020" end="00:37:29.340" style="s2">believe that you know Dan says many</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.270" end="00:37:32.760" style="s2">things but if it&#39;s not read as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.340" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">spirity transformative text the key</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.760" end="00:37:36.360" style="s2">thing even I would say is being missed</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.460" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been trying to do that so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.360" end="00:37:40.770" style="s2">brings up something that I think will</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.460" end="00:37:42.600" style="s2">deepen the the critical comparison</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.770" end="00:37:44.550" style="s2">because when we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.600" end="00:37:47.790" style="s2">way we&#39;re right we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.550" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">Dante right and of course we&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.790" end="00:37:54.300" style="s2">an idea here we&#39;re getting this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:55.950" style="s2">you know a will a willing and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.300" end="00:37:57.780" style="s2">willingness it&#39;s both a willing and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.950" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">willingness that is sensing as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.780" end="00:38:02.250" style="s2">sitting this affinity this affinity and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.330" end="00:38:06.750" style="s2">conformity with the divine and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.250" end="00:38:10.650" style="s2">sacred and so right and the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.750" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">we normally understand that voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.650" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">binding ourselves to something that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:19.290" style="s2">sense an affinity to right is love right</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.510" style="s2">and you know and love is that love is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.290" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">how we in the end of the work of and on</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.510" end="00:38:25.800" style="s2">another that&#39;s how we experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:28.020" style="s2">reciprocal opening and what I see and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.800" end="00:38:29.850" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying and you know one way</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.020" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">of understanding Christianity especially</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.850" end="00:38:34.620" style="s2">in the figure of Christ is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:36.600" style="s2">integration of logos and love together</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.620" end="00:38:38.910" style="s2">and that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a theme in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.600" end="00:38:40.470" style="s2">Dante too but we can explore that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.910" end="00:38:43.560" style="s2">another time what I&#39;m saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.470" end="00:38:45.960" style="s2">sense of logos and love together which</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.560" end="00:38:47.880" style="s2">makes me think of we need a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.960" end="00:38:50.520" style="s2">about how that integration goes together</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.880" end="00:38:52.860" style="s2">with the reason imagination integration</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.520" end="00:38:55.650" style="s2">there&#39;s they speak to each other in some</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.860" end="00:38:59.150" style="s2">way but that that is also missing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.650" end="00:39:01.410" style="s2">Heidegger love like that which is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.150" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">because you see that deep integration</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.410" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">between logos and love of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:08.190" style="s2">exemplified you know in Plato I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:10.230" style="s2">that the two are inseparably bound</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.190" end="00:39:12.570" style="s2">together and of course our culture and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.230" end="00:39:14.310" style="s2">in both Enlightenment and forms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.570" end="00:39:17.700" style="s2">romanticism are responsible for this</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.310" end="00:39:21.090" style="s2">divorce too right yeah yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.700" end="00:39:22.410" style="s2">I mean just leap in their babies logos</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.090" end="00:39:25.170" style="s2">and arrows</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.410" end="00:39:26.610" style="s2">you know arrows I think but if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.170" end="00:39:29.190" style="s2">been added together they make philia</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.610" end="00:39:31.110" style="s2">they make free yeah I&#39;m the point about</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.190" end="00:39:33.090" style="s2">friendship as a kind of love is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.110" end="00:39:35.070" style="s2">you want your friends to be both fully</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.090" end="00:39:39.300" style="s2">themselves while you&#39;re fully your so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.070" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">exactly exactly yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.300" end="00:39:42.180" style="s2">when you have your conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:45.150" style="s2">people and see the other thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.180" end="00:39:48.180" style="s2">right yes and then and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.150" end="00:39:51.300" style="s2">sense also you get a sense of calling at</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.180" end="00:39:53.130" style="s2">times and and in and and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.300" end="00:39:56.040" style="s2">see this more you don&#39;t see this at</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.130" end="00:39:59.340" style="s2">least clearly in Plato but you you catch</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.040" end="00:40:00.530" style="s2">it in Augustine very much that the file</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.340" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">Lia can</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.530" end="00:40:05.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what they can deduce you it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:08.840" style="s2">can draw you towards agape it can is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.630" end="00:40:10.520" style="s2">there the there you wanting to matter to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.840" end="00:40:14.810" style="s2">something beyond yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.520" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2">took you know and it&#39;s right it&#39;s it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.810" end="00:40:19.400" style="s2">it&#39;s completely Rhys entering so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.150" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">know there&#39;s egocentric and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.400" end="00:40:24.650" style="s2">sort of you know polar centric info Leah</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:26.870" style="s2">and then there&#39;s Anto centric in in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.650" end="00:40:32.300" style="s2">agape and what&#39;s interesting also is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.870" end="00:40:38.630" style="s2">that turn because what&#39;s what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.300" end="00:40:41.210" style="s2">hear bar fields notion of creativity as</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.630" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">distinct from just our notions of making</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.210" end="00:40:46.310" style="s2">or sort of decadent romantic notions of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:50.360" style="s2">pure self-expression right the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.310" end="00:40:53.210" style="s2">creativity can I don&#39;t know can conduce</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.360" end="00:40:55.490" style="s2">us into agape by making us aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.210" end="00:40:59.210" style="s2">creativity of God is that a fair thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.490" end="00:41:01.190" style="s2">to say is that is that fair yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.210" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">think that the notion of the Incarnation</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.190" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">the Christian notion there is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:08.300" style="s2">that the and the the deepest meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:11.060" style="s2">the Incarnation is not something to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.300" end="00:41:13.010" style="s2">happen 2,000 years ago that was just</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.060" end="00:41:15.620" style="s2">what made us aware of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.010" end="00:41:18.320" style="s2">happening in every creative moment which</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.620" end="00:41:22.460" style="s2">is that the divine is coming into human</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.320" end="00:41:24.260" style="s2">form into the material world and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.460" end="00:41:27.320" style="s2">creative that&#39;s how you know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.260" end="00:41:32.290" style="s2">happens you know so for example I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.320" end="00:41:35.390" style="s2">music is a very example of this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.290" end="00:41:36.920" style="s2">music is this strange thing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.390" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">kind of in between worlds that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.920" end="00:41:41.090" style="s2">physical thing I&#39;m its acoustic but if</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:42.530" style="s2">you just successful music by security</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.090" end="00:41:44.630" style="s2">properties you gap so you know where</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.530" end="00:41:48.440" style="s2">that&#39;s run but their question is then</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.630" end="00:41:49.010" style="s2">where does what on USS music by can it</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.440" end="00:41:53.080" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.010" end="00:41:55.550" style="s2">yeah and there would be a sort of more a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.080" end="00:41:57.170" style="s2">narrower romantic view that would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.550" end="00:41:59.390" style="s2">for example it&#39;s the power of expression</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.170" end="00:42:02.450" style="s2">and so on but that doesn&#39;t really feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:04.190" style="s2">to take you very far and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.450" end="00:42:07.730" style="s2">again have this sense that you know when</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.190" end="00:42:11.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve listened to Mozart or also barks</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.730" end="00:42:13.010" style="s2">a particularly you know the your</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.300" end="00:42:13.900" style="s2">experience of life has greatly grown</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.010" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">it&#39;s long as your</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.900" end="00:42:18.580" style="s2">expression but something&#39;s been given to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:21.730" style="s2">you yeah yeah and you know Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.580" end="00:42:24.910" style="s2">thought that that&#39;s because the music</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.730" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">both does something on the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.910" end="00:42:31.000" style="s2">but also transpose is something on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:35.080" style="s2">vertical as well and that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.000" end="00:42:37.690" style="s2">exists in the imaginal zone in an</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.080" end="00:42:40.540" style="s2">intermediate zone very much very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.690" end="00:42:41.830" style="s2">yeah so it is that I&#39;m not quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.540" end="00:42:44.890" style="s2">why fully on sir what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.830" end="00:42:46.630" style="s2">there no no let me try and feed it back</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.890" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">to you through what you said what what</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.630" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to suggest is when in a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.000" end="00:42:53.500" style="s2">of Winnicott here also the transitional</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:56.020" style="s2">object and serious play but when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.500" end="00:42:59.230" style="s2">involved in serious playing of and with</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.020" end="00:43:00.610" style="s2">music right and especially like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.230" end="00:43:03.460" style="s2">doing something like jazz where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.610" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">actually not just listening but feeding</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.460" end="00:43:09.580" style="s2">back in creativity right that when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:12.370" style="s2">went there&#39;s a notion of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.580" end="00:43:14.200" style="s2">there that transcends the making or</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.370" end="00:43:17.830" style="s2">transcends the expressive notions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.200" end="00:43:19.690" style="s2">creativity and gives us a sense of right</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.830" end="00:43:21.910" style="s2">it&#39;s and we could we can only</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.690" end="00:43:23.950" style="s2">participate okay I&#39;ll try I&#39;ll try a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.910" end="00:43:25.630" style="s2">bold hypothesis and then you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.950" end="00:43:29.410" style="s2">criticize it if you want we only can</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.630" end="00:43:32.770" style="s2">participate in the creativity that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.410" end="00:43:34.840" style="s2">God God&#39;s a gapek love when we can get</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.770" end="00:43:36.700" style="s2">to that kind of creativity to some</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.840" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">degree in ourselves well or actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.700" end="00:43:41.890" style="s2">between us and the world and music is</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:43.780" style="s2">something like that I think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.890" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">music is so prevalent when people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.780" end="00:43:49.030" style="s2">trying to get their most you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:50.920" style="s2">pertinent representations or symbols of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.030" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">the experience of sacredness they often</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.920" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">resort to music and musical analogies</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:56.380" style="s2">it&#39;s pervasive through Taoism as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:58.090" style="s2">probably know I&#39;m a Tai Chi Chuan player</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.380" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">and notice the word by the way I&#39;m a Tai</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.090" end="00:44:04.600" style="s2">Chi Chuan Claire alright that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s the Chinese right and so like let</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.600" end="00:44:06.970" style="s2">me give you an analogy from that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.770" end="00:44:09.070" style="s2">tradition then I&#39;ll give it back to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.970" end="00:44:11.310" style="s2">and see if I&#39;m if we are getting in sync</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.070" end="00:44:14.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t really understand the Dao</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.310" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">until you play Tai Chi and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.830" end="00:44:20.320" style="s2">that musical sense of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.500" end="00:44:22.420" style="s2">participating in a kind of creativity as</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.320" end="00:44:24.100" style="s2">you say it&#39;s not a creativity even of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.420" end="00:44:27.340" style="s2">work of art it&#39;s a creativity of a way</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.100" end="00:44:29.290" style="s2">of being and that discloses to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.340" end="00:44:31.660" style="s2">in a participatory fashion the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.290" end="00:44:34.090" style="s2">creativity of ways of being that is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.660" end="00:44:35.380" style="s2">DAO that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say does</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.090" end="00:44:38.700" style="s2">that is that resonating with you is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.380" end="00:44:41.110" style="s2">landing for you yeah I mean for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.700" end="00:44:44.760" style="s2">music analogy works for me because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.110" end="00:44:46.630" style="s2">play the piano there you go and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.760" end="00:44:48.670" style="s2">remember when I first started having</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.630" end="00:44:50.650" style="s2">jazz improvisation lessons for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.670" end="00:44:52.120" style="s2">and I thought that I was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.650" end="00:44:54.040" style="s2">given this somehow this kind of magic</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.120" end="00:44:56.830" style="s2">that I&#39;d suddenly just be able to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.040" end="00:45:01.510" style="s2">playing jazz and then I spent the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.830" end="00:45:03.850" style="s2">five years basically doing scales and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.510" end="00:45:06.810" style="s2">and and and and that the point of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.850" end="00:45:10.330" style="s2">is that all that work is required yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.810" end="00:45:14.410" style="s2">your participation in this whole musical</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.330" end="00:45:16.090" style="s2">cosmos is required before maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.410" end="00:45:18.010" style="s2">something else can start to kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.090" end="00:45:20.230" style="s2">all will flow for your fingers right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.010" end="00:45:22.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve never actually I&#39;m not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.230" end="00:45:25.390" style="s2">jazz at all really I&#39;m not but they did</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.810" end="00:45:26.920" style="s2">what it did help me experience on</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.390" end="00:45:29.470" style="s2">occasion is sheet music</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.920" end="00:45:31.630" style="s2">every so often you realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.470" end="00:45:33.220" style="s2">music is kind of playing you brains</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.630" end="00:45:38.530" style="s2">rather than you trying to play the music</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:40.870" style="s2">and you know so the DAO playing with the</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.870" end="00:45:44.740" style="s2">similar kind of experience so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.510" end="00:45:48.670" style="s2">trying to get is that&#39;s what you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">did that to me it&#39;s conducive or</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:01.750" style="s2">than the music belongs to you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.470" end="00:46:03.580" style="s2">not a passive belonging it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.750" end="00:46:05.140" style="s2">you&#39;re just right right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.580" end="00:46:08.890" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get at and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.140" end="00:46:10.630" style="s2">what I see if III don&#39;t know Markel as</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.890" end="00:46:12.700" style="s2">DP as you do but I see when he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.630" end="00:46:14.740" style="s2">to talk about poesis that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.700" end="00:46:16.630" style="s2">here he&#39;s trying to if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.740" end="00:46:18.910" style="s2">now to really pack into this word he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.630" end="00:46:20.590" style="s2">trying to say see police&#39; says playing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.910" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">with language in a way that affords that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.590" end="00:46:26.290" style="s2">flick that&#39;s how I&#39;m seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:29.290" style="s2">Barfield is doing yeah so I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.290" end="00:46:32.470" style="s2">prior thought and natsu backing get a</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.290" end="00:46:34.450" style="s2">bit more Barfield to sort of to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.470" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">with that I mean one one thought which</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.450" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">is a key thing is that it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:41.010" style="s2">particular that is universe or not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:43.140" style="s2">general yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.010" end="00:46:44.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s when somebody becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.140" end="00:46:48.690" style="s2">more and more itself that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.840" end="00:46:51.120" style="s2">universal not because it kind of becomes</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.690" end="00:46:54.570" style="s2">general and you know certainly won the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.120" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">battles criticisms of say look would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">that they tried to separate subject from</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:04.530" style="s2">object try to say that what was most</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">abstract was most true whereas you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.530" end="00:47:10.590" style="s2">Barfield would say no actually it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:14.460" style="s2">the least alive and it has its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.590" end="00:47:16.320" style="s2">uses and particularly if you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.460" end="00:47:19.050" style="s2">things like make machines and that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.320" end="00:47:20.580" style="s2">don&#39;t really need to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.050" end="00:47:23.430" style="s2">although the risk is that you forget</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.580" end="00:47:27.180" style="s2">about your own vitality if life gets too</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.430" end="00:47:29.400" style="s2">you know taken up with machines but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.180" end="00:47:32.130" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about that how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.400" end="00:47:35.310" style="s2">very much the the particular that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.130" end="00:47:37.590" style="s2">for that access is the universal not the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.310" end="00:47:41.190" style="s2">general right which you would criticize</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.590" end="00:47:42.660" style="s2">and so making is artistic rather than</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.190" end="00:47:46.050" style="s2">machine like that that&#39;s why I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.660" end="00:47:49.410" style="s2">trying to get to Rand so poesis you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.050" end="00:47:51.720" style="s2">is it can mean you know making like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.410" end="00:47:53.430" style="s2">pot has a pope the potter has a poetess</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.720" end="00:47:55.950" style="s2">in ancient greek but there&#39;s a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.430" end="00:47:58.560" style="s2">why it&#39;s kind of got become poetry now</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.950" end="00:48:01.370" style="s2">is that this was seen as a sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.560" end="00:48:04.280" style="s2">the kind of materiality you might say of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.370" end="00:48:08.610" style="s2">what you might make a potter household</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.280" end="00:48:12.120" style="s2">to to make something human out of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.610" end="00:48:12.870" style="s2">material and again i mean i got this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.120" end="00:48:14.490" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.870" end="00:48:15.600" style="s2">i think this is an another figure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.490" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">becoming more and more important for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.600" end="00:48:18.990" style="s2">actually is William Blake and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:21.000" style="s2">think that Blake understood a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.990" end="00:48:24.660" style="s2">this you know he he has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.000" end="00:48:27.030" style="s2">different levels of engagement with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:29.790" style="s2">world which he uses he has names for it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.030" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">which I do syncretic to him but</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.790" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">essentially what he&#39;s doing is saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">you know you can move from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:40.190" style="s2">abstract dead you know reason in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:43.590" style="s2">more logical coherent kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.190" end="00:48:46.170" style="s2">through what he called generation which</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.590" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">is a bit more like the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.170" end="00:48:52.590" style="s2">processes of nature and are very thick</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:54.930" style="s2">guns but aren&#39;t very conscious through</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.590" end="00:48:57.569" style="s2">to a level which is much more about</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.930" end="00:48:59.640" style="s2">so you kind of seek the beloved and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.569" end="00:49:03.480" style="s2">nature becomes a more of an eyes our</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.640" end="00:49:05.369" style="s2">relationship with others as well and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.480" end="00:49:07.380" style="s2">then you know the highest level for him</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.369" end="00:49:09.690" style="s2">is what he called Eden which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.380" end="00:49:11.670" style="s2">the creative level where you&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:12.210" style="s2">joined in the whole dance of creation if</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.670" end="00:49:15.349" style="s2">you like</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.210" end="00:49:19.769" style="s2">you&#39;ll make you&#39;re as much a maker as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.349" end="00:49:21.259" style="s2">as an enjoyer as a delight er and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.769" end="00:49:23.910" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.259" end="00:49:25.019" style="s2">so I resonate with that quite deeply so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.910" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">the first thing you said was really</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.019" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">important and there&#39;s I mean you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:34.230" style="s2">that for me I get this much more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">presented in in some Buddhist philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.230" end="00:49:38.519" style="s2">the idea of you know the inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.200" style="s2">Ness the more Ness that I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.519" end="00:49:41.519" style="s2">the inexhaustible missed that Schlegel</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.200" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">talks about and Schlegel had a huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.519" end="00:49:45.869" style="s2">influence on Coleridge who had a huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:47.279" style="s2">influence on Barfield so and the future</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.869" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">actually talks about that a lot at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.279" end="00:49:50.759" style="s2">integral but that that more Ness comes</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:53.130" style="s2">into what the Buddhists call the section</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.759" end="00:49:55.589" style="s2">Asst the section of this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.130" end="00:49:57.539" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about right that part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.589" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">it that I can only I can only come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.539" end="00:50:00.779" style="s2">know through having an either</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:02.670" style="s2">relationship with it but that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.779" end="00:50:04.680" style="s2">relationship with it doesn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.670" end="00:50:06.779" style="s2">sort of doesn&#39;t enclose it in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.680" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">finitude it actually makes it you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.779" end="00:50:11.369" style="s2">open to the more nests and yet you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.230" style="s2">this is Blakes to see the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.369" end="00:50:16.410" style="s2">grain of sand and heaven in a wild</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.230" end="00:50:18.569" style="s2">flower kind of idea which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.410" end="00:50:22.769" style="s2">very resonant but the thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.569" end="00:50:25.589" style="s2">then I get when I&#39;m hearing that okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.769" end="00:50:27.869" style="s2">and then this is this has to do again</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.589" end="00:50:29.970" style="s2">with dialectic is all the stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.869" end="00:50:32.190" style="s2">from the Neil Neil Neil platonic</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.970" end="00:50:34.109" style="s2">tradition because you have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.190" end="00:50:35.519" style="s2">you know pearl talks about it and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.109" end="00:50:37.109" style="s2">of his work about this deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.519" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">correspondence between levels of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.109" end="00:50:41.250" style="s2">consciousness and levels of being and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:43.319" style="s2">how they mutually afford and disclose</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.250" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">each other and that there are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.319" end="00:50:49.950" style="s2">askesis there&#39;s spiritual disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:52.829" style="s2">that can afford us both realizing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.950" end="00:50:57.990" style="s2">ascension to the one but also realizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.829" end="00:51:00.180" style="s2">you know the emanation to to all of all</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.990" end="00:51:02.940" style="s2">of reality and what&#39;s what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.180" end="00:51:06.900" style="s2">to me about that is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.940" end="00:51:08.410" style="s2">dialectic gets gets really deepened in</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.900" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">the neoplatonist</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.410" end="00:51:13.420" style="s2">something as you said horizontally</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:15.160" style="s2">between us but also vertically you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.420" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">between the levels the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.160" end="00:51:19.840" style="s2">levels and and you see that very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:22.570" style="s2">in the workbook what kind of that those</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.840" end="00:51:23.970" style="s2">two senses are bound together and one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.570" end="00:51:26.020" style="s2">the things I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.970" end="00:51:28.810" style="s2">articulate with the help of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.020" end="00:51:31.650" style="s2">people both in text and in person is</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.810" end="00:51:34.150" style="s2">trying to get back that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.650" end="00:51:36.850" style="s2">dialectic and this attitude this</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.150" end="00:51:39.070" style="s2">existential mode of the Ilocos relating</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.850" end="00:51:41.820" style="s2">to the logos precisely mark because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.070" end="00:51:44.140" style="s2">think it&#39;s really needed right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.820" end="00:51:47.140" style="s2">well for two reasons let me just briefly</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.140" end="00:51:48.790" style="s2">say and then I&#39;ll let you respond one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.140" end="00:51:50.830" style="s2">course is just a general point about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.790" end="00:51:53.470" style="s2">meaning crisis and that&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.830" end="00:51:55.510" style="s2">critical in the ancient sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.470" end="00:51:58.840" style="s2">word crisis you know mode of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.510" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">thing but also increasingly because in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.840" end="00:52:02.440" style="s2">response to the meeting crisis there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">all these movements of authentic dial</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.440" end="00:52:06.730" style="s2">discourse circling practices and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:08.860" style="s2">know and I&#39;m doing a lot of participant</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.730" end="00:52:11.740" style="s2">observation in them and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.860" end="00:52:13.450" style="s2">and one of the things and I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.740" end="00:52:15.160" style="s2">I mean I mean discourse is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.450" end="00:52:17.050" style="s2">originators of this guy sense sake he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.160" end="00:52:18.370" style="s2">very open to this point what I see</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.050" end="00:52:23.800" style="s2">missing from a lot of these authentic</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.370" end="00:52:26.620" style="s2">things is philosophy uh that cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.800" end="00:52:28.510" style="s2">of wisdom and I use that term just as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.620" end="00:52:31.630" style="s2">way of distinguishing from just academic</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.510" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">philosophy philosophy a-- which i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.630" end="00:52:36.280" style="s2">is inseparably bound up with this deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:40.150" style="s2">appreciation in the multiple senses of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:42.370" style="s2">the word appreciation of logos that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.150" end="00:52:44.980" style="s2">there&#39;s an implicit sense of it in these</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.370" end="00:52:47.130" style="s2">practices but it hasn&#39;t been explicate</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.980" end="00:52:50.770" style="s2">&#39;add and that explication has not wet it</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.130" end="00:52:52.390" style="s2">wetted it to philosophy a-- enough and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.770" end="00:52:54.430" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think getting this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.390" end="00:52:56.650" style="s2">stuff out is really crucially important</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.430" end="00:52:58.180" style="s2">especially right now especially right</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.650" end="00:53:00.310" style="s2">now when people are more and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.180" end="00:53:02.820" style="s2">turning to dialogue and discourse to try</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.310" end="00:53:06.850" style="s2">and find out what really matters to them</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.820" end="00:53:11.290" style="s2">ya know I think I feel that very</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.850" end="00:53:13.230" style="s2">powerfully too and I mean what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.290" end="00:53:15.460" style="s2">me when are you talking there was how</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.230" end="00:53:17.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of therapeutic approach</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.460" end="00:53:21.160" style="s2">for lots of these practices you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.110" end="00:53:22.450" style="s2">obviously meditation and others that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.160" end="00:53:24.700" style="s2">be very useful</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.450" end="00:53:27.700" style="s2">it can help people feel a lot calmer in</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.700" end="00:53:29.380" style="s2">life and even has the kind of insight</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.700" end="00:53:32.920" style="s2">capacity where people can understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.380" end="00:53:36.430" style="s2">their inner lives more subtly but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.920" end="00:53:37.000" style="s2">think also you do need some metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.430" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.000" end="00:53:40.510" style="s2">yeah because otherwise you get very good</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:42.510" style="s2">understand your own inner life but it</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.510" end="00:53:45.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really take you anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.510" end="00:53:49.720" style="s2">and that ultimately is dissatisfying</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.940" end="00:53:53.170" style="s2">and that what the reason the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.720" end="00:53:56.109" style="s2">can help you do is discern both the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.170" end="00:53:58.990" style="s2">richness of a particular tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.109" end="00:54:02.440" style="s2">that is as much about learning and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.990" end="00:54:04.030" style="s2">as it is about the practice and it helps</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.440" end="00:54:06.520" style="s2">you discern and grow your practice too</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.030" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">as a result and but at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.520" end="00:54:11.910" style="s2">day also helps you see how the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:14.650" style="s2">itself is just a channel and is just</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.910" end="00:54:17.859" style="s2">kind of symbols that itself transmits</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.650" end="00:54:20.609" style="s2">something more than just yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.859" end="00:54:24.190" style="s2">think that that&#39;s what learning and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.609" end="00:54:26.530" style="s2">the metaphysical side can can give you I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.190" end="00:54:28.690" style="s2">actually got this that I was just trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.530" end="00:54:33.670" style="s2">to remember it and book on I am Blucas</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.690" end="00:54:37.030" style="s2">so I found actually really yeah Theo G</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.670" end="00:54:43.000" style="s2">in the soul yes yeah yeah it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.030" end="00:54:45.369" style="s2">book I love the way that the awesome I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.000" end="00:54:47.380" style="s2">forget which is bad anyway he breaks</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.369" end="00:54:50.099" style="s2">down and these different levels and</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.380" end="00:54:52.119" style="s2">talks about how you know say them</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.099" end="00:54:54.579" style="s2">because understood that the material</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.119" end="00:54:57.579" style="s2">ever of reality has its own way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.579" end="00:55:00.430" style="s2">refracting reflect doing divine reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.579" end="00:55:02.349" style="s2">and that at certain times engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.430" end="00:55:04.690" style="s2">material realities absolutely crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.349" end="00:55:06.819" style="s2">open yourself up to that level and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.690" end="00:55:10.150" style="s2">there&#39;s the intermediate levels which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.819" end="00:55:12.220" style="s2">more you know like say more like reason</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.150" end="00:55:14.710" style="s2">but reason in the sense of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.220" end="00:55:17.170" style="s2">kind of bring something into minds to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.710" end="00:55:19.810" style="s2">engage the local capture and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.170" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">feel the resonance with it and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.810" end="00:55:25.810" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of no exit level which</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:27.220" style="s2">moves beyond a reason and is say more</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.810" end="00:55:28.599" style="s2">ecstatic or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.220" end="00:55:29.109" style="s2">might have really communication and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.599" end="00:55:31.720" style="s2">cosinus</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.109" end="00:55:33.329" style="s2">yeah yeah I love that how this the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.720" end="00:55:36.339" style="s2">integration of all those three level</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.329" end="00:55:38.469" style="s2">understand is in is it in iron because</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.339" end="00:55:41.170" style="s2">and I&#39;ve tried to work this out in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.469" end="00:55:44.489" style="s2">own therapy practice actually healing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.170" end="00:55:46.809" style="s2">the sense of you know being more open to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.489" end="00:55:48.339" style="s2">not just what&#39;s going on for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.809" end="00:55:49.779" style="s2">individual and their only life which you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.339" end="00:55:53.079" style="s2">have to do all that work because</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.779" end="00:55:54.940" style="s2">otherwise people never you know realize</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.079" end="00:55:58.479" style="s2">that their own inner life is not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.940" end="00:56:00.609" style="s2">whole cosmos but the minute people can</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.479" end="00:56:03.130" style="s2">begin to kind of step back from a bit a</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.609" end="00:56:06.249" style="s2">bit to bring in something else that</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.130" end="00:56:07.509" style="s2">takes people into these wider and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.249" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">often happens quite naturally because</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.509" end="00:56:11.019" style="s2">people have I don&#39;t know they have</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:12.309" style="s2">synchronistic experiences or their</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.019" end="00:56:13.809" style="s2">dreams seem to be not just about</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.309" end="00:56:15.489" style="s2">themselves or they get interested in</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.809" end="00:56:17.979" style="s2">Alan Watts videos or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.489" end="00:56:21.339" style="s2">you know and then and then you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.979" end="00:56:23.140" style="s2">of help that expansion to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.339" end="00:56:25.479" style="s2">wonderful I thought oh yeah a picture</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.140" end="00:56:28.150" style="s2">it&#39;s sure a theory that&#39;s why I did it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.479" end="00:56:29.380" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great book and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.150" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">what he writes is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.380" end="00:56:33.309" style="s2">yeah so I am Blucas and then later</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">Provost differ from Platonists in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.309" end="00:56:38.499" style="s2">they both - Tom the material world is</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:41.849" style="s2">sort of ultimately close to prime matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.499" end="00:56:44.589" style="s2">which he plated with evil I am Lucas and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.849" end="00:56:47.369" style="s2">Brooke lists are much more positively</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.589" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">disposed towards the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.369" end="00:56:52.509" style="s2">although I think I&#39;m because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:56.170" style="s2">understood that the evil ultimately for</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.509" end="00:56:58.390" style="s2">all that it can be foul it&#39;s a falling</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.170" end="00:56:59.890" style="s2">away from being yeah so the material</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.390" end="00:57:03.759" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t fall away from being it</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.890" end="00:57:05.769" style="s2">definitely is that&#39;s well certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.759" end="00:57:07.989" style="s2">that&#39;s very well</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.769" end="00:57:10.180" style="s2">and then the interesting thing about I</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.989" end="00:57:12.729" style="s2">am blackest onward is in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.180" end="00:57:15.819" style="s2">theoria right which is the contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.729" end="00:57:18.190" style="s2">practices you bring in theory Jia which</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.819" end="00:57:20.319" style="s2">are these ritual practices and and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.190" end="00:57:22.509" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a weaving</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.319" end="00:57:24.099" style="s2">together of philosophy and religion that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.509" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2">until recently was really looked down</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.099" end="00:57:28.299" style="s2">upon in academic scholarship but within</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:30.249" style="s2">the laughs especially because of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.299" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">work of people like Shaw we&#39;ve now come</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.249" end="00:57:35.109" style="s2">back and appreciate wait wait wait we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:37.299" style="s2">doing a lot of this like we do you often</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.109" end="00:57:39.009" style="s2">people you know thanks to the work of LA</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.299" end="00:57:40.900" style="s2">Paul and I in this color I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.009" end="00:57:42.339" style="s2">this in my series you know going through</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.900" end="00:57:43.719" style="s2">these transformative experiences these</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.339" end="00:57:45.069" style="s2">are not things you can sort of reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.719" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">your way through you need these symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.069" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">you need Winnicott you need these</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:50.230" style="s2">transitional zones and objects right it</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:52.540" style="s2">and you have to play with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.230" end="00:57:56.380" style="s2">seriously and so you know they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.540" end="00:57:59.140" style="s2">there is a deeply important role in</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.380" end="00:58:02.109" style="s2">aspiring to become other than what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.140" end="00:58:05.800" style="s2">are for you know this kind of serious</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.109" end="00:58:09.220" style="s2">play this is serious symbolic play so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.800" end="00:58:11.109" style="s2">just the notion of ritual I feel is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.220" end="00:58:13.090" style="s2">increasingly important actually and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.109" end="00:58:13.840" style="s2">and again it&#39;s Plato you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.090" end="00:58:16.270" style="s2">things which I never really understood</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.840" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">when I study my PhD was why I know</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.270" end="00:58:20.280" style="s2">people always disappearing off to</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:22.990" style="s2">perform rites in platonic dialogue or</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.280" end="00:58:25.180" style="s2">Plato then ends the dialogue with a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.990" end="00:58:30.280" style="s2">whole myth as if yet somehow the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.180" end="00:58:32.680" style="s2">grand finale and I think yeah I think is</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.280" end="00:58:36.520" style="s2">the whole point actually you need these</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.680" end="00:58:38.800" style="s2">multiple levels of engagement yes be</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.520" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">able to participate in what&#39;s being sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.800" end="00:58:43.750" style="s2">of discussed and revealed yes and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:46.090" style="s2">other like rituals because they do have</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.150" end="00:59:01.210" style="s2">know about is a very expansive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:03.400" style="s2">gesture I agree and one of the</p>

<p begin="00:59:06.670" end="00:59:11.010" style="s2">because I&#39;ve done them extensively that</p>

<p begin="00:59:25.660" end="00:59:28.690" style="s2">own sake and so you take a music</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.690" end="00:59:31.900" style="s2">kinds of arguments about like why you</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:34.390" style="s2">can&#39;t reason your way into that because</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.900" end="00:59:35.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t have that value you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.540" end="00:59:41.800" style="s2">that identity so you write and you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:45.670" end="00:59:50.740" style="s2">use any sort of standard decision matrix</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.340" end="00:59:52.420" style="s2">inferential processes and what you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.740" end="00:59:54.670" style="s2">to basically do I argue is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.420" end="00:59:56.560" style="s2">go you you you train you do this you</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.670" end="00:59:59.050" style="s2">basically afford appreciation through</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.560" end="01:00:01.030" style="s2">sort of ritual behavior where you you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.050" end="01:00:02.770" style="s2">you get into this liminal zone where you</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.030" end="01:00:03.880" style="s2">play between worlds until you get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.770" end="01:00:07.089" style="s2">taste and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.880" end="01:00:08.829" style="s2">right but what to bring that back if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.089" end="01:00:10.750" style="s2">accept that core argument and I make it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.829" end="01:00:13.500" style="s2">more rigorously elsewhere right about</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.750" end="01:00:15.430" style="s2">the role of let&#39;s call it ritual in</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.500" end="01:00:17.950" style="s2">aspiration by which we come to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.430" end="01:00:20.170" style="s2">appreciate again both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.950" end="01:00:24.279" style="s2">or actually all three senses evaluation</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.170" end="01:00:26.500" style="s2">understanding and liking right right she</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.279" end="01:00:28.869" style="s2">says look and she doesn&#39;t quite make</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.500" end="01:00:31.180" style="s2">this explicit but it&#39;s definitely at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.869" end="01:00:34.660" style="s2">core for argument we aspire to being</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.180" end="01:00:37.029" style="s2">rational we aspire to being rational and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.660" end="01:00:39.549" style="s2">it could be I&#39;m I&#39;m not as rational as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.029" end="01:00:41.740" style="s2">should be or could be and I aspire to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.549" end="01:00:43.420" style="s2">that and but that is also and she said</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.740" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">and here&#39;s that here&#39;s the crucial thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.420" end="01:00:49.930" style="s2">if we if that aspirational process -</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:52.869" style="s2">rationality is not itself an inferential</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.930" end="01:00:55.269" style="s2">process but if we say it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.869" end="01:00:57.160" style="s2">rationality we fall into a performative</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.269" end="01:00:58.809" style="s2">self contradiction because we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.160" end="01:01:00.430" style="s2">recommend it anybody become more</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.809" end="01:01:01.960" style="s2">rational because we would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.430" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">recommending to them a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.960" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">irrational process so we have to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:09.160" style="s2">identity calls it proleptic rationality</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">and the reason why I&#39;m bringing that up</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.160" end="01:01:15.130" style="s2">is you know that again these things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:17.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended to push aside you can see</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.130" end="01:01:20.650" style="s2">now there&#39;s for modern work is now</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.710" end="01:01:23.109" style="s2">coming no no no you know ritual and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.650" end="01:01:25.000" style="s2">rationality are deeply interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.109" end="01:01:27.490" style="s2">in a way in which because you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.000" end="01:01:30.130" style="s2">ritual was one of the hobgoblins of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.490" end="01:01:32.140" style="s2">Enlightenment philosopher a ritual</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.130" end="01:01:35.529" style="s2">behavior was the meaningless useless</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.140" end="01:01:39.190" style="s2">magical behavior but it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.529" end="01:01:41.049" style="s2">it&#39;s actually integral in fact like like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.190" end="01:01:44.950" style="s2">to your very conception of rationality</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.049" end="01:01:48.759" style="s2">you can&#39;t separate the two out in any</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.950" end="01:01:51.700" style="s2">clean fashion yeah yeah again a couple</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.759" end="01:01:54.339" style="s2">of thoughts the the Buffett was</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.700" end="01:01:56.109" style="s2">certainly very aware of one was the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.339" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">way that the medieval world understood</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.109" end="01:01:59.769" style="s2">the sort of the grammar of a sense if</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:02.130" style="s2">you like you know begins with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.769" end="01:02:04.930" style="s2">literal goes through the allegorical</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.130" end="01:02:06.069" style="s2">which is sort of the moral level kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.930" end="01:02:08.380" style="s2">tells you a bit about how to live</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.069" end="01:02:10.089" style="s2">there&#39;s the crucial topological moment</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.380" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">which is where you&#39;re in that state of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.089" end="01:02:13.000" style="s2">not-knowing</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:15.549" style="s2">struggle but you feel something is</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.000" end="01:02:16.910" style="s2">changing yeah till he gets the an ego</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.549" end="01:02:18.710" style="s2">kick</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.910" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">and a new level I&#39;m an ultimately the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.710" end="01:02:22.850" style="s2">divine level and I think about fielding</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:24.410" style="s2">word their tree and I&#39;m wondering about</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.850" end="01:02:26.030" style="s2">this so I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s quite right</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.410" end="01:02:27.290" style="s2">but what you were just saying there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.030" end="01:02:29.630" style="s2">actually the word intuition</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.290" end="01:02:31.490" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;m Barfield actually from</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.630" end="01:02:33.830" style="s2">Rudolf Steiner which is a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.490" end="01:02:36.290" style="s2">side to him yeah which we do and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.830" end="01:02:37.880" style="s2">understand but but certainly one things</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.290" end="01:02:39.470" style="s2">which I think he did bring into his idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.880" end="01:02:42.950" style="s2">of the imagination is that imagination</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.470" end="01:02:44.870" style="s2">goes through these three three there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.950" end="01:02:47.000" style="s2">the first of those the imagination which</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.870" end="01:02:50.420" style="s2">is mixed up with fantasy and projection</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.000" end="01:02:52.940" style="s2">and so on it&#39;s discerned and becomes</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.420" end="01:02:55.100" style="s2">inspiration because you get a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.940" end="01:02:58.730" style="s2">what you&#39;re receiving and but when that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.100" end="01:03:00.410" style="s2">inspiration is fully sort of becomes</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.730" end="01:03:02.210" style="s2">part of your consciousness becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.410" end="01:03:04.250" style="s2">rational in that big more expansive</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.210" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">sense and it becomes an intuition that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.250" end="01:03:10.460" style="s2">you&#39;re then able to live your life from</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:12.230" style="s2">so it becomes part of reality yes I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.460" end="01:03:13.190" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.230" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">seems to connect with what you were</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.190" end="01:03:16.610" style="s2">saying there a bit it does it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.320" style="s2">circles back around to this different</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.610" end="01:03:19.640" style="s2">attitude towards language again that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.320" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">were talking about earlier because one</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.640" end="01:03:22.250" style="s2">of the places where that comes out for</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:24.230" style="s2">me as I do a practice called Lexi Oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.250" end="01:03:26.450" style="s2">Davina the divine reading and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.230" end="01:03:28.880" style="s2">trying to do exactly that you try to you</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.450" end="01:03:30.020" style="s2">get sort of your initial associations so</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.880" end="01:03:31.580" style="s2">first of all what you do is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.020" end="01:03:33.620" style="s2">just read the text you recite it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.580" end="01:03:35.480" style="s2">what that means is try to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.620" end="01:03:37.940" style="s2">imaginal try to pick up on the metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.480" end="01:03:39.470" style="s2">and try to try to at least imagine what</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.940" end="01:03:42.020" style="s2">it would be like to enact the metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.470" end="01:03:44.120" style="s2">right and then you let the associations</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.020" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">come up and then you try to like you say</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.120" end="01:03:47.870" style="s2">you try to discern between what&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">sort of projected fantasy and then what</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.870" end="01:03:52.850" style="s2">seems to be you&#39;ll allow me and the pun</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:55.700" style="s2">is intended will you get an inkling of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.850" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">well you get an inkling of beyond all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.700" end="01:04:00.680" style="s2">that and then the degree to which that</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:01.790" style="s2">starts to call you out and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.680" end="01:04:03.980" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do it as you move</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.790" end="01:04:05.390" style="s2">through those levels of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.980" end="01:04:06.980" style="s2">reading the text it sounds very similar</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.390" end="01:04:09.500" style="s2">to what you&#39;re saying about how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.980" end="01:04:11.090" style="s2">sort of educating imagination in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.500" end="01:04:12.620" style="s2">powerful way and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.090" end="01:04:14.480" style="s2">because you get this different feel for</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.620" end="01:04:17.330" style="s2">language you get this very different</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.480" end="01:04:20.930" style="s2">feel for language and it was poetry the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.330" end="01:04:22.760" style="s2">awoke Barfield to that here&#39;s why when</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.930" end="01:04:27.770" style="s2">he first met CS Lewis and became one of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.760" end="01:04:29.450" style="s2">the Inklings he he he was very depressed</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.770" end="01:04:30.650" style="s2">in his early 20s he felt very much</p>

<p begin="01:04:32.180" end="01:04:37.400" style="s2">ingrown toenail that I was wearing my</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.700" end="01:04:38.990" style="s2">body like it was ill shape and clothes</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.400" end="01:04:40.690" style="s2">you know all these kind of ways he tried</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.990" end="01:04:43.220" style="s2">to describe it which are very vivid and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.690" end="01:04:45.770" style="s2">two things happened long as he fell in</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.220" end="01:04:48.980" style="s2">love so the eros tension inside him woke</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.770" end="01:04:52.190" style="s2">up and but also he realized that he</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.980" end="01:04:55.220" style="s2">could read poetry but follow the energy</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.190" end="01:04:58.760" style="s2">of the words and resist just immediately</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.220" end="01:05:00.230" style="s2">kind of collapsing interpreting you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.760" end="01:05:01.670" style="s2">sort of trying to pin the poem down</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.230" end="01:05:03.470" style="s2">what&#39;s it really saying that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.670" end="01:05:07.010" style="s2">thing and the point about that I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.470" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">is if you do that too soon you just stay</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.010" end="01:05:11.090" style="s2">in your gerund yet will give you if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:13.610" style="s2">stay in your current consciousness you</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.090" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">need to hold open up all possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.610" end="01:05:17.600" style="s2">something so when you say the next</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:21.110" style="s2">Davina I think it&#39;s very much like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.600" end="01:05:22.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s trying to sort of and it can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.110" end="01:05:24.710" style="s2">very painful and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.460" end="01:05:27.980" style="s2">reasons why death and dying is such a</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.710" end="01:05:30.050" style="s2">central feature of these great wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.980" end="01:05:31.730" style="s2">traditions is that it can be really</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.050" end="01:05:34.370" style="s2">distressing at times and it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.730" end="01:05:36.590" style="s2">okay knows that and you know the a</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.370" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">Poirier in plate so you know basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.590" end="01:05:43.040" style="s2">led to Socrates&#39;s death because it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:48.470" style="s2">too many people play as we recon says</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.040" end="01:05:52.670" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s really yeah okay well</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.470" end="01:05:53.870" style="s2">this mark for fault I think we&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.670" end="01:05:56.540" style="s2">of we came to a place where we could</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.870" end="01:05:58.090" style="s2">serve come to an end I try not to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.540" end="01:06:01.030" style="s2">let these get too long or they become</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.090" end="01:06:03.320" style="s2">people won&#39;t watch them kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.030" end="01:06:04.970" style="s2">first of all I thoroughly enjoyed that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.320" end="01:06:06.680" style="s2">and I would like to extend an invitation</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.970" end="01:06:09.080" style="s2">for you to come back and you and I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.680" end="01:06:11.870" style="s2">another dialogue you know sometime</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.080" end="01:06:14.690" style="s2">within the next month perhaps if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.870" end="01:06:15.740" style="s2">carry this on because I for me I really</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.690" end="01:06:17.060" style="s2">enjoyed this and I felt there was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.740" end="01:06:21.590" style="s2">tremendous amount of resonance between</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.060" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">us and then for me too because it feels</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.590" end="01:06:24.650" style="s2">integrating for me actually with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:26.150" style="s2">work that you&#39;re doing that I have I</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.650" end="01:06:27.590" style="s2">confess I slightly have the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.150" end="01:06:31.040" style="s2">psychotherapists prejudice about</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.590" end="01:06:32.840" style="s2">cognitive science right but I think you</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.040" end="01:06:35.090" style="s2">know I very much being this thing&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.840" end="01:06:36.890" style="s2">you&#39;re saying about the new expansion of</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.090" end="01:06:40.540" style="s2">cognitive science and I thought for</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.890" end="01:06:42.740" style="s2">anything else I I&#39;m very hopeful that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.540" end="01:06:44.420" style="s2">bringing together of these particular</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.740" end="01:06:46.099" style="s2">disciplines which</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.420" end="01:06:47.509" style="s2">the benefit of psychotherapy because</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.099" end="01:06:48.559" style="s2">psychotherapist or his own problems</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.509" end="01:06:51.829" style="s2">happen those as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.559" end="01:06:54.380" style="s2">so yeah I think that apart from anything</p>

<p begin="01:07:48.829" end="01:07:54.349" style="s2">come to the end of and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.930" end="01:07:55.910" style="s2">its excitement I think that a real the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.349" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">cutting out for me more more and I hope</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.910" end="01:08:00.680" style="s2">this might come out for me as I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:02.900" style="s2">about to start the purgatory with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.680" end="01:08:04.849" style="s2">Dante youtubes and then you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.900" end="01:08:07.940" style="s2">go on to the Paradise later this year I</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.849" end="01:08:12.109" style="s2">guess it&#39;s a bit like you know your many</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.940" end="01:08:13.549" style="s2">parts so the meaning crisis yeah I got</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.109" end="01:08:15.529" style="s2">to the end of the inferno just before</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.549" end="01:08:18.130" style="s2">Easter and I felt quite relieved at</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.529" end="01:08:21.319" style="s2">least I&#39;d done something you know but</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.130" end="01:08:25.130" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s it&#39;s I think the Vanguard</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.319" end="01:08:26.630" style="s2">for me is how this connects with you</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.130" end="01:08:29.000" style="s2">know what people might only call BAM</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.630" end="01:08:30.259" style="s2">were a very directly involved with which</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.000" end="01:08:33.259" style="s2">is normally called the esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.259" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">traditions it&#39;s a difficult word because</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.259" end="01:08:37.400" style="s2">it means we&#39;re sort of spooky and</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:40.219" style="s2">mystical not just kind of implicit and</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.400" end="01:08:43.370" style="s2">hidden I think there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.219" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">crucial in all on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.370" end="01:08:46.940" style="s2">experiences that people have and which</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.679" end="01:08:50.150" style="s2">might be called the supernatural the</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.940" end="01:08:51.830" style="s2">paranormal whatever I&#39;m very influenced</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.150" end="01:08:53.810" style="s2">by another psychologists of religion</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.830" end="01:08:56.750" style="s2">called Jeffrey cried bell on this who</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.810" end="01:08:57.319" style="s2">thinks that the reason why people have</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.750" end="01:08:59.270" style="s2">all these</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.319" end="01:09:01.730" style="s2">experiences is that we&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.270" end="01:09:03.259" style="s2">capacity to discern them actually so as</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.730" end="01:09:06.139" style="s2">it were these vitality Zoar this</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.259" end="01:09:07.279" style="s2">intelligence these agencies kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.139" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">impress upon us</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.279" end="01:09:12.230" style="s2">particularly when were in fragile</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:15.799" style="s2">moments we&#39;re not ego strength tends to</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.230" end="01:09:17.210" style="s2">fall apart and how we discern that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.799" end="01:09:19.579" style="s2">think is there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.210" end="01:09:21.529" style="s2">important in that for me it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.579" end="01:09:23.810" style="s2">array packs and we&#39;d be talking about so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.529" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">far but you know I think these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.810" end="01:09:28.460" style="s2">happen and we&#39;ve got to try and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:31.549" style="s2">understand that and so that&#39;s on the one</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.460" end="01:09:34.099" style="s2">hand and then the other hand is what</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.549" end="01:09:37.730" style="s2">this means for religion actually you</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.099" end="01:09:39.710" style="s2">know I sort of Christianity is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.730" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">my tradition and it&#39;s one that you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.710" end="01:09:44.869" style="s2">I feel fairly fluent in I&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:48.469" style="s2">from Buddhism as well but you in terms</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.869" end="01:09:50.779" style="s2">of practices and and what this means for</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.469" end="01:09:52.849" style="s2">a religious worldview because I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.779" end="01:09:54.639" style="s2">feel that the way out of the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.849" end="01:09:58.130" style="s2">crisis is going to look something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.639" end="01:09:59.540" style="s2">the religious imagination and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.130" end="01:10:01.550" style="s2">why I feel that is that I feel it ends</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.540" end="01:10:03.679" style="s2">there we can&#39;t bootstrap our own way out</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.550" end="01:10:06.349" style="s2">of it we are called in so I think into</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.679" end="01:10:08.090" style="s2">relationship with nature with the cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.349" end="01:10:11.900" style="s2">and with the divine I think ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.090" end="01:10:13.940" style="s2">and so staying open to how that might be</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.900" end="01:10:15.920" style="s2">the case and by open I don&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.940" end="01:10:18.650" style="s2">you know not being too skeptical but</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.920" end="01:10:22.760" style="s2">trying to discern the inward flow of</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.650" end="01:10:25.520" style="s2">divine energy you know in the small</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.760" end="01:10:26.900" style="s2">wayside we&#39;ve got gold finches nesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.520" end="01:10:28.639" style="s2">in our garden this spring and during</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.900" end="01:10:31.730" style="s2">this lockdown phase they are like little</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.639" end="01:10:33.590" style="s2">angels expression you know they feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.730" end="01:10:35.780" style="s2">like little centers of energy but a</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.590" end="01:10:38.690" style="s2">calling for something in me as much as</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.780" end="01:10:42.550" style="s2">doing their own thing and so I you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.690" end="01:10:45.349" style="s2">trying to be open to that inferiority is</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.550" end="01:10:48.079" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of where it feels at the</p>
